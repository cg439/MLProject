       Dual drivers for better sound - The M-Duo is perfect for those who want to feel the bass. With a dedicated subwoofer and crossover, each driver reproduces a different part of the frequency spectrum, which ensures your bass kicks hard while the rest of the spectrum remains clean and clear. The M-Duo delivers all of the impact and dynamics in your music. Prevent interruptions and block external noise - the snug in-ear fit and ample ear tips help achieve the best seal for your ears, providing excellent passive noise isolation and preventing others from hearing your music. This reduces interruptions while allowing you to listen at lower volumes, which protects your hearing. Headset functionality with phone and media controls - The M-Duo allows hands-free use of your smartphone or tablet with a high quality inline microphone and remote. Control media and calls without the need to touch your device. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, most Android phones and tablets, Windows phones and tablets, MacBook's, and many laptops.

Included shirt clip and adjustable cable slider keep the cable out of your way, reducing tangles and snags.
