Polk does audio. 40 years of knowledge creates the best headphone experience by far.Polk, world-renowned for its sound quality since 1972, started with a high performance 5.5 mm dynamic driver that exceeded previous drivers we had used in other designs. These drivers were developed with our Dynamic Balance driver design process that uses the variables of materials technology and diaphragm geometry to discover the optimum balance for the drivers’ performance goals.
