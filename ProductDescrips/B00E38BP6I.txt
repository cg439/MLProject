       Award winning sound Retaining the award-winning sound of the original M9, the second generation earphone combines enhanced, yet controlled bass, airy and extended treble, and clarity that accentuates fine details in your music. The impactful, dynamic sound brings your tracks to life and makes higher-quality music files shine. The second generation M9P utilizes a redesigned inline remote unit that incorporates a microphone, remote button, and universal volume control. Take calls and control media on compatible phones, tablets, iPods, and computers and adjust the volume on any device conveniently with the universal volume control. Metal housings with color accents, tangle-free two-tone flat cable, and curved lines look amazing both in-hand and in-ear, providing a refined and elegant style. The angled nozzles improve fitment, allowing the earphones to fit more ears securely and comfortably. The snug in-ear fit and multiple included ear tips help achieve the best seal for your ears, blocking out external noise and preventing others from hearing your music. This reduces interruptions and allows you to listen at lower volumes, protecting your hearing and improving sound quality.
