Importance: 
 Few customers commented the headset can't connect with their phones, this is because they don't hold the switch button long time enough. 
 Some customers turned on the headset and see it blinks blue-red few times, then it start blinking blue fast, thought it is in pairing condition, It's wrong. 
 The correct instruction is you have to press the power button and count from 1 to 10 and then release the button, you could see blue and red light blinks few times first, then blue light flash fast, and then see the blue-red light blinks alternately or hear a beep. Now it can be found by your phone.
