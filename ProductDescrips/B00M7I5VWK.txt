Overview: 
This high-performance zinc alloy earphone produces amazing sound with great bass. With a zinc alloy housing that resonates perfectly in all audio frequencies and a built-in subwoofer to amplify the base, these earphones provide the perfect mix of high and low frequencies. The bass is strong, but not overwhelming to cover the other frequencies, and the sound delivery is much more crisp and clear than other comparable models. The proper fit of your earbuds is crucial to sound production, bass performance, noise reduction and comfort. Three sizes of buds are included to fit almost any ear comfortably for ultimate sound performance.
