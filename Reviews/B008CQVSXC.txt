The right ear bud is low as hell. They also don't fit in my ear. came in a monster beats by dre bag.only plus is they came on time and they look new. I also suspect them to be knock offs
Broken after using few months.
Did not work when received
love my beats great sound but they would fall out my ear but i got the earplugs and all is great
These headphones are so cheap thye are a disgrace to the Beats name I could buy a better pair of headphones at the discount store for under $5. I was totally surprised at the poor quality of these headphones. I returned them the same day.
they're an ok product. The sound is what you would expect, good bass responsible. The buds themselves are really attractive, visually they have a great aesthetic. However, having said that anything plastic feels... cheap. The plastic housing for the mic and audio controls is too large and close to the face. Personally, they cut some comers of you ask me. For a pair of headphones in this (price) category, they're a disappointment, but still somehow worth owning. I would personally go with a pair of Bose IE2's or Sure 215's, or a bit cheaper the Klipsch Image S4's, all better headphones from respected producers of audio gear. Needless to say, Beats haven't beat anything but their bottom line. Lol. If anything.
Okay, mine broke pretty fast
Quality is horrible, it does not stay in ear, and broke within 2 weeks
My niece loves them
It doesn't fit my ears, always falles.Music not clearer as I expected ....
wonderful.
I bought these headphones for my grand daughter for Christmas.  She loved them until they stopped working a few month later, the company apologized and offered a replacement.  The replacement worked for about five months and it too stopped working.  I was willing to try a second replacement in May and now here it is Nov and the second replacement failed too.  I was pleased with Amazon and a full refund but very disappointed in the product.
These are awesome ear buds for non active use and I am not one for sales gimmicks, which most think of with beats, particularly now that a certain someone has bought them. I use these instead of traditional In-ear-monitors, given the response is nearly perfect from high to low frequencies. The ear bud material seems to be made of sound deadening material, which gives more sound immersion to the listener. They might not be the most durable (driver mounts which hold ear cone can break) but they are by far better sound performers than any other headphones in the same price range. I was a sony guy for a long time...but to get this level of audio response from sony, you would have to spend nearly 2-3x as much, not to mention big bulky ear buds when you get to multi drive high end versions.Go dre for pumping out one last good products before selling out!
It was a gift and she loved them.
I love it! Very amazing headphone.
Don't tangle nearly at all. Easy to use and sound quality is great
I have these headphones for a month and for some reason one ear cuts in and out what should I do?
I was disappointed with the base i thought i was gping to be blown away. And the cord is too short hence makes the ear buds to keep popping out. Was better off with the previous brand that i had.
I don't really know as they are a Christmas present for my grandson.
they suck, the sound is ok but they fall out of your ears and when you get them in your ears they have different sounds there for its awast of mony
Garbage. Right earbud stopped working after a year; always kept them in the bag, never abused them in anyway. I THOUGHT the sound quality was great, until I just bought the new SkullCandy Chops In-Ear. The SkullCandy are so much better; bass, highs, mid, and they F'n stay in my ears, all for half the price. Don't waste you're money on the urBeats...they're beat.. Beats by Dre is now a fashion brand who happens to make headphones. Sad.
These broke after a month.  I could have bought 10 pairs of cheap headphones for the same price!
Good.
First off, there are many false reviews here, because people on the internet hate Beats.* Pros: They look cool, they seem durable, they sound good,they are loud, they are very comfortable, they have a lot of bass, and have great noise isolation.* Cons: Price is a bit high, ear buds rubbing together can result in goosebumpsThese earphones come with a very nice carrying pouch that fits perfectly in your pocket, and a few different sizes of ear tips so you are guaranteed to find a pair that fits perfectly for you.I've had them for a few months and I've had no problems at all, which is weird considering the fact that many people here are lying about them breaking after a few weeks.With these in my ear I can barely hear anything even without music playing, and with music you can't hear anything at all.Another great feature is how loud these are. I don't need to go any higher than 40% volume, and when I do there is barely any distortion.Conclusion: If you can afford it, buy it from here. If not, get a used or manufacturer refurbished pair, because these are awesome, and don't let the Beats haters tell you differently.
Loved these until the sound went out in the right earbud. 10 months of use, hubby just shredded last years Christmas receipts, so I'm screwed out of the warranty. First and last Beats purchase. So bummed, because I really liked these. Always took care of them. When not in use I've always carefully put away in the little storage bag that came with them. For this price, they should last much longer.
The quality of sound is great.
Great sound and actually fit my small ears comfortably.
My purpose - I wear (wore) the urBeats to work every day but not for exercising.Sound quality - Great (though I'm no audiophile)Portability - GreatDurability - God awful.  I received these earbuds as a gift less than a year ago and I'm already on my 2nd replacement pair.Price - a bit steep given the durability!Customer service - not great -> no easy way to process returns. You need to call them and deal with less-than-savvy customer service reps who will put you on hold every several times just to tell you that their only replacement inventory consists of pink earbuds and that you'll need to call them back again at another time. (WTF mate?)I really hope Apple works out the kinks here, otherwise I'm done with this company.
On time !
This is not worth it!!!!!!!!!  I repeat, this product is NOT WORTH IT!!!!This is the most expensive earphones, I've ever bought and it was such waste of a $100!!!! They broke 13 months of use. Now, I spent a lot of money on this product so I wanted them to last. Thus, I never took them out of my house. I did not pull on the wires, twist them into a tight ball, or smash/drop them with force.  I've used them only a handful of times.  Furthermore, the warranty doesn't cover anything either!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
I think these were made perfectly to match Apple. Looks good on my gold iPhone 6. All gold everything Baby!!! Fit like normal earbuds and the in-line controls work with my iPhone all day.
The material that the ear buds are made of keeps slipping out of my ear.I tried all the size options and none stayed in.The controller is too high in the wire and using it also pulled the buds out.Poor design.
They work great! Pretty good for $100.00
perfect!!!
Horrible!
My daughter uses them all the time.
I've had my Beats for 10 months now, and they are by far the best headphones I've ever owned. Keep in mind my only other decent earphones are the Klipsch s4i. The sound quality is, to my untrained ear, a smidge better with the Beats, but the kicker is their durability.I've used them during airline travel, and while they aren't isolation level quiet, they help mightily.I've used them to talk and drive, and no one has ever mentioned difficulty hearing me, nor I them.I don't use them for exercise, but I use them almost every day listening to audiobooks and music around the house. I can't count the number of times I've caught them on something and pulled them out of my ears, but no damage to the earphones whatsoever. I've even pulled my iPhone out of my pocket by catching the cord on something or other, but the earphones keep on performing. The 4S needed new glass however.I don't know what to say to those poor souls who've had poor quality Beats, but when I buy a new pair, I'll be buying some of these.Oh, and BTW, the "unboxing experience" is utterly ridiculous. It's frustration free and all, but guys come on I'm buying earphones not packaging. You could probably knock $10.00 off of the price by just doing some simple packing.
It was the great product.  Could not be happier.
nice package and high quality headphones just like that headphones i saw in store
Bought these May 2014 and one of the ear buds has already went bad and it is only Octoberr 2014!!!!
Nice
good
Very disappointed! $100.00+ (shipping not included), is a lot to spend on a set of ear buds/in-ear headphones, especially when you're a single mother that scraped up and saved for months to be able to afford these for her child! Long story short, Christmas came and of course I felt like the best mom in the world, until not even a month later when one side stopped working! I called and emailed Beats numerous times just to be sent through hoop after hoop... Here it is now, almost 2 years later, and I still have the pretty little box with the BROKEN Beats headphones sitting inside, along with all of the fancy little papers and advertisements that came inside of the box. The problem with big name companies such as, Beats (and Apple), are that they spend majority of their time, efforts, and funds on stuff like packaging and advertising, instead of providing quality products and good customer service...(By the way, I only brought Apple into my review because on Beats website it now states that you are to contact Apple for any help and/or information on purchases, ordering, and sales.)
They feel good in the ear and I can wear for hours. That said, 3 pairs have broken on me and I am now getting the forth repaired by Apple. They are possibly the least durable headphones that have ever existed. It is insane! Things are so bad that Apple has the  repair box now on back order!
greatest head phones if you want to be your kids hero
they are fantastic and the sound is amazing
I love this headphones man the bass awesome Thank you
The sound quality is ok, but none of the sizes seem to fit my ear. I tried my best to use all 4 sizes, but they keep sliding off. If I keep my head absolutely still they will stay on, but as soon as I look left or right, or as soon as I start chewing on something (moving my jaw) they pop out. I guess my skin is too slippery, or my ear is different somehow..? :-P
I will stop supporting Beats they are the worst, I hate it so much! My friend gifted it to me as a birthday gift! Thanks to him! I'm sorry but Beats are the worst I will tell you why!The plastic so cheap and not a good plastic quality too!They need to work more with the cable!The sound not very bad but a lot of bass! I mean there is more than bass! What about a little clear sounds!I think it's better for Hip-Hop fans! If you are a pop or what ever don't buy it!I don't think they care about the sounds and quality of the headphones as they care about the money!I will wait for the new BOSE to change this bad headphones!No more for me BEATS!
They sound fantastic and they even work with the kindle fire hd

Great sound and actually fit my small ears comfortably.
My purpose - I wear (wore) the urBeats to work every day but not for exercising.Sound quality - Great (though I'm no audiophile)Portability - GreatDurability - God awful.  I received these earbuds as a gift less than a year ago and I'm already on my 2nd replacement pair.Price - a bit steep given the durability!Customer service - not great -> no easy way to process returns. You need to call them and deal with less-than-savvy customer service reps who will put you on hold every several times just to tell you that their only replacement inventory consists of pink earbuds and that you'll need to call them back again at another time. (WTF mate?)I really hope Apple works out the kinks here, otherwise I'm done with this company.
On time !
This is not worth it!!!!!!!!!  I repeat, this product is NOT WORTH IT!!!!This is the most expensive earphones, I've ever bought and it was such waste of a $100!!!! They broke 13 months of use. Now, I spent a lot of money on this product so I wanted them to last. Thus, I never took them out of my house. I did not pull on the wires, twist them into a tight ball, or smash/drop them with force.  I've used them only a handful of times.  Furthermore, the warranty doesn't cover anything either!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!
I had been eye balling these little puppies since early 2013 and thought they were a good choice.  I didn't want to pay the asking price back then so I waited until I made a trip to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in Febraury 2014.  I knew from past shopping trips where to go for the best merchandise and prices.  Sure enough these Beats were available in a factory sealed box, all the included items and a warrenty card.  It was the exact same packaging I had seen at Best Buy and Walmart.  I payed only $6.00 and I do not regret it for a moment.  These in ear headphones are great, not a single thing has gone wrong and the sound quality is perfect for all the types of music I listen to.  I don't believe for a moment that these are cheap knockoffs, in Cambodia if you know where to go you get the real deal on products produced in China.
Today I received the beats urBeats headphones and when I tested them the sound is good but the control talk doesn't work. I tested with htc one x but this don't detect the headphones, also with a Samsung.
Best headphones ever. I would definitely recommend and they are pink too, which is my favorite color. I really love them.
I specifically wanted the exact headphones as posted in the picture due to the cable type as its tangle free. The one I receieved is the older version, which the cable becomes tangled.
I love them only they need some bud that can be change cause comes with only one but great item ..the song is pure quality
I got these for my birthday 10 days later they went out this Is the worst thing I have ever spent my money on. They need to make a better product. Walmart brand head phones are better than these. Why because at least the last more than 10 days
Great
Got these for my son. Says "hands down" the sound quality rocks compared to lesser priced earbuds. He loves them.
I am a 23+ year radio veteran--so I KNOW what good audio sounds like. There is NOTHING that will get me to believe the beats headphones are even remotely worth the outrageous price they cost. I've worn several and owned a pair, too. Were they good? Yes...b-u-u-u-t my Sony MDR 7506's sound BETTER and they are one-third the price. I've heard ALL the arguments, TRUST me. I'm not gonna change my mind. Period.However, I was mildly impressed with the urBeats earbuds by Dre. The sound really was pretty good. But let me also say this: I have a pair of Sony earbuds that I paid a whopping $20 on that I would say sounds 95% as good--and can out-do the beats in one very crucial area: they actually stay in my ear while exercising. I really would've kept them if they had managed to just stay put. I can't seem to figure out exactly why they kept coming out, either. Style wise they are remarkably similar in shape to the Sony's, but darned if they just didn't keep falling out and I found myself about ever half-mile being forced to reach up and push them back into place. Sorry, but that alone was a deal breaker. Now--I WILL say this: I won't suggest that all urBeats will act the same for each person. They may fit your ear like a glove and provide you with remarkably great sound for years. All I can say is if they cannot stay put, I've simply got to move on to something else.I was sufficiently impressed however that I just may take a gamble and buy a pair of their sport earbuds...if that means anything.
This is our second set with the same issue.  Not terribly impressed.  They replaced it the first time, but I am not sure they will again.
This is our second set with the same issue.  Not terribly impressed.  They replaced it the first time, but I am not sure they will again.
There amazing. They have great base. The sound quality is not of the best. I would recommend them for everyone
The headphones I received were not as pictured. The headphones seen in the image are black with red detail, the ones I received are black with gray detail and a red cord. The buttons on them don't work either. Very disappointed.
The pic is wrong; I received the older generation of the earbuds..... Not sure if I should return.. The earbuds work but just not the one shown .
They broke within a month and for some reasons thew year warranty didn't work for me. customer service through this company sucks. As a dj, let me tell you, the quality is not that great even in sound. The worst money I've ever spent. Way too expensive for a cheap pair of headphones..
I bought these ear buds to better hear the audiobooks I listen to while exercising at the gym.I still have to turn the volume up to the max to hear the book but when listening to music the ear buds are excellent.I probably need buds that offer noise cancellation but these will do for now.
Very disappointed didn't even last me a week. I couldn't do any physical activities with them. The wire had to be in a specific position for them to work
While the quality of these headphones are good and seem to work fine after about an hour or so they are in fact a knock off they are shipped in a pouch not a box and they have an ibeats form factor with urbeats paint on the top and ships with a urbeats case the first picture is accurate of the product not the last five or so but i do repeat these ARE NOT GENUINE AS PROMISED
The buds have decent sound but the volume controller is cheap plastic and the cover has already broken off.  Should have asked for a refund but didn't want to go through the hassle.
Wonderful sound and the bass is awesome. I would tell others about this. i would refer a friend to you .
I purchased these because I heard rave reviews about the sound quality.  When compared to my cheap gym earbuds for $20 they sound almost exactly the same. I tested them next to each other, 6 times with 3 different songs. Same.If you are looking for loud sound quality these are not the ones.  At most they offer a deeper base tone but thats not what I am looking for.  I am returning,
I am now on my 2nd pair because the original pair quit working about 6 months after I purchased them. I was given a replacement pair from Beats and now that pair has done the same thing. Both sets have had the same issue. One of the earbuds no longer has sound coming out of it. I take good care of these and its not like I use them 24/7. I did not expect to have this much trouble out of these considering the price they charge. These are no different than the $20 ones at walmart or target.
Bottom line, the quality of the headphones are great. Looks and sounds fantastic, but if your shopping around for headphones to use for active activities, like jogging, lifting etc..., i suggest getting something else. Here's the problem. They made these headphones very durable and heavy, so even with the lightest jog, you'll find yourself shoving the earpiece constantly back in your ear to have it not fall out. Annoying to say the least, but they sound great! Hope this post helped you out.
They're pink what else could you ask for:). I've been looking for these but didn't want to pay a high price. I love that they come with their own case and different sizes for your ears. I wear them more than I thought I would. Perfect for running they don't fall out.
I got the blue pair, and these earbuds are just pretty. I've had a kinda bad experience with Beats products, due to questionable build quality and overpowering bass with their headphones. Being small earbuds, these do not suffer from that issue, because they are much more limited in the output they can exude. They are very durable for buds; most are built with cheap plastic, but these have some chrome with them.Bass is still quite prominent, but mids and highs are more noticeable. Vocal quality is decent, and that's why these don't get a 5. That and the price, because I cannot justify spending 100 bucks on buds. I only buy beats products on big discounts, which is what I did here.
I bought them for my husband and he is very happy with them.  We would purchase them again when needed
The sound is perfection compared to any other in ear headphones. I have bought several for family members as well.
I gotta it today! Im from Chinese, so I wait for a long time! However,I like it! It beautiful! 总的来说其实也是不错的产品。
I got these headphones for Christmas and used them occasionally for work but nothing that would cause it to stop working. After approximately 3 months the left headphone started skipping out and the controls stopped working too. 3 days later the right headphone started doing the same. Definite wiring issues by the input jack. Don't waste your money.Buy the bose in-ear. The only reason I got beats was because I lost my bose and even then the beats were a gift. I would never spend my own money on this crap.And if you do decide to buy it, KEEP YOUR RECEIPT! Beats has a 1 year warranty on product deficiencies.
I've had these headphones for about a week now and as far as I can tell they are great. I've seen a lot of negativity about these and that initially worried me.The packaging was really good and they came with a nice leather carrying case. Upon first use I was stunned by the clarity and deep bass I was getting. I took these out for a test run and went for a 2 mile jog. There was never any discomfort with these and they remained in my ears throughout the jog.I will come back and update in a few months to see if these are still holing up to how I expect them too.
Tricky fitting as I happen to have dodgy ear canals but the bass response is awesome.The WOW factor wore off soon as I am pretty used to good headphone as an audiophile
I received my upbeats as a gift for christmas - I wasn't expecting much out of them, given Beats' reputation for having some pretty mediocre products, but boy do these hit the bass hard. Good, can-kicking bass is hard to achieve in any in-ear headphone, due to the fact there are no "cans," but I feel like Dre knocked these out of the park. Though definitely targeted at hip-hop in specific, these headphones actually have some nice musical range and like I said, the bass is pretty impressive. One of the few cons I have about these headphones, is the earbud cones. I feel like not a single one of the provided rubber ear cones fits perfectly. Close, but just off in some way (though I'm very satisfied there were options). The packaging was sophisticated and phenomenal, and the carrying case is INCREDIBLY convenient - especially because I was used to coiling the apple EarPods before! Overall, great earphones, some pretty awesome sound quality (not so much for acoustic and classical though) and some killer street style! I would recommend to any avid music listener and anyone who wants a sturdy pair that is reliable and fairly priced!
These urBeats in-ear Headphone are great. The sound is fantastic and it has just enough bass. I wouldrecommend these to anyone. Another thing is great about them they are tangle free,which really helps,when you have them in you pocket or purse. Thank you so much.
I choose a 3 rating because the product did not last very long before it didn't work any longer (Purchased in Nov. for Christmas and by February they weren't working any longer.  I had read other review prior to purchasing them which mentioned problems with duration of use, but it is what my grandson wanted more than anything else.  With that said, I will say that amazonreplaced the non-functioning buds.  Since it was a gift for my grandson, age 16, I do not know how the new ones are working out.  I will assume no news is good news as 16 year old boys are not heavy on conversation with grandmas.
I get it on december 6, 2013, but now it already broke.it just have a better voice quality but it's easy to have a problem
I have had to have beats/amazon replace these headphones 3 different times. One of the phones shorts out after about 3 months each time. The sound is great but it doesn't last. Luckily they've replaced them without much of a hassle but it's a pain to go through all this.
I lightly used these for just 5 weeks (maybe 20 hours of listening total) and the right earbud is already dead. I've had $5 earbuds that lasted longer than this. What a joke. Never buying this brand again.Update: It turns out they make you pay for shipping when you return their defective product. Wow.
I've only had these ear buds for 3 days so I don't know if they're durable but so far so good. The sound is incredible, much better than my cheapo $5 ear buds. There's a 3D quality to the sound and it is noticeably clearer and crisper in sound. I got these ear buds as a free gift from buying a smartphone but they have made a fan out of me (was skeptical before about high end sound stuff). Try them and its hard to go back to regular ones.EDIT: after two months one of the speakers has died. Changing the rating from 5 stars to 1.
I am so pleased to have gotten these,they are just the coolest. The  incredible sound quality and comfort of usage, worth the cost.
Right headphone died right after the return period ended.It was great up until it broke, good sound, good at blocking out external noises.
one ear bud went  out....no sound. Well i thought they would last longer...other then that your services were excellent...thank u.
These arrived with a broken piece, we thought we'd fixed it.  The broken piece seemed to remain broken--we were given a refund :-)My son used his b-day $ to buy these and was incredibly disappointed by the fact they were shipped this way.  Wondering if these were previously owned ?
Sound quality is great (as expected), but for some reason the volume control doesn't work with my Samsung Galaxy S4.
Love 'em! They 're the best headphones ever! Great color pink which is my favorite and designed by the Queen Nicki! Thank u!
Beats are like heart beats. Without them, you cannot have a feeling of sound. Once again the perfect colour for my sweet sister. I gifted her and she liked it.
I bought these guys over Christmas and I am an avid user/abuser of ear buds.  I got tired of the hype and decided to invest a hundred bucks and see for myself what all the hooey was about.  I'd read a couple of reviews that raised some quality concerns but overall approached the purchase positively.  I promised myself I would wait a few months to review just to make sure I presented an educated opinion so…five months later, here goes....I live in the windy city and spend Goode deal of time commuting via public transportation plus I work out so my ears spend the majority of their time with buds plugged into them.  I've spent the same amount of money as Urbeats on brands like Bose and Skull Candy and Sennheiser and my complaints are always the same,  first.  the little rubber ear things are never securely fastened and always fall off forcing you to find replacements or to buy a new set.  Secondly, the sound quality generally doesn’t rival over-the-ear headphones and thirdly, because mine take a lot of abuse, they have short lifespans.  Well, I’m happy to report that I can't make one of these complaints about my Urbeats.  The quality is very good.  The flat rubber cord makes these feel like the Bentley of ear buds and the solid construction of the speakers are able to take a decent beating.  Second, the sounds quality is, for an in-ear very very impressive with deep base resonance that at times requires me to turn it down via an equalizer setting.  Finally and most important (for me), the rubber earpieces, while removable to clean, are so securely fastened to the speaker unit that its virtually impossible to lose them.  These ear buds are AMAZING.  Anyone who lives for a well-fitting quality ear bud should be forced to try these.  Their price is high but completely worth it and they come packaged in such a way that they make an impressive gift as well.  If, like me, you’ve been up and down the aisles of Best Buy looking at earbuds and have been, overall, disappointed in your purchases, I beg you to give these a whirl.  They are worth it.
These are awesome.  Love the size, quality of construction, price and just overall very very happy. Buy these for sure.
The box came allRipped and was afraid they were used.  They were hard to stay in the ears at first.  Then was able to get them to stay.
Great Sound but unfortunately they short out just as easily as any cheap pair. For the price I hoped the technology would be better.
Had nice sound and nice bass but the right earbud no sound within a month of purchase should have better durability for something you paid $100
what you pay in extra money is certainly worth it for the excellent quality of sound you get. I dread the idea of ever losing them.
great product, fantastic packaging, slick design ...however did not deliver. sadly disappointed - after one use the left ear piece died. sadly this product is not a monster beat ...but rather a dead beat.
Just to clarify, I bought these exact ones at my local target. Also, I am not an audiophile.These are amazing. They have very good clarity. The highs, lows, and mids were all very crisp and clean. The sound keeps the signature beats signature. If you do not like a LOT of bass, these might not be the ones for you. For me however, I enjoy the beats bass sound. The build quality is also very good. It is a matte aluminum with red accents(I have the black and red). If you don't put them through vigorous conditions, they should be fine. The look is just sexy. I love the contrast between black and red, so these headphones looked really good to me. Overall, these are very good and sturdy. However is you dont like a lot of bass, you might want to look at some other earbuds.
I love my new erbuds.  each one fits so well in each ear and stays in place, so comfortable  pleased
Seller says product has never been worn, I don't know about that, but they have been opened. They are not sealed nor in original packaging. Doesn't come with the replacement earbuds, I had to buy them because the ones it comes with are too big and headphones kept falling off. Seller did answer my messages right away.
do not buy these just because they say beats. they had okay sound quality the 3 months i had them till one side of the headphones broke. the tangle free cable isn't tangle free, the earbuds get screeched and they all around suck.
I really like these earbuds, but they WON'T STAY in my ears. They have great sound quality, comparable to the Solo headphones; but they keep falling out of my ears, especially my left one. I thought it was just me that had this issue until I read other reviews. I'm torn, I love they sound if they could stay in my ears for more than five minutes. I LOVE THE SOUND, not the fit....
The plastic sound control thing fell off after the first week....but the rest are fine. Sound quality is pretty good.
These were bought as a christmas gift and were used for 1 month and broke right away and they won't even return them because you only have a month to return...DOn't buy unless you get a plan to protect them.
MY SON LOVED THESE BUDS he almost nvere takes them off so I know this was ag reat purchase for him
After about a week remote control didn't work it.Make sure if you like this kind of headphones before you buy it.I mean the headphones are not confortamble in the ears, as good as from apple.
I am a student and I love this earphone. It's light and it looks osm and I love the sound quality. I recommend this to everyone.P.S. the only bad part is that the metal part sometimes hits your ears, but all you got to do is adjust it
Got this for my 13 year old daughter's birthday.She is totally happy as it works great with her ipad which is also pink, and she is s big nicki minaj fan too !
Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and the one stopped working after 2 months.  Very disappointed....especially for the price I had to pay for these.
I don't get any of the negative reviews. I don't see how you can get any better sound out of pair of in-ear headphones. My dad sent me a review from a 3rd party site that raved about the base and how no other in ear sounds like these. I hesitated when I saw some of the bad reviews here. Then, a friend wanted a pair to buy for a long flight back from states to the UK and LOVED them. He told me I had to buy one! Since I wanted a smaller pair for use as a phone call headset also (I also have a different brand over-ear headphone set), I just went ahead and bought them.. My 14 year old loved them so much, she also bought a pair! I then had a friend buy them and she loves them..Four for four.. Really good stuff!
Very unhappy. My daughter got them for her birthday on 2/13.  Shortly after one of the speakers stopped working. They cost eddy to much$$$ for this to happen.
AMAZING SOUND!!! TRULY WORTH THE MONEY!!i deff recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing set of earbuds that sound and look good!
The bass on these headphones is absolutely amazing, but the distortion of the sound spectrum required to achieve it can easily ruin a song. With the MP3 player on shuffle, I am amazed by the earbuds for ten minutes, and then yanking them from my ears when another song is mutated beyond recognition by something missing in the mid - treble range (and I mean, these headphones can nearly remove an entire guitar riff from a song). The bass is always flawless, so I hope they find a way to fix these things in a generation or two.
Great product....Beats headphones beat out Bose... By far in design and durability and sound. Would buy again. Fast shipment and great product.
UrBeats have a pretty long profile - enough that they constantly fall out of my ear canals due to nothing more than gravity. The sound they produce changes with each millimeter they're in your ear; if they're pushed in all the way you'll get super deep bass, but if they move out even slightly you'll end up with nothing but tinny highs. There doesn't seem to be any midrange.The volume/pause/track skip remote is located way up on the cord, so you can't actually see it. You'll be blindly reaching for it with your right hand along the left side of your neck. The pause/skip button is quite small and located between the + and - buttons, so it's easy to turn your volume up and down by mistake while trying to pause your music. It's flat-out impossible if you're wearing winter gloves; it's just too small.The rubberized tangle-free cord works well, but tends to bunch up on itself. Not having to unknot it every time I pull it from my pocket is definitely nice, though.At $100, they're insanely expensive for what you get. A pair of $20 Sony in-ear buds are more comfortable in the ear, have a remote at chest level (where you can actually see it), and sound pretty decent for the price. Granted, they're not going to have the super deep bass the urBeats produce, but if you're not a fan of having to push them deep into your ears constantly to get them to sound right, you might be better off saving your money.
I bought this and when I got this it is quite good. However, after a short period of using this headphones in different PCs, I found the right part does not work. Probably, I will not trust the US made as before.
Bought my urBeats @Target because my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Couldn't wait...read all the Good & Bad reviews...I must say that "the good outweighs the bad." The sound is on point...the best  earbuds I bought by far...the Dr. Delivered and Target hit the bullseye with a two year warranty for just $7.00 extra...that left my mind at rest...I'm confident that I will be "A HAPPIER MUSIC LISTENER!" Without Static. "Music is the soul of the man." Marvin Gaye
I order this for my son and so I haven't had any problems. Would recommend. The color is nice and the quality is the same as if you bought it off the real beats website.
It's amazing, I don't believe it has a 3.5 Rating. These in-ear headphones are truly amazing, and I've been using them for  long time.
The headphones sound awesome with the heavy bass. Perfect for listening to hip hop and also the vocals are nice and clear !
Great sound.  Need to experiment with the ear buds.  I fall somewhere in between but I am very happy with the head phones
This item worked fine until about two weeks ago, when the first headphone went out. I usually just twisted the wire to make both work, then the other one went out. All around piece of s*** headphones, save yourself some money and forget buying these
Purchased for my teenager. He loves them uses all the time. Comes in very handy in every way. Comes with a bag too.
1st pair arrived with a bump in the wire that turned into an exposed wire within two days of use.  The replacement for those actually shocked my ears!  It was the craziest sensation, luckily I was on my iPhone when it happened and I am sure that the voltage isn't too high.  The first time I felt the shock I was a bit confused, and I think it might have knocked some common sense out of me because I left them on and it happened not once more but maybe 3 more times.  Now I am returning them and no matter how great they sound I am sticking with my iPhone headphones.  Two pairs with two separate issues in a week... not going for a third pair.
I purchased these on a whim. Started using them and loved the sound but within two weeks, pulling them out of the case the wire pulls out of the mic/volume control button. I immediately contact customer service and they tell me they won't replace them due to the issue occurring from normal wear and tear. This is after I produced several photos of the earphones being in good condition except for the cord separation.I cannot believe my $100 headphones come with such poor quality and customer service!
The sounds are great on this earpiece! I could literally feel the bass beating in my ear...The same music sounds flat on all the other earpieces that I have. Noise cancellation works well too. No regrets.
I purchased these for my daughter and she is very happy, says the sound is excellent.  I am glad I purchased these from amazon.
They sound really great, especially with pop music. I love the color, too. They are the perfect pink - not too light and not too bright. And they are very comfortable!
I have had beats before but unfortunantly my kids got ahold of them. The perform just as expected definantly worth it!
I love them they sound great and there my favorite color.  They make your music like its never sound before.
Very nice quality sound and does a nice job reducing outside noise. It is also very durable so it should last the kid a lot longer then the cheap ones we have been buying.
So expensive and I used it for 2 month and the left side doesn't work.I'll never buy it again.sorry beats
Have not seen these come out of my daughters ears since arrival which should say alot. They are very good quality and sound great too.
I was so exited for this product thinking I wouldn't have to replace it for a long time. When it arrived I was pleased with the quality of sound, but then I realized that this was NOT COMPATIBLE with my Samsung S3 phone. Every time I had to answer a call I had to take the earphones out. Then less than 2 months later the right ear is out. This was certainly not worth the money, I've had cheaper headphones last me a whole year before breaking. Not happy at all with this product.
what you pay in extra money is certainly worth it for the excellent quality of sound you get. I dread the idea of ever losing them.

The sound is awesome, the build quality is not. I have done a RMA and those broke even faster the the original pair. Only got about a month or two of use then the buds start cutting out. Stay away and get some other more durable earbuds. I am not even going to bother with another RMA, I am just throwing them in the trash.
rip off shocks thru my ear and my warranty is over just started using them never again yous took my money these must be imitation
I was attracted by this color, and the discount.The earphone is perfect, the color is lovely pink, and the sound performance is perfect!
These headphones were not properly reconditioned.  Microphone never worked properly and speakers failed after 30 days.  Bought them for son as a Christmas present, so warranty expired before the speakers failed.  First and only time I have had a problem with reconditioned products so I assume that this company did not properly recondition and test this product before the sold them to me.
I like the quality of the earphones but the remote came to me slightly damaged. I can only pause/play the song the other buttons don't work. But overall, great earphones.
The in-line mic makes this a decent product for daily usage, Sound quality isn't up to par for the price.  There is a good amount of bass as is consistent with the Beats brand, but this comes at the cost of having a somewhat undetailed and artificial sound.  As an example of a direct comparison, I was listening to 'The Chain' by Fleetwood Mac off of an uncompressed WAV file from a laptop computer and decided to switch to my Ultimate Ears UE700 (now discontinued).  The drum solo lead-in to the song sounded flat and artificial on the Beats earphones while listening to the same track with the UE700 restored the life to the music.  I found the difference to be quite clear even listening off of a laptop.
I really wanted these so I used my $50 gift card towards these and got them for $39.95 . I really don't think they're worth $99.00.  I tried all the different earbuds but they still fall out if moving around. If you're planning on using them to run or workout the power beats are probably a better choice. The sound is ok and the mic is handy but too far up. Overall I like them because I mostly plan to use them when on the bus or train & the apple earbuds fall out too so maybe it's my ears.
These are the BEST headphones ever and I mean it.  Totaling worth the price!!!! The are so clear and sound wonderful.
These have amazing sound and bass and they are a great deal considering they are normally more expensive get these
this earpud is very good, im not experiencing any problems with it.this is the best earpud for daily use.
Love these headphones. I had the iBeats before but I definitely like these ones better because of the tangle resistant cords. It is very stylish without compromising the sound quality.
These headphones as I said before are amazing, definitely worth spending the extra money for them. the sound quality is unbelievable for earbuds
These earbuds are definitely worth the money. I was hesitant about buying them for Christmas, but after listening with them I would have to say they were worth the extra expense. Absolutely amazing sound!
I love these headphones, they're exactly what I was expecting I wanted beats audio but I didn't want the ugly over the ear headphones.. I wanted ones I could easily throw in my pocket and that sounded amazing. These are amazing and I love Nicki Minaj. I got them super cheap. I recommend them!
These where purchased as a gift for my teenager and he says they're awesome and that the sound is great!
For my first purchase I was really impressed. The shipping was fast and my item was in the orginal packaging which I really liked. Everything looked the way it was advertised and it turned out being a great present.
I have been enjoying the headphones, however, the metal outers seems like a cutting into my ear. It just feels like it, nothing is cut on my ear but it is not the most comfortable set of earbuds because of this. The sound on them is amazing with great highs, mids and bass. Would be much better fit with an angle earbud or softer outer casing.
The sound and clarity is excellent. In addition, they have a very stylish look without looking cheaply. It was a Christmas gift and tge recipient loves them.
Brought for my daughter she love's them. They sound great. The price with delivery actually came out cheaper and I was surprised.
Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves them. I haven't been able to use them yet so they must be good...
I bought many earphones for my music but they always break, the music was low and ugly so I bought this and I'm a happy guy. I use them on my way to work and it just makes my day. love them!!!!
Bought these for my college aged daughter who loves them.  She really likes the sound and felt it was significatly better than what she had (which were much cheaper)
Awesome design with even better sound.  One of the best features of these earbuds is their noise cancelling ability which is rarely mentioned.  Deep sounds and you look great.  Way to go Dre.
The sound quality is good but the wire is too heavy and the ear beats fall out of your ears. They may be good if you sit still on a plane or something but,they fall out when your walking. I tried all the different ear pieces and to no avail uughh! They buy these.
This headset is worth the money, the quality of sound is remarkable and I would definitely purchase this product again.
Purchased two sets of the urBeats because it seemed like such a steal! These were given as gifts, and both kids loved receiving these. They say the sound is excellent for an earbud.
I bought these for my daughter and she was very happy with her gift.  She loves the sound but says she has to get use to the fit in her ears...initially not that comfortable. However, she is very impressed with the sound!
We bought for our daughter because she didn't want over the head ear phones and she loves them! They are cute and good quality.
These never tangle and I love them. Great volume control and includes matching earbud covers as well as a carrying case. I will be purchasing a purple pair very soon.
My granddaughter loves it. There is nothing to indicate that it's Nicki Minaj, except for the color pink, but she loves it anyway.
Its great... just so beautiful :) I never had the head phones before.. they come with extra ear pieces and u can wear them for ling hours and for jogging they really stay on
I have been through 3 of these. The toggle is not built well and after 4-5 months (on average as this is my third one) it stops allowing you to change songs and people I talk to say my voice fades and eventually they could not hear me. The sound is great when it did work, but definitely NOT worth the price and bad quality.With a solid brand name they don't have strong quality to back it up.
These earphones are a little more expensive, but its worth it. The sound is so clear and they block out the outside noise.I love these and would recomend them!!
Bought as a Christmas gift for my younger sister, a connoisseur of all things Beats. These were the perfect addition to her collection. Great sound quality as to be expected with all Beats products. Fast shipping.
I am speechless how amazing these are.  Best earbuds I have.Amazing bass and sound quality.  At LEAST 20 times better than my old ones.  Blocks out 90% of outside sounds.  I was so excited when I came home from shchi land saw a box on my porch. Best EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:) :).  # Amazing
I like them. They are better than the skull candy buds I currently own, however, I guess I was expecting an oh wow moment . Overall pretty good, but as an avid music lover I am saving for Bose buds.
Provided everything that the description promised and the sound was absolutely incredible.  Highly recommend for all ages.  Especially liked the fit inside the ear
Great headphone, but worked for 2 month only! Now is all garbage! The left phone stopped work.Don't buy it!
Great product. Sound quality can't be beat. Bought as gift but tried them out and own other beats headphones that perform the same.
I did not know that Dre and Monster split. My old ones were Dre from Monster and I loved it. It was time to get new ones and picked these up. Sound quality was terrible.  Bass was weak and highs weren't crisp. I found out that the companies has split. I returned the Beats to the store and decided to try Monster. The sound quality was like the old Beats and cheaper.  I will never again pay for over priced garbage. Bad move Dre.
My 26 year old loves these headphones. They have great sound quality and are concealable. My son was very happy with his gift.
Sounds amazing, came just as promised, I have no arguments about these earphones. also came in packaging with everything. Pretty much brand new
My daughter has been wanting a pair of these for some time now, so I ordered her a pair for Christmas. She is very happy with this item. The price was very reasonable compared to other places.
Beats ur Beats in ear headphones were purchased as a gift for college student. Must have been a great item because they were stolen 9 days after he got them.
These come out my ears pretty frequently. I tired a ton of different combos of the inner ear piece and the fit still isn't great. Plus it gets visibillly dirty... For obvious reasons
My daughter loves them!!  it was a good Christmas present from dear ol dad to his baby girl. Oh yeah
This Christmas gift for my step-son, he loves! I know these Beats will have many hours of use & will be thoroughly enjoyed.
Fits my needs. Great sound quality produced by the earphone. Easy to carry around. This is my first beats product and its purpose is very well achieved.
i got these on sale, ~$70 so i figured i would go for it. ive had a pair of senheisers that i liked more, but i left those in a bar. love the tangle-free cord. also they come in colors now
Powerful, lightweight, compact, pleasing to the eye, and  with handy packaging to keep my earphones safe whilst I'm on the move.
i was pretty scared buying a used product and for more then 50% off of stock price but i ended up getting them in four days and theyre legit and work fine :D
Yes these things are the best headphones, sound wise, that I have ever had.  However, the fact that I have tried all the ear buds and these things pop out when I turn my head is HORRIBLE.  As long as I stay still they stay in, but if you are active and wearing these, be prepared to continually push them in.  They are supposed to have a tight fit.  I read the owner's manual, I followed directions, I tried all the different sizes and they just won't stay in my ears.  Maybe I have funny shaped ears, I don't know, but these things will NOT stay in my ear.  I may have to end up getting the solo beats or something else that doesn't stick in my ear.  So disappointed.
These are great, the in-line volumn control is wonderful.  I got these for a Christmas present, and they love them.
such good sound! it felt like the music was deep inside my brain and  I was living in a concert and my entire life was a music video! oh my gosh I love them they are so fancy too!!! AHHH good quality music is SO worth the price.
Sound is perfect espically the song another bites the dust! (By queen) Love the color it is perfect sound is off the chain ! Pros: Perfect color, amazing sound for a pair of buds) strong and don't tangle.  Con's: When you move the song moves slower and if you turn the jack it sounds werid ( with my phone wonder if its my phone?.)With my phone they make a buzzing sound and when I move the song kind of slows down voice control doesn't work and all this sudden the song starts to play regular it kicks in gear and plays like it never happened but it did. Sounds really  great ( amazing )! so I use my phone volume and that works. But what is weird that never happens with my Nexus ?! Besides that these are a good pair of ear buds got these on black Friday for 90$ worth it even if you pay 100$ .Really Good ear buds totally should get won't regert get these &enjoy a new way of listening! Works amazing with my Pandora account!
This was a fast delivery.  Good product...could be a little better fit for small-holed ears.  Overall, pleased with the Beats earbuds.
They are the best earphones that I have ever purchased.  The quality of music that comes threw is excellent.Wonderful....
Apparently its no coincidence that these earbuds stop working after just 3 months.  Same thing happened to me.I sent them back under warranty.  Now I will have to wait a month to get another pair-- which will probably stop working after another few months.
Got this as a Christmas present and fell in love at first sight. Not only is this product beautiful but its very sturdy and durable. Not only does it look awesome but the sound quality is simply amazing, unlike anything I've ever used.I Highly recommend this.
Bought myself a lil stocking stuffer forChristmas!!! LOVE THEM!! WouldTrade them for anything!!! Now I have a 13 year old who thinks he needs them :)
I've been sceptical about the advertised sound of beats for a while but NEEDED a pair of ear-bud headphones since my 8 year old dell headphones (still going strong) has finally developed a kink in the wires and I love my music.  I bought these and upon receiving them was impressed by the box the item came in.  I turned off all signal processing and equalizers on my phone and upon firing them up to, I was impressed by the richness of the sound and the deep bass.
Although the ear buds had good sound to begin with, after only a few days the left bud did not work, leaving only the right to produce sound.  The return went very smooth, and I was refunded my money immediately upon receipt of the earbuds. I would not recommend this product, as I have ordered 3 pairs now, and all three have had a defective left ear but.
Was worth considering purchase but maybe not $100 it is a good product and beats it self is the best brand of headphones you can get with out considering the price. People talk about how much these have but to me im not seeing it all but also everyone is different the only thing is that you have to be carful with these don't just rap around your phone and put them in your packet try to put them in a place where thy may have more room like a bag also the only other thing is that you have trouble keeping them in as I did but nothing to bad and also if they are to bass filled for you try swiching the ear tips the larger ones seem to give me more bass while the smaller lighter ones seem less bass filled all in all worth buying if you have to money and nothing eles is on your mind that you would like for purchase
I bought this as a gift. He said it was the best gift he received. I listened to these, and the sounds really is awesome. Very crisp and clear. If into headphones, these are top notch.
My son received these for Christmas and loves them!  I never see them without them.....Product is well made and great quality!
I heard instruments on songs I've been listening too for a while for the first time.  The sound quality is excellent.  The bass is deep and thumping.  I recommend this product as a starter head set.  Then one can go to the more expensive, over the ear headphones.  I also love the red color.  Beats makes you feel cool.
If it wasn't for the warranty I wouldn't be using these anymore. First pair purchased December 2012. May 2013 they stopped working, it was something internal. Beats Customer Support replaced them. I had to pay shipping and waited almost 2 months for the replacement. Replacement Beats stopped working December 2013. Again, some wire issue inside the headphones, so they were replaced. This time for FREE shipping and expedited delivery back to me. Now I'm on the third pair... let's see how long these last. Yes sound is good and they look cool but there should be no issue with these headphones lasting longer than 6 months. I use them a few times a week, an hour at a time. My dollar store headphones have outlived 2 pairs of Beats and I use the dollar store brand more! Beats are a ooorly made product! Don't waste your money.
Love them.  Everyone in my family have a pair.  Glad that I held out, I think I got the best.  Would recommend.  Love the headphones!!
Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves them. I haven't been able to use them yet so they must be good...
These were a reasonable price and shipped super quickly. They have a warranty and have good sound quality if you know someone that does not want the larger headphones
These headphones are expensive, but really well loved.If you can afford them, the sound quality is great. l would recommend these.
My daughter just brought it to me.  The package is so well designed and nicely done.  I tried immediately and fell in love with it.  I have a BOSS QC15 but often need something lighter when I am on road.  This will serve the purpose.  Hope this will last for a while.
This is the 2nd pair of Beats headphones I've bought like this, and the 3rd pair I've had that has busted. I'm not particularly tough on my headphones, but have now had 3 pair just stop working suddenly - without doing anything to them. There is a year warranty, but that only covers one replacement pair - which means after you pay for shipping and go through the hassle of getting a new pair, if that one breaks within the year purchase, then you're out of luck. After I bought my first pair, the replacement pair went out and I had to buy another one. I stupidly hoped this was a fluke - and since the sound is pretty good for earbud headphones, I bought another one. Now that the third pair has gone out, I'm going to stay away and would recommend anyone else do the same. For this price, these should be a lot sturdier - I carry mine in a hard case, am not rough with them at all - but these must be cheaply made. DON'T BUY!!
These earphones are a complete waste of money! I only had these earphones for less than 2 months and the left earbud has already gone out. The sound was pretty good at first but now they are crap. I feel like i have been ripped off buying these. Please save your money and buy a more reliable and cheaper pair of earphones.
I love these! Great sound quality and the fact that it has a mic so I can talk on my phone with them is great!
My 14 year old son purchased this product and within 3 month the left speaker stopped working, luckily we had the receipt and was able to exchange them for another pair. Another 3 months later the left speaker stopped working in the 2nd pair.  The sound is great for the time that they work.  Would definitely NOT recommend and would never let my son waste his money on these again!
A nice package all in all, but the quality is terrible. And I'm not a critic either. When I listened to them the first time they worked fine. Then after that I get static, it connects/disconnects frequently, and the hands free device worked one time when i i answered my phone with them on
Item was as described.my daughter loves them thank you very much.item was brand new in box just as described. Perfect
The price was right...it's Beats so how can you go wrong. Kids love Beats. Purchased for my daughter who is very pleased.
Awful. You are paying for a logo and that's it. I bout a pair in June and they stopped working in August. They were under warranty so they sent me another pair. Guess what? Those stopped working after about two months. I've contacted them to see how we can get that resolved - I'm hoping they just give me a refund instead of another lousy pair.I decided to spend a lot of money on a pair of headphones because I thought expensive=quality. I was tired of having earphones stop working after a year. But I owned two pairs of Beats by Dre earphones and neither of them made it past three months. I was the victim of some savvy marketing.
I was excited for my pair of UrBeats by Dr. Dre to arrive.  I worked hard for these and finally I could get my hands on them.  I had ordered two just because I wanted 2 pairs of good earbuds for my birthday.  When they arrived I noticed the amazing packaging.  The UrBeats came in better packaging than most headphones come in.  The UrBeats came with the manual and warranty (warranty is s***).  The UrBeats came with the earbuds, extra different size ear tips, and came with a carrying pouch.  I was floored by the improvement of these earbuds over my earpods.  I could hear better sound and they had better bass.  The sound was superb for about  2 months.  I would take these to school and I would use these half the time at my house.  They were my favorite pair until they blew out on 1 ear.  My black UrBeats were the first to go.  The earbuds blew out on one side and later both sides didn't work.  Then later when I was walking home I noticed that my white UrBeats weren't working from one ear either.  This caused me to be mad at the company.  Then I remembered about the warranty.  The warranty was going to save me.I was wrong.  The warranty is just a word to Beats support.  I shipped the beats to the beats store ,and then they sent me them back because I showed no proof of purchase.  I contacted them and told them what happened.  They told me to show proof of purchase then they would repair them.  Ok I thought as I was printing out my invoice from amazon.  I packaged both beats in 1 package and hoped they would repair them.  Nope they sent me them back and not even a reason why.  I was mad and decided these were not worth it.If you can stay away from these earbuds.  As you may notice like I do now look at the 1 star reviews.  Look at the pattern.  These earbuds keep blowing out after 2-3 months of small usage. If you are willing to spend $100+ plus on earbuds I would recommend some headphones or get some better earbuds.  Headphones in the $50 range could have better sound.  Believe me these earbuds don't last.  I had 2 earbuds blow out around the same time to prove it plus the other people that had the same problem as me.
Very high quality sound for ear buds. I highly recommend them. Amazing bass without highs and miss being drowned out
The blue is a little darker than I was hoping for...but otherwise, they're great.  The cord gets a little more tangled than I would have thought, given it's new flatness, but still better than the round headphone cables.
These headphones aren't sturdy. I have returned these headphones at least 3 times this past year due to loss of volume.
The earphones themselves, are great... but i don't know why the volume buttons only work on iphones. You would think since they are partnered with HTC, they would make the volume buttons compatible with the HTC one. But i digress
I ordered this pair of "urBeats In-Ear Headphones (Black)" with FLAT CABLE and red “b” logo on the earbuds sold by Kupoke, but what I got is a much cheaper model for HTC with ROUND CABLE and black “b” logo on earbuds! The Amazon customer service people was being helpful by sending me a return label, but I am abroad and Amazon is not responsible for the charges I need to pay to have it shipped back to the States, and it’s not worthwhile to pay the shipping myself and claim the refund. OK, I will swallow the loss and let it off this time. But I will NEVER EVER trust KUPOKE again! The dealer is simply OUTRAGEOUS!
Not even the same thing. instead of the picture they sent me a pair of beats which comes with HTC cellphone. no box, no intruction, no warranty, no nothing. this is a totally ripoff, if you wanna get the real thing, get it from somewhere else. This is just RIDICULOUS!
Beats Electronics includes four different-sized silicone speaker sleeves.Next, a 3.94-foot cable has a flat shape to effectively resist tangles. If you ever use in-ears while jogging, you'll love this tangle-free design. The cable also houses a handy mic and remote, and even a shirt clip. No need to reach for your device in order to skip a tune, take a call, or crank the volume—and iPhone users can even hold the main button down to activate voice commands. Unfortunately, the mic is so high up on the cable that you really can't see it at all—a minor gripe. More important is the fact that the connections aren't the most protected, so handle the cable with care.Lastly, users will also find a small carry case for the Urbeats for on-the-go protection. And speaking of on-the-go, these headphones block a considerable amount of unwanted, outside noise. High-pitched bothers like birds and neighboring conversations are 1/32 as loud. Even lower frequency sounds like dump trucks and trains can be reduced to anywhere from 1/2 to 1/4 of their original loudness. If you want the world to go away, these Urbeats can help.Bass bumpersWhen I unwrapped the Urbeats and found myself confronted with the image of an unclad lady in not but a set of headphones, I felt less than optimistic. Yet this set of in-ears entered the audio lab and emerged mostly unscathed, with favorable results across the board.
it is pretty good headphone but the adjust button for volume is not useful and the quality of headphone is testing
It is fake because the part of the ear fell apart and I can't. Try to get it back on
I liked this product but when I received it , something was missing so I returned it. Hope I ll receive my money back soon.
Great ear buds. I can no longer hear her music when she has them in. Just what my daughter wanted, and were delivered as promised!
Absolutely perfect sound quality.  Excellent value and durability. I use mine daily and on long road trips on the motorcycle. Purchased a set 8 months ago, developed a short circuit on the right side. Contacted customer support,shipped them to RMA on Sept 27, 2013 received a new set on October 2, 2013. I'm very satisfied with the product and warranty.
I was in the market for some good quality earphones for the gym but not wanting to spend a lot of money considering there for the gym. These were a perfect buy for me, not only were they they in my price range but the sound and quality of these are amazing. I have now had these for 3 months and no complains, I use them all the time in the gym and I workout five times a week..
The sound on the urBeats is incredible! The bass is extreme of course, and the clarity is good, but not great. They also have a superb design, looking really stylish and being very comfy as I can wear them for hours. They also have amazing noise cancellation. When I wear them on the loud city bus, I literally can't hear a damn thing other than my music! They have a remote and mic so you can control the music and make phone calls. The ONLY thing I criticize about these is they're extremely fragile and not as durable as they should be. I've owned 3 pairs of urBeats and none of them lasted even 3 months! They're amazing as hell, but definitely don't last long enough for 100 dollars. Perfect sound, but too fragile.Cons: Excellent sound with hard bass and a great designBad: Short lifespan, clarity could be betterEven with the most care, these probably wouldn't last more than three months. I'm on my fourth pair now, and this WILL be my last. And the sound is annoyingly flat. Good sound, but overall they're still not worth the price.
These headphones are extremely FRAGILE. I would ONLY BUY THESE WITH A PROTECTION PLAN.My first pair of in-Ear Beats were given to me as a birthday present 3 years ago. I used the brand new earbuds for 3 weeks before they wore out. They lose connection between the male piece of the headphone jack and the wire.Just last week I got this "new and improved" pair as a birthday gift. Again, they failed in the same place. I have had these headphones for 6 days and already I can hear static when the cable is not straight.I treated these headphones with great care. I always rolled them up and put them in their holder when they weren't in use. They never were hit, dropped, chewed on, spilt on, etc.I had read many reviews and none of them made clear how poorly made these headphones are. They sound fair for the price and look sexy as sin but WILL BREAK.My friend heard me talking about my issues with these headphones and informed me that he continually experiences the same problem with his headphones but because he has a protection plan he simply brings them to BestBuy and they replace them.BRITTLE, DELICATE, WEAK, CHEAPLY MADE, MARKETED WELL
i bought these on june 28 and they broke sept 17! and nothing can be done to replace the buds. I was very careful when I used my headphones. very sad that I spent 100.00 for something that doesn't last a year!!!!!
I bought these headphones used but very good was the quality. They lasted me *3Months* only and the right ear side died. I contacted the seller and wasn't compensated at all. The excuse was that there's only a thirty day warranty that I never recieved.. You can get a pair new from walmart for 30$ more and a 2 year warranty. Don't be cheap and get these *Buy New*.. You'll thank me later..
I have been searching for great earphones for ages. Tried almost every there is. My budget was about $150 so I had quite a range to choose from. Even tries the Bose ones, since I am a big fan of my Bose sound system.I wanted a small. Easy to carry. Good base. Clear vocals. Good value for turn money. Pref the non tangle cable. iPhone controller and mic. But I wanted NON IN EAR. So I couldn't get anything nice. Was frustrated.Non in ear cause a few years ago had real bad exp. but finally had to give in.I bought the Bose MIE2i. I didn't like them cause they seemed huge. It was comfortable. The cable seemed frail. But omg terrible sound. Acoustics were good. But NO BASE. NADA. I knew I'd have to expect less. But NO BASE, I can't deal with that for a $150 earphone.I bought these. Amazing. Totally satisfied. Does all of above. Super clear vocals. INSANE Bass. Some issues as listed below. But that no prob with in ear I just don't push it totally in my ear. Just leave it very lightly. But it doesn't fall off. Seals off great. And no issues of vacuum generation or ear canal irritation.Cons. Mids are lacking. Marginally amped up treble. But I have still given it full stars causs hey I can't compare to to the sound coming out of my Bose home theater. That would be unfair cause of the price difference.I was surprised that the base DOES NOT over power the vocals. That's usually the case with cheaper or bass intensive brands.I am very particular about sound but not there yet where I can spend like an audiophile. So love them. Seriously had ignored beats range as a gimmick. But oh I was so wrong.
I bought a pair of these about just under a year ago from hmv, i had them insured, the pair i have now, is actually my 5th pair due to them always breaking, usually just the sound in one ear being drastically louder than the other, the sound quality is amazing, i definitely don't look forward to finding a pair of equal quality, but ear phones should be built to last more than a year at least, it's even advertised that these beats are "built to last" however i am not the best when it comes to looking after anything in general, so i can't really say they're that bad, i could've taken more care with them, i would say, if you like good quality, and can look after them, they're a great choice got mine in near January and they're best thing i've bought this year
Very good time shopping experience. Headset is very good, sound quality is very good, very convenient to use the phone.
I use these head phone with my smart phone and their really good to listen to music.I have an expense pair of over the ear beats but I can't use them all the time. Greatstuff.
My grandson thinks they're great!! These were replacements for a pair of urBeats that came apart and we didn't know how to get them repaired.
Bass makes long listening sessions difficult. May be more to the liking of younger listeners. Doesn't fit my music choice.
They came fast perfect condition. Bought for a gift and my wife loves them they sound great  she's happy so am I.
I've had this headphones for almost 6 months, the metallic paint came off in spots around the headphones. The sound quality is good and it supports a high volume without compromising the sound, the bass is very good but the mid and lower ends can be improved. I had trouble with the left ear bud since it didn't stay in place. The major downfall is the plug, since is so stiff compared to the cable, after using it for 6 months I accidentally fatigued the internal cables so much that the connection with the left speaker was cut, I should have protected it better but I didn't expected this problem.
The urBeats In-Ear Headphone [White] where ordered NEW through Amazon.com LLC. Given to me for my birthday on the 11th of September. Today it is the 10/26/2013 and they have stopped working. I am soooooo disappointed in this product.......I have been HAD!!!. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS DEALER.......YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE DEVIL!!!!. If the seller is reading this review I would more then happy to be given my full refund and I will then take down this review. Thankyou!
These are, without contest, the worst pair of earbuds I have ever owned. I, by default, don't like Beats. Never liked the design, never liked the marketing. But I figured, eh, I'll try these little earbuds. Dropped a hundred bucks on 'em, and was actually kind of excited when they came in the mail. I put them in and walked around listening to music.Total number of times readjusting the earbuds while moving for 5 minutes: 34Total number of times readjusting the earbuds while standing still for 1 minute: 9The sound is not even close to remarkable. I'm something of an audiophile (Audioengine/Sennheiser/Yamaha owner), but second to sound comes the comfort. Urbeats failed at both of these things, more than anything has ever failed in the history of ever.Beats would be wise in putting these back on the market for $2. That is how much I'd pay for these earbuds. Two. Dollars.THEY SUCK. Period.
If you can: GET THESE AT BEST BUY AND GET THE STORE'S TWO YEAR WARRANTY (usually $20).January 2013 - PurchasedApril 2013 - Left earbud out. used warranty and got a new pair on the spot in store.June 2013 - Left earbud out again. used warranty to get a new pair.July 2013 - today. EXACTLY ONE MONTH LATER LEFT EARBUD is out!!!! I decided to look up reviews on these headphones because this is insane. turns out this is a common problem. Taking them to best buy today. Really glad I got that warranty. Will never buy Monster products again.
Excellent Sound. Nice Feel and Appearance. Crisp and Clear Sound. Nice Bass. Would hate for something to happen to them.
Great sound, easy to use and seem very durable compared to most ear buds on the market.  Not fond of the color I bought, but they work great
Its my hobby to try out different headphones and test them out. Mostly i just return them all but its all part of my search for the perfect headphones. Ive always read bad things about these and the reviews are right. These are without a doubt the worst sounding headphones i have ever tested. yes there is a tonnnnnn of bass but its not good bass. its muddy as hell and the clarity of the mids and highs is nearly non existent. DO NOT BUY THESE! i have also tried the monster branded N-Ergy ear buds....and they are a thousand times better than these for half the price. I think they go for 60 bucks at walmart. Obviously these URBEATS are just a fashion statement...and i have to admit that they look really cool, but thats the only good thing i can say. If you are dead set on monster brand go with the N-Ergy. They aren't endorsed by dr dre but trust me you get so much better sound quality. I am a music producer so i could go on and on about what is lacking in these beats by dre headphones but its not worth it. Just trust me and don't buy them! Cheers!
I had Shure E2c which finally broke. For reasons beyond the scope of this review had to urgently buy earphones and in the nearest store: Walmart had these. Usage : 7 days. Construction quality: Very solid. Packaging: Very good.Sound quality: As with any +$50 earphones, I ignored day-0 sound and used my music device at high for 24 hrs at almost full volume with these earphones plugged in, to complete the break-in. I have a special sound track which I feel very appropriate for break in of earphones/speakers. From the 3rd. to 7th. day I listened daily avg 3 hrs. The bass is extremely heavy muting considerably almost 50% of all other music. Tonality of voice, small nuances like clicks of tongue, a sharp intake of breath by singer - totally absent. Mid-levels are non existent. Treble is there but overshadowed by horribly enhanced bass. My music device is in flat equalizer settings with no bass/dolby enhancements. The sound is neither bright nor warm. It's flat with the clear feeling that its suffering from undue modulation of bass. Strain to hear after sometime. Sound isolation is good, but nothing comparable to Shure E2c/E3c...Effectively, this product is exactly same as any other off-the-shelf $15 products available everywhere. At this price point, I would seriously consider instead Shure 215 or Eytomics products. I do not recommend buying it.
Overall, these headphones are reasonably well-balanced although they have a bit too much upper bass that makes them less neutral. However, mileage (bass) will vary according how well they  fit your ears and provide a tight seal.
As a long time fan of Dr. Dre's Beats collection by Monster, I never thought I would ever expect to experience any flaws or other issues with any of the headphones I've owned from Beats But UrBeats by Dr. Dre had to be one of the overall In-Ear headphones available from the collection to have encountered issues with. Now I don't know how bad the other In-Ear ones since I've never owned a pair of them but I heard they were dreadful and that UrBeats were actually way better than the others in comparison. So I bought a white pair of UrBeats in January and I was impressed by them at first and I loved them. I loved the bass it gave, the unique design, the power it gave to cancel noise, the rich sound it gave, and the compatibility with the HTC One X's Beats Studio. However, my amusment and enjoyment of my Beats ended after approxiamtely after 2 months of use when the remote began to fail (what a great suprise from a $100 pair of headphones, right?) and it doesn't end there either because after a week or so the left speaker blew. Now to spend $100 like that on headphones, you would expect for them to be worth it but in reality, UrBeats are cheaply made headphones who embarrassingly lose to other competitors who's headphones cost way less. I returned them to the store where I purchased them and they were happy enough to replace me with a second pair, I was happy to give them a second chance. The second pair lasted me 3 months, which was a new record, and I then thought that they maybe will actually last as long as my Beats Solo HD, which I've owned for 3 years, but that thought came to a short end when the right side of the headphone became quieter than the left side. This was the last straw for them, I'm not bothering to get them replaced but instead I'm going to try the Bose MIED2I as I hope that they will be better. If you plan to buy these heaphones, please buy them here for a cheaper price than paying $100 because honestly, they aren't worth it. Just because they have the Beats brand doesn't automatically mean they are great headphones, remember at the end of the day you are just paying for the name. There are Sony headphones cheaper than these that sound just as great as UrBeats. Be wise with your money and choices! To conclude, I was not impressed by the durability of my UrBeats and I'm upset that I have to leave them for the MIED2I but it wasn't their fault that Monster constructed them cheaply with a delicate jack just to rip off people for their brand's name. I hope they make the future models with improved durability and pricier construction that actually makes them worth $100.
I usually don't write reviews but I'll make an exception. Ive had to have these headphones repaired twice and Ive had them since January. Every 2-3 months either one or both of the earbuds gives out and it appears to be an issue with the headphone jack. I baby these headphones and yet they always stop working in the same time range. Don't get me wrong Beats customer service is great and they are more than willing to set up a repair but the whole process takes 3-4 weeks and I have to pay for shipping even though its a manufacturer defect. I love the sound quality and they are great when they work, but I would not recommend this product because they constantly break.Buyer Beware!
My girlfriend bought me these earbuds for our anniversary.  They were great... for two months until they completely stopped working.  First it was the control on the wire that stopped working and then the earbuds altogether stopped producing sound.  They are NOT worth the money.  You are paying for the brand, not the quality.  When my girlfriend returned them, the workers told her that Beats break all the time.  For the love of god don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
Sounded great for 2 months then the left earbud shorted out.  I'm a 55 plus year old female and did not use these as a young person would.  Learned my lesson...will shop in a store from now on.
Don't listen to the people who keep saying that the earphones don't work well. Quality is amazing, looks amazing and simply BEAUTIFUL*UPDATE*Since September 2013 I have been using these earphones. They still sound great, no wear and tear and none of the paint has gone. I am lucky to have a pear that work as a lot of people don't. February 2014
Loved the soundMy favorite ONLY earphones I would use2 months later customers cannot make out what I'm saying on the Mic2 days after that the cord fraysI have $19 headphones that are more resilient
Its a really nice box with little pouches, but for my birthday I got a pair of urBeats and a pair of Skullcandy Inks. They looked and sounded exactly the same, minus the fancy packaging. Complete waste of money.
The price you pay for this product is not worth what you receive in return from these headphones. The warranty does not cover anything that basically happens with these headphones. You are screwed once these headphones break. I brought my headphones in late April by August the headphones completely stopped working. No sound in the right ear bud. Then no sound in the left ear bud. The warranty does not cover a blown speaker in the ear bud. You are basically paying for the name that is on the headphones. Sound is good but quality and warranty is absurd.
i got the headphones on june 28 and now on august 24 the left side headphone just stopped working . first and last time buy a dre beats product. do yourself a favor and buy something else.
Pros:Great sound qualityDon't tangle easilyCons:Scratch up very easilyBreak easilyLose small parts easilyBud casing way to rugged for wire which stresses the wire out until the wire gives out.
urBeats In-Ear Headphones (Black)With all the "Beats Hype" I thought I would take the plunge and give these ear-buds a chance.  I use ear-buds a great deal as my job involves flying coast-to coast 3-4 times a month.  To be fair, I am also a hard-core audiophile and know great sound when I hear it.  In the past I have used Shure, Nuforce NE-700X, and Sony earbuds with various degrees of satisfaction.  These urBeats earbuds are easily at the BOTTOM of the pack.Fundamentally, these ear-buds are what I feared, heavy bass emphasis, mediocre midrange, and muffled, muddy highs.  Shocking to me at this price point.  Bottom line, it is what it looks like, if you are a serious listener, pass this one by......
They have a size that is so comfortable that I can sleep in them. The sound quality is great and they are small enough.
Soooo I got the nicki minaj version of these headphones they're super cute and very girly. I use to own the heartbeats by lady gaga, those were my first beats product and those compared to these are so much better and very well improved. They're light, they stay in your ear, & sound is impeccable. A lot of people say that they stopped working after a few weeks. I just got em today so if whenever they go out I'll definitely delete this review and write another one LOL. The only thing I thought a little negative towards was that the cable looking a little china cheap, BUT then again the nicki version is barbie pink so of course they may look a little cheapy. All in all I definitely recommend this product.
They last a couple of month not long then right side goes out the you will have to fix the audio jack
Beats Urbeats are probably some of the best in-ear earbuds on the market.  They look great, they're Beats (hey, like Apple, Beats is a brand that is instantly recognizable) & for their size (& the price range) they really are topnotch.  For the first time with earbuds I've been able to hear the low end bass that was much lacking from many other earbuds I've owned.  Sure, they don't stand up to the power of the Beats Studios I have, but they're terrific for people on-the-go because, let's face it, despite how sexy Studios are sometimes going on a walk or run with them isn't necessarily the best option.  Overall, Urbeats are worth the high $99 price tag for earbuds & I recommend them.
First I want to say, these ear buds are AMAZING! I've had them for around 4 months now and have had absolutely no troubles with them. Also, the durability...its crazy! Earlier, I smacked them on them on my counter to show off. But the main point of interest would be the sound quality. So, I have owned many sets of ear buds and nothing has come close to these. Both the clarity and the bass are amazing! I actually haven't turned them up anymore than 17/30 on my HTC Windows Phone 8x. So they are plenty loud.Pros: Amazing sound, good durability, has the controls on the cord, compatible with many devices as far as the control buttons go, and are overall worth the price!Cons: Of course, they're ear buds, so they don't fit all ear sizes, but my ears are pretty large and I hardly have trouble, plus they come with three sized of buds, so there shouldn't be much trouble there.Overall these are great ear buds and I would recommend them to anybody looking for a good set of ear buds. Definitely worth $100!
I've always loved beats, and I got these to replace my old pair when they broke after 2 years. Good sound - wouldn't go as far as to say they're not grossly overpriced, but they're good.
I was excited to get the in ur beats headphones they have good sound but they do not stay in the ear long they constantly come out of my ears when listening to music. I contacted the manufacturer and got no response and contacted customer service on amazon and they did not send me a new pair. I wish I had a better story to write, if customer service is reading this someone  help solve my problem
I could not go back to regular cheap headphones.....huge difference and definitely worth the money.  It was a great buy.
I use these for hours on end each day and some times fall asleep with them in my ears. The sound quality is there but the customer service and build quality is not. I honestly think that if you want the name of dre you will get them and be happy until they fail on you. My cord is starting to fray and have static come through the earbuds. Monster said it was my fault and not covered by warranty, like they said with my other beats I own. If you need a bang around set go with skull candy. The back end service is not there for monster and is one of the worst costumer services out there I have dealt with. I hope no one else will have my problem and i look like an idiot for posting this but i'm let down again by monster after putting out a crap load of money for one of their products. in the end i guess shame on me.
Its an awesome chocie but the picture is wrong from the item your buying just to let you know. I would go with these than from the Tours or the iBeats
This product is absolutely one of my favorites because it has a very good sound and wonderful effects that went above my expectations. Also, the base is great and the sound quality is wonderful. Therefore, anyone who loves music you would need to get these right away.
I wanted to get a trendy but useful gift for my niece's 14th birthday.  The Beats brand is hot hot right now, and she is always plugged into her devices, so I thought these would be a hit, and I was right.  She loves them, and they cancel out her parents' speaking to her and her brother's chatter - both of which she sees as a definite advantages.
Bought these for my son for Xmas - he loved the sound.  One side stopped working after about 2 months.  Read the reviews before I bought them but everything I want to buy always has good reviews and bad reviews.  Seemed like enough good ones but i think they're from people who hadn't had them very long.  At any rate, as many others mentioned, one side went out.  Sending in for replacement - hopefully those will last a little longer though it will cost me for shipping.  Good sound but not worth the price for such a short time!
Unfortunately, UrBeats fell short of adequate. I was extremely disappointed in this set of in-ear headphones. When I first bought it, the presentation was extremely impressive. However, the product itself did not live up to the hype or my expectations. I like to listen to reggae and the Urbeats headphones couldn't handle the bass. Any low tone in the melody would scatter and it sounded like tin cans banging on each other. The in-ear headphones that came with my iPhone had better quality. I'm a bit confused about the rave reviews on here. I guess if you're going from a $20 skull candy in-ear phones to this, then yes, I hope Urbeats is better. However, for someone who is used to Bose in-ear headphones, like me, Urbeats can barely make subpar.
Unless you have all extremely high-quality audio on your device, you will be disappointed in the quality of the sound from these earbuds. I recommend spending about half on another set unless everything you will be listening to is studio quality.
Stupid cat, always eatin my stuff. Already had a pair of these, dont really like how they fit for long periods of time but I liked them enough to buy them again. The sound is phenomenal, I ride my motorcycle with them and they're ridiculously noise canceling that I have to wear them with one in and one out so I can hear other traffic.
These earphones might be a little pricy but the bass is incredible and they look great and they are durable.
I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY FIANCE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY IN NOVEMBER, WE HAD TO SEND THE FIRST PAIR BACK BECAUSE ONE OF THE EARBUDS WENT OUT AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND NOW THE SECOND PAIR ARE BROKEN. THE EARBUD IS NO LONGER ATTACHED TO THE WIRE,IT JUS DECIDED TO COME LOOSE I GUESS AND THE WARRANTY ON THESE HEAD PHONES DOESNT REALLY COVER ANYTHING BUT DEFECT ON INSIDE, NOTHING ON THE OUTSIDE.
Great buy! Love these. Definitely recommend this product to my friends and to all of amazon shoppers. I just bought them and so far-so good! I will be sure to update my review if anything changes.
The product was sent in a very excellent condition. I really like them. I recommend them to other people who are going to buy these they are very good quality
Beats any in ear buds that I have ever used. The sound is really, really great, I would recommend this product..
I got this to go with my HP laptop with beats, great quality (sound and physical), the cord never tangles
First off, I didn't buy this on Amazon. I bought this from Target with a two year warranty for $9 bucks! Like everyone else I had trouble with earphones always spending and spending on skull candy,Sony,Samsung...etc. So many have messed up,cut,one ear blew out...poorly made. I debated on buying this for $100 but I spend much more on buying earphones every week!!! I finally caved in and let me tell you this was the best purchase ever 6 months in not a single problem!!! Good bass,nicely made,nice fit I got the white and red the look is just amazing. What I don't recommend is buying online because many times I bought fake beats for $50-60 hoping I can save a few bucks. There are so many counterfeits of Dre beats so be careful! Best buy,Walmart,Target I recommend and get that 2 year warranty that $9 bucks will save you.
sounds great  but will break very easy, didn't  last the week but the sound was great. got my money back.
The headphones came just like it was described. They were packaged just like new. I didn't have any problems at all. I even received them earlier than expected as well.
My son really liked them, until one side stopped working.  Don't bother opening a ticket for service or help, they wont get back to you.  I called and they will be sending something.  The process will be 2-4 weeks IF approved!! SO dissappointed.
Everything was brand new and sealed as described on the item page. This is exactly what I wanted, thank you so much!
Blocks out most noise the beat is great for music with bass, Use them mostly at the gym or on long distance runs and its a great fit. High quality sound for lil beats. I gave it four star because I'll use these for working out, I hope they will last longer the my beats solo. This product brand is not ment for cold it will malfuntion.
They sound awesome the bass is great and they look cool and you can take them anywere I woukd recommend these
The only way to listen to personal music is with a pair of beats.  The buds are comfortable.  The white is clean and looks nice with the red b and cord.
I purchased this Earphones for my teen-aged brother for Christmas. He was happy. But then I try it - sound is excellent! Much better than I expected for this price! So I purchase another one Earphones for me.
I got these as a christmas gift and the left side just broke because it fell out of my ear when i was in the car and it hit my skatevoard i checked to see the damage because they are metal and can get marks/scratched easily:/ and now it stopped working:( but i have warranty so its all good ish
well beats are the best in my opinion, i like the heavy base, but, i already own the ibeats, and when i researched these, i was informed that the wire would be stronger and untangle-able, however i received the urbeats that where made for the HTC phone, while still amazing ear buds, they weren't exactly what i wanted, i was thinking about returning them, but that's a hassle, and i still have my ibeats, so i have my back up pair of beats and i'm happy, i just wish i had the untangle-able wire!!!!
Super design built tough made to last returned the tours they never would stay in place my ears poor design pick these up find them on amazon at a great rate.
GOT HIM A BEATS BOX AND NOW HE CAN ENJOY THE AWESOME SOUND WITHOUT INTERRUPTING OUR PROGRAMMING.  WE LOVE THESE.
Sound quality is mediocre at best.  Not much better than apple earbuds.  The packaging & presentation were the best thing about them.  Essentially, your paying $100 for a good maketing gimmick.
These headphones have a ton of BASS!  So if you want your eardrums blasted with Bass then get these.  The Vocals are decent but they could be better if the bass wasn't so heavy.  But my daughter loves the headphones, so I guess I got everything I paid for.
Don't buy these. They sound great, are comfortable but they break so easily. I've had two pairs in about 6 weeks, using them consistently every day and with both of them the right earphone shorted out and you could barely hear anything. If you're going to use these at all, they'll break and it's sad, because Ir really enjoyed them when they worked, but they just break so easily.
Got these for my daughter for a Christmas present, she has used them every day since then! She loves them!!
I just purchased these urbeats from Best Buy last night.  Took them home, was impressed by the presentation of the box, there was a case for the extra ear cushions, a carrying case, and user guide/warranty info tucked neatly on the opening flap.  I plugged these into my Galaxy Note 2, and started listening to some Dubstep.  This one song in particular: Imp Box 2011 by Tryfexta, I kept playing over and over again because the bass in it simply just blew me away.  So far so good.  I then for the heck of it, grabbed the stock earphones that came with my Note 2 that I never opened from it's plastic bag till now.  Did a switcharoo, plugged them in and WTF????  The Note 2 buds sounded exactly like the urbeats, complete with thunderous bass & all!  Only difference between the 2, I noticed that the Samsung oem's seemed wider than the beats.  Can someone else please confirm the sound sig on oem earbuds that come with the Note 2 and I think also the SGS 3?  I dont know if I should return the urbeats or just hold onto them...
Someone asked me if the Urbeats are worth the money,  I will say that sound is good,  offers some noise canceling, and is a lot better than the stock iPhone ear buds. I also like the fact that these are in ear and  am not walking around with huge headphones on when traveling through airports.They are holding up pretty good after a couple months of use,  I would tell people if you want a head phone that sounds pretty good and that you will keep for a while then get them.
These headphones feel apart completely after less than a month and a half. My daughter was really wanting these as her main Christmas present, and they are garbage now. What really upsets me is that the refund for this item is only 45 days and then you can only receive a partial refund and you have to pay for shipping both ways. Dr. Dre should hide his face in public, anyone buying these things is making a foolish mistake, foolish. Do not waste your money, I repeat, do not waste your money.
Headphones/ear buds already broke and had to send back to company to replace. Cost a  lot of money to break so quickly
Sounded great for 2 months then the left earbud shorted out.  I'm a 55 plus year old female and did not use these as a young person would.  Learned my lesson...will shop in a store from now on.
Thank you so much for the In Ear Hendphones, I really enjoy this product. It is like new and It came packed in a very well matter. Thnk you so much.
I purchased a pair of iBeats about a year ago.  The iBeats which were manufactured by Monster were an amazing pair of headphones.  1. The cable was durable and heavy. 2. The buds were heavy and had a polished metal finish.  3. The sound was crisp and powerful with slightly boosted bass that just enough but not too much.About a week ago the cable started shorting at the tip near the connector.  Every other brand I have purchased typically lasted three months before shorting while these lasted a year.  I went to exchange my iBeats today through the Protection Plan I had purchased with the buds but apparently monster and Beats by Dre parted ways and they are now being manufactured by someone else and have a new name urbeats.  The packaging looked the same, and the image on the box looked descent.  When I got home and opened the box, let me tell you what I took out of the box was nothing near the quality of the pair I had exchanged.These urbeats 1.  The flat wire cable is thin and feels cheap.  2. The buds are no longer heavy and shiny metal, but feel like cheap plastic, though the manufacturer's homepage says they are brushed metal.  3. They sound cheap, definitely not the crisp powerful sound delivered by the iBeats.  I really feel like they belonged more on the racks by the registers rather than with a price tag of $99.  I've purchased  $14.99 Skull Candy headphones that have a richer sound than these.  I had to double check the box that they were actually Beats by Dre and not Cheats by Dre
This is the gift for my friend. I don't know what she feels or something but i think it's a good gift to give.
Love These Earbuds. Great Sound And Quality Would Definitely Buy These Again.Highly Recommend To Everyone. The Bass Coming Out Of These Small Buds Is Insane.
I've tried every bud under the sun. I went to these after experiencing audio nirvana with the first generation.Problem is, the way these are designed (they are elongated, so they slip too far into your ears) you WILL blow out your eardrums if you listen to these over 50% on an iPhone.I hate writing negatively about these, but if you go against my warning, you'll have two options: listen to your music less than 50% and no bass or crank up to your heart's delight and lose your hearing.My ears have pounded for four months as if I was under water. The throbbing finally went away. I cannot, in good conscious, recommend these buds. If you can listen to these safely, awesome on you. But...you've been warned.
Well the ur beats from dr dre are good but over priced.Honestly I think they should only cost 60. They have good bass but my right earbud just stopped working. The earphones I do recommend is munitio earphones there better in bass and in price:)
Looks good, sounds good, and the cord doesn't tangle.Also own Atomic Flyods MiniDart with remote control but feel that urBeats is much better value.
One word: Garbage!I bought these with the allure of being able to control the music on my HTC One.Pros:  - Track Navigation does work, although laggy at times  - It's Beats, so you may get oohs and aahs from peopleBut to an audiophile --Cons:  - Bass is too much to the point of saturation  - Mid-range is not very crisp  - Treble is almost non-existantFor this price range, I would recommend the Klipsch S4A's.  Much better frequency range and clarity at a cheaper price (Controls may or may not work with the Klipsch Android App.  I haven't tested this).If you're dead-set on purchasing these, then at least pair them with a music app that has an equalizer i.e. Neutron.  Unfortunately, this doesn't even save it for me, but at least it makes the headphones sound better than stock.This link is a must-read for anyone considering purchasing earbuds in general:http://www.head-fi.org/t/478568/
I bought these earbuds as a replacement for my diddybeats & I have to say I like them better they are lighter & when it comes to earbuds in my opinion is something of an essential quality but speaking strictly these earbuds I give them 2 thumbs up

Bought these for my son for Xmas - he loved the sound.  One side stopped working after about 2 months.  Read the reviews before I bought them but everything I want to buy always has good reviews and bad reviews.  Seemed like enough good ones but i think they're from people who hadn't had them very long.  At any rate, as many others mentioned, one side went out.  Sending in for replacement - hopefully those will last a little longer though it will cost me for shipping.  Good sound but not worth the price for such a short time!
While they are pretty to look at, and sounded great at first; the overall built quality is that of a $30 ear-buds. I have never used mine for exercise (no sweat damage)and they only lasted about 6 months. First, one side got substantially quieter, month later the other and now only one ear-bud is just barely working. $100 piece of junk....stay away.
The mids are good but the bass is a complete disappointment. I'd say there is no bass at all. To do justice, I started with Dre's "Chronic 2001" only to be pissed with the highs and lows. Then I listened to Skrillex, I realized the mids were pretty good except for the bass. But for $100 I'm not going to waste my money in this mediocre s***. A $20 skullcandy earphones outputs better than this.One thing I appreciate about the earphone is the design which is definitely attractive.
The past two weeks I had been hesitant to buy these just as a buyer below had mentioned, but I figured why not, I can always return it if I didn't like it. I'm SO glad I bought it. The BASS and VOCALS are great on these earbuds and work great with music for those; however, when you get into alternative rock/rock or any genre that has a mix of instruments, the sound isn't so great. Or rather, sounds like any other cheap earbuds. I love their design, they feel very comfortable, and have great overall sound and noise cancellation. My MAIN concern is that about half of the reviews on here and other places say that these earbuds break within a few weeks so I hope they last me at least half a year. I do take care of my earbuds all the time so I'm expecting them last for awhile..I hope but I will update this review if for whatever reason they break within a few weeks. The pricing is a bit EHHH, to me. To be honest, I think a lot of the money for this product goes to the packaging and Dr. Dre. The packaging is REALLY nice...but makes you think, is this TOO nice for a $100 product? Anyways, I'm not exactly sure that these earbuds are worth $100 bucks, but for what it's worth, I don't mind spending the 100 bucks for these earbuds...just as long as they last me for a couple months at the least.Pros:*Very nice packaging.*Design/style and color are awesome! I wanted the white-red ones but I figured the white part would get dirty easily*FEELS durable, the cord I mean. Most earbuds I've used always use the thin, cylindrical cord but this one uses the flat one which makes it seem/feel more durable (I hope it really is)*Comes with a nice, durable rubber pouch to hold the buds and comes with extra buds to change sizes*Great noise cancelling*Very comfortable fit*VERY nice bass AND vocalsCons:*Cord is kind of short, wouldn't do so well when working out/jogging*I don't really like the play button or whatever it is on the cord, makes it look bulky/uneven in terms of design*Hopefully it doesn't break!
I bought these headphones today at Walmart. I was going to buy the white model but they only had the black model so I bought that. So when I went home and started listening, these were my impressions:Packaging:The packaging of the urBeats is, in my opinion, one of the best for any headphones out there. Beats by Dre really worked hard to create this packaging. It includes some manuals, one of which showcases all of their headphones that they make. Also, a nice addition is a Beats sticker to place wherever you want. For some reason, the focus on packaging reminds me of Apple, as they also supply nice packaging with stickers. They also supply different size ear tips, and a small case which I will get to in the next section. But what I'm trying to say is that they worked very hard on the packaging.Case:These headphones include a small case with Beats branding. They are like a pouch, but they include magnets on the top to keep the case shut and secure. This case also came with the previous iBeats model, but this has a lot less branding, with the iBeats' case having a Monster logo and the words "Sound Really Matters". The only bad thing about this case is that you have to try to get the buds deep inside but other than that I love this case.Design:As these are Beats headphones, you will expect great design. And it delivers on that. The earphones themselves are made of metal, and they kind of look like an in-ear version of their Mixr headphones. The cord is flat and tangle-free. I've tried to tangle these things, and 90% of the time they untangle with no problem. The cord is red, which I personally like, but if you want a lower-profile headphone, this might bother you. It also includes a remote with a built in microphone for calls. But, the volume up and down only works on select Apple products, and only the center button and mic works on Android and Blackberry devices. For some reason, my Atrix 2 won't seem to work with the remote at all, so if you own that phone, that's something to take note of.Comfort:These headphones are okay in this category, but for some reason, these headphones cause discomfort in my left ear. Of course, your mileage may vary, but it has caused pain in my left ear. (Which isn't a good thing.) But for some odd reason, my right ear comes out alright. And now we go into the world of the human ear. Not today. But, I can't say for comfort 100 percent, but your mileage may vary and if they are uncomfortable you can try the different size tips included with the headphones.Update on Comfort - 4/11/2013For some reason the urBeats fit comfortably in my left ear now. Hmm... maybe they got used to them?Sound:Bass. The Beats line of headphones are famous (or infamous) for their bass, so if you don't like bass and are planning to buy these earbuds, don't. These headphones are designed to output bass. And, unlike other Beats headphones, these don't overpower. I'm not a basshead, but I like the bass that these headphones give out. The mids and highs sound great. I have listened to rock, rap and acoustic music on these headphones, and these tackle all of them really well. Since these headphones are sponsored by rapper and record producer Dr. Dre, I listened to one of his tracks, "Forgot About Dre" on these. These headphones tackle the song very well. The bass is well defined, the vocals are clear, and everything just sounds great. I listened to other music like The White Stripes "Little Acorns" where there is just narrative in the beginning and hard guitar in the end. The headphones also take this song really well. The guitar is great and the narrative in the beginning sounds crisp, clean and clear. Acoustic music also sounds great on here. But if you are an audiophile you will not like these headphones, as these are sculpted to a specific market.The Verdict:If you like bass, and you want some good looking headphones with good sound these headphones are for you. But, if you hate bass, or if you're an audiophile, these are not going to be the headphones for you. Although the comfort may vary, I think this is a great product for the $100 selling price.
PROSThe sound qualityThe smooth heavy bassThe packagingCONSYou can't move around without having to readjust themAbout every 20-30 minutes of moving they may fall outThe wire it comes with is either too long or too short [@ gym]
I'm extremely confused as to why the reviews aren't great on this product & not just on here, but the best buy website, Amazon, Walmart and Target as well. Let me tell you- I've been thinking about these earbuds for the last few weeks and I waited for a while to purchase them to make sure that I wasn't going to waste money and hope they wouldn't disappoint. I only have one friend that I know of who has a pair of these, but he has the tours. I asked him how he felt about his and he said they were amazing. I'm actually stoked that I decided to buy them. Since there are a lot of people saying that their headphones seem to break somewhat easy, and the left bud blows out- of course I went with the warranty (actually purchased them from walmart, and got the $9 warranty) . I've had these for an hour now. The TV is on in the background and it's set at a decent volume, I know I'd definitely be able to hear it with my apple headphones on. Can't hear it even a little bit with these on. Pink Floyd just came on my iphone and it's actually fantastic. I'm hoping I never have to use the warranty but I'm very happy I got it. Also, people are out of their minds- the bass on these is actually FANTASTIC, you can actually feel it in your chest. It's way too loud turned all the way up. If you're having a moral dilemma as to whether or not you should buy them- you should buy them.

My old iBeats broke in 5 months of use, but I got urBeats as a replacement through the warranty. I love the improvements on these headphones. The wires are tangle-proof, the remote is much more heavy duty, and the bass on these things is still unbelievable for headphones so small! The bass is not overpowering, but anyone could easily tell that it is much crisper and more accurate than on the iBeats. They stay in my ears well whether I'm active or not. On a side note, the case that was included is kind of frustrating, because the metal strips (that you pinch to open and close the case) are very strong and are hard to open. Besides that, I can easily say that I'm very satisfied with these headphones. I've only owned these for a month now, but I'll be updating my review to tell how the hold up.I've owned these for over a year now, and they still hold up great! I haven't kept them pristine for sure, but they have held up to my abuse pretty well. The remote still works, cord is in good shape without any fraying even though I've strained it once or twice accidentally. Sent them through the washer and dryer on accident as well. They still work without any change in sound quality! Pretty neat little headphones, definitely would be worth your pay if you can afford them. You won't ever switch back to a cheap pair after using these. Definitely recommended.
The UrBeats aren't worth the box they come in. With a $100 price point Beats By Dre has clearly milked the marketing cow. The celebrity endorsement, high dollar advertising and expensive packaging are why these things cost $100. Don't be fooled by the premium price point, you will be happier with the audio quality of $30 pair.I purchased mine from Best Buy in November and last week the left side quit working. Defective, I called Beats customer service, thankfully they are still under warranty - 1 year. The customer service rep was very understanding and polite but that's about the only positive thing I recieved from this purchase. I actually spoke with two customers service reps and both aknowledged that this is a commom problem with this product UrBeats.I'm not neive enough to think that any consumer goods company has 100% quality control and I don't typically waste my time writing reviews, but the fact that they are positioning this brand as premium is absurd. Not only are the products not premium but neither is the customer service. I was extremely surprised that I have to pay for these defective things twice $99 the first time and now I have to send these things in, pay for shipping and pay again wiht 2-4 weeks of my time while I wait for them to replace these things. Meanwhile prime motorcycling season is underway and I will have to defer back to my old Sony ear buds.....thanks Sony for offering quality products at a fair price.
They are good when it comes to listening , but comfort isn't that focused on.They make my ears hear if I listen for a long period of time.
Edit:Great Headphone. Ripped Open Package Immediately When It Came.The EarPhones are Great and Worth the 99.95.They Sound Fantastic, Hear Stuff I Never Heard With EarPod.Note - Find the Correct Size EarBud or It Won't Sound Good-Ignore the Caps, I Like Capitalizing First Letter :P
These are the greatest earbuds out there. It comes with the nicest carry case and comes with 4 spare comfort rubbers of different sizes.
I like the sound of these headphones. I find the cord a little stiff, but overall I am happy with the performance of the headphones.
It's all it said it can do,it's just nice.The volume and sound is very good.Everyone should get 1,everyone I know want 1so I might get them 1.
They sound great, deep bass, solid pitch/treble/mids. They look great, the casing is clean, and the cord is greats.After two weeks the cord starting peeling and the left headphone stopped working.If you take perfect care of them you will be fine, but if not you will break them.
Worked really well for the first 3 weeks and then started breaking up.  We were very disappointed. :( the sound quality is fantastic......until it starts breaking up and crackling. Of course, we purchased 2 pairs and the pair that is malfunctioning is used constantly, the other pair has not been used yet.
Bought these as a gift for two of my sons.  They both love them.  I would have liked to see these in many more colors and not so expensive
I always love Beats headphones, and these are no exception. very portable and I love the flat chord. they also stay in really well when I go running.
These are great headphones. They are really well packaged. Feels heavier than you would expect. They sound great and block out background noise extremely well. I recommend them.
Sound Gooooooooooood!Design GooD!Have no regrets.Buy here next earphone.I like it.......
I ordered black and received white, granted they may have been sold out but, no one let me know. In the future it would be nice to get some warning.
my daughter loves them. we gave them to her for christmas! She has had other kinds but said there is nothing that compairs to them!
Love the sound! Can't get any better than beats! Great bass! Great quality and love the white...easier to keep track of these.
I currently have Meelectroncis M6, Ultimate Ears Superfi and V-Moda Crossfade LP.  I replaced my Superfi with the M6 because I didn't want to spend too much on headphones to work out in.  Little did I know that sweat will break IEMs not desigened for it.  $$$ lesson learned.  I'm no audiophile, but after testing out various headphones, I guess I'm 80% bass head most of the time.I bought the urBeats to pair with my HTC 8x after I plugged in a pair of my friends Beats Solos.  The difference was bass heavnly clear at a very low volume level.  I love my V-Moda cans, but the reality is for my use case, urBeats made sense with my budget and my phone.Pros:- Build quality is better than most have reported.  Cord is thin, but far from flemsy.- Tangle free cord is nice- Bass is great - I've burned them in for about 2 days and I think it made a difference.  could be just me.- Case is very useful for more than just the headphones.- Design is a major plus for me.  I like the metal and black/red color.Cons:-Price.  I wish they were more like $80, but not too bad.-Eartips supply could have been better.  M6's had at least 2 more options.  Superfi came with foam tips plus more assortment of tips.If you have a beats powered device, I'd say its worth it.  The sound just sounds different in a good way.  I know I've read users talking bad about the Beats by Dre brand, but in my case I believe it delivered.These are not recommended for the audiophile or those who don't like a lot of thump in their listening experience.  Others have reported fitting problems, and I'd say those are valid if you've never worked with IEMs before.  I'm working with finding the perfect fit and so far I'm using the triple flange tips that came with my M6 and they work great.  These IEMs are not for working out, so don't even think you can.Conclusion:  If you are a Beats fan or just like heavy bass, I'd recommend them.  Especially if you have a Beats powered device.  If you have an HTC 8x, I think its worth a look.UPDATE:  After a couple of months with these IEMs they are much better than I thought it would be.  It really depends on the source (mp3 player, smartphone, other) but in general there is a lot more to these than just plain bass.My current set up is using Sony's MW600 wireless headphone adaptor and Motorola's Motoactv watch.  The Motoactv tends to lean bass heavy on the EQ, but I think it works perfect.  I listen to a lot of R&B, and that works well with urBeats.  What was most surprising was when playing more acoustic/vocal centered music (Cannonball by Damian Rice or any Tyrone Well's songs)the vocals appear to be more up front.  I'm not an audiophile, however, I've researched enough to understand that urBeats won't have an extended sound stage, but there is sound separation.  The bass from the guitar will not over power the vocals and the highs are not bad here.  I've enjoyed my time with the urBeats and will continue to use them for my R&B/HipHop music.  I will be purchasing a paire of IEMs that have even more stage and imaging though.  Sony's XBA series looks to be my next purchase because it has warmer tones than your average armature driver (which isn't exactly flat eq)UPDATE: 11/13/2013So the durability of these IEMs are questionable.  I don't run with them and do nothing extreamly out of the ordinary.  I have stuffed them into coat pockets and regular pockets which I think could be what caused them to stop working completely on smartphones and most recently mp3 players.  Sound will not come if I use it on my HTC 8X or BB Z10.  It kind of worked with my iPod nano/iPod 4th gen, but the right bud no longer works without wiggling the cable.  I purchased these because they were advertised as durable, but that is definitely not the case here.  I've adjusted my rating from 4 to 2 stars.  They lasted almost a year, but at $99 you expect it to last far longer especially if they are being used for commuting and office scenarios.
This is the WORST headphones I have ever purchased.  They were defective right out of the box, the right ear bud arrived with a short in the cord.  I noticed that the sound was not even close to balanced between right and left so when I took out the left ear but I had No sound coming from the right.  I discovered that if I wiggled the cord I would get sound fade in and out.This is really a shame, and a sham of a product.
Gave these as a Christmas gift to my girlfriend. The audio was great but within 10 minutes of her using them the same day the left earbud & wire literally fell out from the button! $100 set of "High End" earphones and thy break that quickly?! Insane! Thankfully I kept the receipt. Never buying another pair of Beats/Monster anything, ever again.
I just bought these after I had to return my Klipsch Image S4A (which I received as a gift from a Secret Santa party) due to improper fit. These sounds ALMOST as good as the Klipsch Image S4A, however they are slightly more bass heavy. For me, noise isolation is a big deal, so the Bose IE2 wouldn't have worked. As far as proper fit, urBeats aren't a perfect fit, but they are a better fit for my ears than the S4As. The only thing that I wish Beats wouldn't changed was the bright RED colored wires...or possibly provided some more options for the colors. I just want to enjoy the music and don't want the added attention the bright colors bring. As for build quality, they seem legit for now, but time will tell.
Great jaw dropping noise never broke on me and has a great fit. I totally love this thing super comfortable and nice bass and treble. Not as nice as the tours though.
Love these. Just got them in. Not a fan of the price, but I feel like they were money well spent to make a fashion statement.
Monster (maker of these headphones) does not stand behind their warranty on headphones.  Previous pair of Beats fell apart during normal handling--I treated them like they were a newborn baby, and the earpiece literally fell into two pieces.  After contacting customer service by phone and sending them in for warranty service, part of the headphones (not all of them) was returned to me and the warranty claim was denied for "out of normal use" damage.  No other explanation was provided, and customer service on phone is completely unable to do anything--they state that the repair facility's decision is final and there's no supervisor that can do anything to fix that.  A month later, I still don't have the piece back that they kept when I sent the headphones in, and I'm out > $100 bucks.  It will be my last Monster product EVER.
I bought these for my 15 years old nephew and he loves them. He said that the sound clarity is great and there very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
I like them alot! I was expecting more bass, but the sound is awesome.. best earphones i've ever had.. & Amazon was also Awesome for getting my urBeats to me fast! All Smiles!
Skullcandy S6HSDZ-058 Hesh 2.0 with Detatchable Cable - Rastai just brought these headphones and i must say that they are ok but not the best headphones ever. the only reason why i brought these is because i am sick and tired of running through skull candy headphones so much. to me they fit well the sound is pretty good and the wire is awesome. would i recommend anybody to buy these? well if you have money like that and you want to look good then yes other than that there are soooo many better headphones out there then dre beats or monster like sol republics or the headphones by the rza or better yet the the skull candy hesh. SOL REPUBLIC Tracks Ultra On-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic (Blue)WeSC RZA Street Headphones (Black/Blue)
Got sent white urbeats, instead of the black urbeats that I purchased, even on my receipt It stated black urbeats, dissapointed
my orders from Amazon is always on time and sometimes even faster then i aspect been with Amazon for more than 7 years the best deals are here. I was told beats are the best headphone around.. You can  hear every sound as well as words to the song no matter how low or loud the volume is.. I gave this rating because they deserve it.. my son loves them he tells me every day.
Everyone who listens to these on my evo 4glte is blown away including myself. How do they fit all that bass into those little things???!!! Still overpriced in my opinion but seems to be a quality product all the same.
My order is a black one, but I got a white one...However, quality is good, so I think it's okay.
I am a headphones/earphones buff and I have to say, the new "urbeats" are by far the best earphones out there thus far. One complaint that I have always had with earphones that that earphones as a whole wouldn't stay in your ear ( except the boses' our course ). I purchased the "tours" way back and they would never stay in my ear but the sound was great. I never purchased the "ibeats" b/c there was a lot of bad reviews so I ignored them. I went on to purchase skullcandy's, there sound was great but there ear-buds had the same problem, they wouldn't stay in my ear. So, when I saw these, I thought I would give them a try. I have to say, the "urbeats" did not disappoint, the sound is great and they actually stay in my ear. I have had them for a couple of days now and I love'em. If you have $100 to throw around then I highly recommend these , if not, then I would either go with bose or skullcandy.
Ok ill admit these are amazing but i bought mine from best buy a trusted place(so i know it wasent fake)they have the best quility l.and i love bass im all about and these have it.But the bad thing is the left earphone goes out after just a few mounths.you are better of getting some other earphones (I hope this review helps)
I ordered black and received white, granted they may have been sold out but, no one let me know. In the future it would be nice to get some warning.
Fast shipping! And amazing, can't wait to give to my mom! She's going to be so happy, she has aways wanted beats!
Love the quality of these.  Love the color, hate that the microphone is on the left and none of the ear buds fit me well.  I have never had an issue with ear buds before, always found at least one set included that fit well but not these
These over priced cheap, tastelessly designed headphones are nothing more than a successful ad campaign geared toward the same generation that loves the way 128kps mp3's sound and think dancing and lip syncing are the most important thing a musical 'artist" can do on stage. Enjoy listening to your trash on these pieces of trash.Buy a pair of Sennheiser headphones and enjoy "real" music.
These headphones sound great, never knew my iPhone music could sound so good.The fit is perfect blocking out just enough outside noise. While the price might seem a little high for a pair of headphones the sound is well worth it.
I made this review after i bought these from Best Buy. it goes over the Features,durability pros and cons and if I like them. If you want to see the review click this link( [...] )
I got these earphones with my Rezound and the sound quality was amazing. I loved these and the only reason i gave these a 4 star was because they arent the toughest, not the biggest deal though. I used these very often until i lost them at school one day. Overall these earphones were great i loved them, i would definitely consider buying another pair as soon as i get $100. Also, too be honest $100 for a pair of earphones are a bit pricey dont you think?
Purchased this item on November 18, 2012. received the wrong color! Ordered "white" but got "black" Decided to over look the color issue, plugged into two different devices and every thing sounds all robotic! cant return cause i pay a ton of custom duties for importing into my country plus its going to cost almost what the item is worth in shipping to return it! feels like getting pick pocketed, now i have to go buy another sad!
I bought urbeats by Dr. dre.  for my AT&T galaxy S3 (SIII). Music worked great. I was able to successfully control play, pause, next track, previous track, volume up, volume down after I installed "Jays audio control" app from play store. However sad news is that the mic is not working.. Also these completely blocked from external noise which I was not a big fan of. The sound quality and build quality is great but these have to go back because of mic.
The sound was great!...for 2 months, then the left ear bud crapped out on me (most likely a frayed wire). Prior to this the paint managed to chip off the buds themselves. I took great care of these things, never putting a strain on the wire, never wraping them in a tight ball, and never knoting them.  I had to revert back to my $20 JVC ear buds that seem to be able to handel any kind of abuse imaginable. If you're spending this kind of money, these people have absolutly no excuse for how flimsy their product is.
I really wanted to like these headphones, the sound is great, they fit well. However the construction is BRUTAL! I have gone through two pairs in the last 4 months...The same problem both times, the left head phone (the one with the remote) began to cut out, and eventually stopped working altogether. I was very disappointed. Spend $100+ on headphones, you expect them to last more than a couple of months. Save your money. They need to improve the durability before these will be any good.

First off the sound is amazing. They sound better than any other in ear headphone I have ever heard including Bose. Bass is just right and I really like they way they have several tips so you get a great ear fit. Better than the 2-3 that come with others.Wife purchased them for my birthday so I could listen to my Ipod while riding my motorcycle. First set lasted exactly 1 year as I didn't really use them a lot. Summer comes around and I start using them and they fail in 2 months of use. I had purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy so they replace them no problem.2 months of using the new set and the left ear bud starts crackling. Take them back to Best Buy and exchange them for the Soul by Ludacris. While not quite as accurate in sonic clarity they have serious bass and so far (6 months) not a single hiccup.The other Beats headphones are wonderful, I have a pair of the studios, never gave me a problem and have had them for 2 years. But the ear buds are not durable enough for me. I guess if you sit at a desk and use them they may last you awhile but I wouldn't suggest taking them outside.
This is a pair of brand new designed white model of urBeats.When I first saw them as soon as I unwrap the package, I was fully amazed by its attractive looking. You cannot imagine these cute buds have any relations with the old model iBeats. Or, you might think iBeats are pretty designed and made with bright white plastics, you now, however, will think those can be directly thrown. What I have to say is the new wires which look like that of Beats Tour. Actually, wires of new urBeats are narrower and thinner than that of Tour. This is the biggest improvement compared with the old iBeats.When talk about the sound performance, many anti-Beats will jump out saying "Oh, well, Monster sounds good now, since Beats left." I always consider that is something like anti-apple fans doing. I would like to praise Sen's stable performance and AudioTech's cold sounding as well as Beats' balance. These new urBeats give you a new feeling than old iBeats do. The bass part sounds heavier, and the tremble part sounds outstanding than before. That makes a close step to Tour's performance, there is still a gap though. If you are pursuing an extreme listening experience with this kinda in-ear buds instead of over-ear headphones, buy Beats Tour. However, if you wanna find a pair of good sounding beautiful earbuds to replace the ones you got accompany from your iPhone, iPod, or other brands electronic devices, urBeats is a good enough choice.So, this shall be separately stocked instead of sold and commented together with old ones. The new urBeats is in every aspect a brand new model. I would give full five stars.
I'm an up and coming audiophile and when my friend told me he just got these "new beats" I had the urge to listen since so many people seem to like Beats by Dre. Replacing iBeats and still retaining the $99 price tag, I was unimpressed when I listened. Sure the housing seems more durable but for this price you'd expect a single balanced armature driver rather than a dynamic speaker. These should be price at $50 or even less, of course the rest are paid for the "b" on the side  of the earbud. What Beats should make is a dual driver earbud (lows/highs) so bass quality isn't sacrificed, but rather addressed with its own driver since I understand overwhelming bass is the selling point of Beats ear/headphones. The cable is nice, but it'd be better if it was detachable; however, that's reserved for higher-end earbuds. The colors are nice and the 'buds are very stylish for sure and possibly adequate for the 256kbps songs bought from iTunes, but if you're serious about sound quality switch to something else.
Every time I listen to a video where someone is speaking, they all of the sudden have bad grammar. This problem does not occur on any of my other headphones, only these. I believe the problem is caused by the name "urBeats", but I have yet to find a solution.
