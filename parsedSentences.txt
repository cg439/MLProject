593 *** After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.
1200 *** On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.
592 *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
344 *** It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
345 *** the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one.
346 *** the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!
347 *** pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
340 *** They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
341 *** Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09.
342 *** Bought with a credit card.
343 *** Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
348 *** i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
349 *** i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
1653 *** And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop.
512 *** He came into my house, fiddled around on the computer for a good forty minutes and got ready to leave before it was even done doing what he was doing to it.
2318 *** Wonderful zooming.
2319 *** With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.
2316 *** PDF files can be viewed instantly.
2317 *** Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.
2314 *** Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
2315 *** OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.
2312 *** It is so speedy.
2313 *** Startup in about 30 seconds, shutdown in 2-4 seconds, resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds.
2310 *** So far, I have no complaints.
2311 *** The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
298 *** I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.
299 *** Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.
296 *** Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
297 *** I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.
294 *** The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.
295 *** The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
292 *** I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.
293 *** Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
290 *** I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.
291 *** Not to mention it has shit gigs.
587 *** I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down
270 *** The Apple MC371LL/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money.
271 *** MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.
272 *** I had a MacBook Notebook, and it had absolutely no protection from viruses, spyware, malware, etc.
273 *** Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
274 *** The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.
275 *** It is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.
276 *** Files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.
277 *** The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used, and the command prompt would not work at all.
278 *** The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
279 *** The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.
2146 *** But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
581 *** I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
2268 *** without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.
2269 *** I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.
1132 *** A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.
2262 *** After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.
2263 *** This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
2260 *** The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
2261 *** The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!
2266 *** As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
2267 *** As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;
2264 *** I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.
2265 *** I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!
2442 *** Overall, still a very nice machine.
2443 *** Boots up fast and runs great!
2440 *** I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.
2441 *** They are not.
2446 *** I didn't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.
2447 *** Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
2444 *** I'm pleased.
2445 *** The acer one compuer is a great computer.
2448 *** The pictures are clear as can be.
2449 *** If I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer.
108 *** It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
109 *** Then it ceased charging at all.
102 *** The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
103 *** The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.
100 *** I had of course bought a 3 year warranty, so I sent it in to be replaced and (almost 2 months later) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement.
101 *** I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
107 *** My laptop now has no battery.
104 *** Is this partially due to the fact that it is running Windows Vista?
105 *** That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
2046 *** This computer was awful!
2047 *** I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.
2044 *** I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
2045 *** I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!
2042 *** Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
2043 *** HP didn't fix it.
2040 *** I was psyched.
2041 *** I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.
2048 *** The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.
2049 *** It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
1213 *** Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
2836 *** the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.
1210 *** returned it.
2688 *** If you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.
2689 *** I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
2684 *** Good price.
2685 *** Basic computer.
2686 *** Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
2830 *** Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.
2680 *** Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
2681 *** This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old.
2682 *** Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
2683 *** Good luck with your purchase options.
99 *** After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
98 *** It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
91 *** Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
90 *** The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
93 *** In the past few years, I've had terrible experiences with HP.
92 *** The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
94 *** Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current, up to date HP Pavilion--If I recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.
97 *** First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
1623 *** With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
1990 *** After the first few months, the computer started crashing about every week.
1993 *** Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
1620 *** I will never go back to Windows!
1627 *** I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store.
1994 *** These new problems were the final straws;
1997 *** it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.
1624 *** 2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection.
1999 *** Please, anyone who is considering getting this computer, stop.
1998 *** So, owing to these problems, I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro, which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment.
1629 *** I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the "blue screen of death".
1377 *** You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.
3013 *** The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.
2860 *** But, for the cost this is a winner.
2861 *** I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.
2862 *** I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .
2863 *** The price and features more than met my needs.
2864 *** I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.
2865 *** The feature are good enough for what I need.
2866 *** This is my second laptop,and it is head and shoulders above my first.
2867 *** It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.
555 *** It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
2869 *** I am very happy with this laptop.
557 *** the apple pro notebook will not let you down.
556 *** It's A MAC!!
551 *** What's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it doesn't keep what I put here are my aratings
550 *** The speakers on it are useless too.
553 *** I absolutely love my mac!
552 *** Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
1502 *** But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.
1199 *** I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.
1198 *** Though you get a polite person, you often don t get a solution.
1191 *** Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
1190 *** Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.
1193 *** Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.
1192 *** The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
1195 *** I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC.
1194 *** It is known as Safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.
1197 *** Finally, the biggest problem has been tech support.
1196 *** The Apple will run Internet Explorer, but at an amazingly slow rate.
1759 *** but other then that I would give this product a 4 in hafe stars.
1758 *** The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
1757 *** Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
1756 *** Many thanks, Overstock.com.
1755 *** however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.
1753 *** I do not know for sure.
1752 *** however, I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.
1751 *** Received all four in good order;
1750 *** I ordered four D620 laptops.
1177 *** Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.
1176 *** After years of using PCs, a new Mac user is basically forced to re-learn how to use a computer.
1215 *** They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
1174 *** ) I also purchased  Applecare  for $300, which is a three year extended warranty, since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two.
1173 *** (No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
1172 *** I ordered through MacMall, which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.
1171 *** I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
1170 *** Beta had better quality, but VHS became the industry standard.
1179 *** First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
1178 *** While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak, there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world.
511 *** He didn't work for sony, he was just approved to fix their crappy products.
510 *** They sent out a Sony 'Certified' technician.
513 *** He LEFT ME, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......
1284 *** Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
1287 *** It is meant to be PORTABLE.
1286 *** However, a NETBOOK will be a different story.
1281 *** I bought it during the recent Comex IT show.
1280 *** The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
1283 *** However, my girlfriend realized that the netbook's hinge is a bit loose (when you open or close the LCD).
1282 *** So it was only about 2 weeks ago.
1003 *** I'm Very disappointed in Dell.
879 *** and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
1289 *** So, I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road, hoping they can make the hinge tighter.
1288 *** We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.
514 *** The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
1579 *** It is amazing.
1578 *** I've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back.
689 *** I've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it's all about.
1001 *** But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
1573 *** It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
684 *** The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.
687 *** Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.
1570 *** company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
1577 *** A little pricey but it is well, well worth it.
1576 *** The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.
683 *** I love this little one.
1574 *** I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
623 *** *3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam.
459 *** After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
1225 *** The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.
620 *** *2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters, they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is "on the top of the stack".
627 *** Should be there by the end of the week (again...).
626 *** Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
2741 *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
1221 *** I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.
2036 *** I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
1243 *** Theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.
624 *** They claim call center is still down.
2743 *** But, I would recommend this product.
407 *** Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
1370 *** When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008, we wanted Windows XP, but were told it would cost an extra $159, so we went with Vista.
1373 *** I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users?  They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.
1372 ***   We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.
1375 *** That system is fixed.
1374 *** Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
401 *** If the number of patrons in the Apple store are any indication, HP and other PC manufacturers need to take note.
1376 *** It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.
1379 *** Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.
1378 *** Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.
1342 *** No big deal.
409 *** i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer.
2744 *** I am not happy at all with the product I purchased.
1343 *** But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.
2747 *** Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
1242 *** To list a few: They tend to get hot enough to cause 3rd degree burns, as well as ignite any flamable material if near the part that happens to heat up.
758 *** Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
2030 *** None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
1345 *** You may just lose 1 customer for now.
2749 *** Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
456 *** The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons.
506 *** With notes saying they replaced the hard drive.
457 *** All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.
1018 *** I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.
1245 *** They aren't worth the money, even though they are on the cheap side, laptop speaking.
265 *** No tutorials on the display.
379 *** I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly!
378 *** I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.
371 *** If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac!
370 *** I am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.
373 *** Heck, I like all Mac computers, but they're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through.
2038 *** Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
375 *** But, like I said before, the only reason I don't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.
374 *** Love the graphics, awesome programs (including Garageband), and really cool default background.
377 *** Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.
376 *** I can see why the have soooo much money.
403 *** First the screen goes completely out.
393 *** Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.
392 *** I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
391 *** I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners.
390 *** I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!
397 *** Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.
396 *** My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.
395 *** The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
394 *** The leather carrying case, keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse.
399 *** I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro.
398 *** Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
2309 *** I'm glad it waited, this one is great.
2308 *** The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.
2301 *** when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
2300 *** for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.
2303 *** the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
2302 *** but after i got used to it i love it.
2305 *** the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
2304 *** it has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.
2307 *** The Toshiba Net book operates very well.
2306 *** overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.
1246 *** They're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.
245 *** It is light and the battery last a very long time.
244 *** If your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.
247 *** I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it.
246 *** Very fast boot up and shut down.
241 *** I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.
240 *** Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
243 *** If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job.
242 *** My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect, unlike the PCs in our lives.
249 *** It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.
248 *** The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
2275 *** The built in camera is very useful when chatting with other techs in remote buildings on our campus.
2274 *** We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
2277 *** This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used.
2276 *** I connect a LaCie 2Big external drive via the firewire 800 interface, which is useful for Time Machine.
2271 *** We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
2270 *** A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
2273 *** WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
2272 *** We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows Server Enterprise 2003, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.
2279 *** The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
2278 *** It out performs any other laptop on the market today.
1729 *** I love this computer.
2459 *** I love it so much.
2458 *** I bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since.
2455 *** The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
2454 *** The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.
2457 *** Im very happy with this computer!
2456 *** Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.
2451 *** Im glad that it has such great features in it.
2450 *** Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone.
2453 *** Clear picture on it and everything.
2452 *** It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.
178 *** Well, they don't care a bunch.
177 *** I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am.
176 *** Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
175 *** So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.
174 *** When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
173 *** I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.
172 *** Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.
171 *** The battery gets so HOT it is scary.
170 *** The battery has never worked well.
2051 *** When calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.
2050 *** The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.
2053 *** This computer was awful, I would never recomend it to another person.

653 *** It played various games without problems and ran aero smoothly and flawlessly.
1504 *** It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
1505 *** Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.
2157 *** This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
1501 *** It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.

1115 *** Other Thoughts: I love newegg, I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable.
1968 *** Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.

1615 *** I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
1612 *** The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
1613 *** Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
1962 *** It was heavy,bulky, and hard to carry because of the size.
1963 *** The battery life was shorter than expected.

1764 *** It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.

1142 ***   And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
1143 ***   Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.
1140 ***   Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
1141 ***   It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
1146 ***   Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.
1147 *** I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.
1144 ***   Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?  Probably not ever again.

1148 *** I had never owned a Mac before;
1149 *** I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.
2967 *** I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.

693 *** I just got this laptop for college, and so far I am very happy with it.
1544 *** This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.
1545 *** I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).
696 *** I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
1543 *** I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.

762 *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
540 *** The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect.
541 *** The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.
546 *** I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop.

2969 *** The laptop was very easy to set up.

1786 *** I was waiting for this model to be released since January, and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out.
765 *** I called back to ensure that received it, they had.
414 *** I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
415 *** They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.
416 *** I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.
417 *** I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
1388 *** Don't waste their money, save it and but a mac.
411 *** Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.
412 *** taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase
413 *** I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.
1384 *** I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.
1385 *** Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
1386 *** I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
1387 *** This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.
418 *** This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.
419 *** You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast.
1382 *** I just bought this laptop 3 days ago.
1383 *** The right speaker did not work.
1947 *** I had 3 months when the ports started going out.
2438 *** You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
3042 *** Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.
368 *** It is SO much fun to play with.
369 *** I work with kids and they love making short videos on there.
366 *** Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.
367 *** I am ADDICTED to photo booth!

389 *** It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.
2190 *** I cannot even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer.
2191 *** I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay, they are in no way comparable to the Mac.
258 *** Macs are designed for the "frontal lobe challenged" people out there.
2193 *** The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people, little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector, etc.
2194 *** Well, I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC, but took the Apple to the conference.
2195 *** I was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally, it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong.
2196 *** The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary.
2197 *** Would buy 100 more of these if I could.
2198 *** I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.
2199 *** what an elegant, wonderful machine.
250 *** I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
251 *** Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
256 *** It is not even a year old yet, so I would definitely not recommend it to anyone.
257 *** Don't waste your money!
254 *** Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
255 *** There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
2200 *** I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
2201 *** I really wish I had done this years ago.
2202 *** Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.
2203 *** Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too!
2204 *** I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.
2205 *** I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop.
2206 *** Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them.
2207 *** I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.
2208 *** I especially like the backlit keyboard.
2209 *** It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.
2428 *** It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
2429 *** If that is the case for you, I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.
503 *** I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.
2420 *** They are about the same size keys.
2421 *** I am a freelance graphic artist.
2422 *** I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently.
2423 *** This machine delivers.
2424 *** It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz.
900 *** Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
2426 *** I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.
2427 *** It is a bit heavy.
2791 *** Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.
168 *** My HP is very heavy.
169 *** Not easy to carry.
164 *** I brought this laptop last friday, and originally it worked fantastic.
166 *** Returning this as soon as I get out of work
167 *** Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.
160 *** They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.
161 *** For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
162 *** / awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen...
163 *** Sorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.
2518 *** I purchased a Toshiba Satellite M60 (with harman/kardon speakers!) in December of 2005.
2519 *** It still serves me well both in business and home needs.
2514 *** If you have the money I suggest going for the i7.
2515 *** Very good quality and well made.
2516 *** Great pick for portability and affordability.
2517 *** The black model also has a very nice seamless appearance - one of the better looking notebooks I've seen.
2510 *** Waiting for the i7 was well worth it, great value for the price.
2511 *** Bigger HD, better graphics card, and a bid HD.
2512 *** There is nothing to complain about the system.
2513 *** I have used PC's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.
2734 *** Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba.
2735 *** Needs longer lasting battery, More than 1 to 2 Hrs.
2736 *** Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side, In the way of operating a mouse in small area.
2737 *** For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.
2730 *** This was the second computer and brand bought that day.
2731 *** The first one sent: Touchpad didn't work The second sent: USB didn't work The third sent: Touchpad didn't work The fourth sent: Hasn't arrived yet.
2732 *** Probably won't work either.
2738 *** Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.

678 *** and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
679 *** This computer is really fast and I'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to...

1811 *** The Mac Snow Leopard O/S is extremely easy to use, although very different than Win XP, Visa or Win7.
1812 *** The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
1813 *** Originally bought it for my wife.
1818 *** This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.
1819 *** It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
2168 *** There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.
1098 *** )only to get another "HP/Compaq" piece of crap.
671 *** This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
1609 *** It was definelty a smart move.
1608 *** Luckily, Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead I got a refund and bought a mac.
1979 *** Better stick with another brand.
1978 *** I have never had an experience like this.
1977 *** I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
1600 *** Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
1603 *** Before I got my macbook, I owned a Dell laptop.
1602 *** If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.
1973 *** Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately.
1604 *** I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.
1607 *** By week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much.
1970 *** I will not buy another one.
809 *** DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.
808 *** 3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.
803 *** It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.
802 *** its sad because their commercials are great.
801 *** Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
800 *** So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
807 *** Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.
806 *** I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.
805 *** *IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP, THIS IS NOT IT!
804 *** I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!
2848 *** I was so excited to receive the Toshiba L455 as a gift/bonus for some work I had done for a friend of mine!
2849 *** I have owned it only two months!
2846 *** It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.
2847 *** It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.
2844 *** Toshiba is a great brand, even though I haven't had it for a long time, I am very happy with it!
2845 *** I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.
2842 *** I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME!
2843 *** I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!

2841 *** think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.
909 *** Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
1775 *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
1774 *** My next laptop will also be a Mac!
1777 *** I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express.
1776 *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
1771 *** It is easy to navigate and update programs.
1770 *** It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
1773 *** I've never had problems with viruses.
1772 *** My kids have to take their PCs in once a year to have them "de-bugged".
1779 *** This is the third MacBook Pro in our family.
1778 *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
2998 *** That being said after 2 weeks of owning every time I start it up now it gives me a black screen for 5-8 seconds stating pxe-e61 media test error check cable.
1159 *** I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
1158 *** Oh, boy!
1550 *** Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
1155 *** I can't even turn it off.
1154 *** So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
1157 *** Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
1156 *** It's catatonic.
1151 *** for 2 months.
1150 *** I was so happy with my new Mac.
1153 *** my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
1152 *** Then the hard drive failed;
1552 *** Was very much worth the price i paid.
59 *** The computer runs extremely slowly, whether opening Word or My Computer.
58 *** It turned out it's not really a problem to have a Mac.
1551 *** It is easy to use and lightweight.
2999 *** not using wired lan not sure what thats about.
1553 *** Great battery, speed, display.
1101 *** Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
1555 *** I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC.
3039 *** My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.
1557 *** My house is now 100% Macbook.
1556 *** As it turns out, I just didn't know any better.
3034 *** :-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
3035 *** It works really well.
3036 *** The pricing is very competitive.
2993 *** It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
51 *** It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!
50 *** I've owned every "Pro" model Apple laptop for the last 8 years, this is BY FAR the WORST one I've ever had.
53 *** Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.
2997 *** It has everything you need to get the job done.
537 *** I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.
55 *** May be better for the occasional web surfer.
535 *** What a waste.
534 *** A seventy dollar mouse!
533 *** I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!
532 *** All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.
531 *** I did a review on it, its awesome.
54 *** Not good for a person who gets online daily.
2992 *** Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
539 *** HP said I had done the damage.
538 *** They discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.
3037 *** You will fall in love with it in no time.
1558 *** The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
3030 *** It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.
3031 *** I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
2805 *** little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
2996 *** I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
52 *** I Hate it!
536 *** I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
429 *** The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.
428 *** If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.
1399 *** the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
1398 *** although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.
421 *** So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?
420 *** I also experience the same with my MacBook Air.
423 *** Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
422 *** For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
1393 *** the mouse buttons are hard to push.
424 *** The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
427 *** I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....
426 *** This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...
530 *** Which is what I did, check out my ACER 5517!
1321 *** The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.
2183 *** In short, you could say your mac could become your best friend (no intention of replacing Rover your dog).
2182 *** They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with.
2181 *** Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.
2180 *** Two, owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone.
2187 *** Compared to similarly spec'd PCs, this machine is good value, well built and works easily right out of the box.
2186 *** Still trying to learn how to use it.
229 *** I have had several machines over the years, both for personal and business use.
2184 *** So far, a great product.
227 *** If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
226 *** I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.
225 *** Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic.
224 *** Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.
223 *** It just works flawlessly!
222 *** The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
221 *** You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
220 *** Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
2213 *** I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.
2212 *** The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.
2211 *** The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.
2210 *** It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.
2217 *** Very small and portable I've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It's better than expected.
2216 *** I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try.
2215 *** I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.
2214 *** The program came with the computer and works beautifully.
2219 *** The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
2218 *** Can't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me.
151 *** The keyboard is top notch.
150 *** It is very well built.
2439 *** I should have been more observant.
372 *** I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.
155 *** The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.
154 *** The video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice.
157 *** I realize that not every unit has this issue, but the ones that do cannot be repaired.
156 *** It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error.
2433 *** You may need to special order a bag.
2432 *** Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.
2431 *** This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
2430 *** Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
2437 *** Pay attention to the specs if you want these options.
2436 *** It also does not have bluetooth.
2435 *** I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
2434 *** It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
2687 *** It has worked fine.
2509 *** Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac, the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.
2508 *** PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote.
2507 *** PC users work in Word, while Mac users work in Pages.
2506 *** I was originally concerned that I couldn't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting, but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.
2505 *** and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online.
2504 *** Features such as the Dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.
2503 *** Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.
2502 *** I was given a Mac as a birthday present and couldn't be happier with it 3 years later.
2501 *** The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac.
2500 *** I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed.
2727 *** Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.
2726 *** Couldnt not use it.
2725 *** Sound card is limited though.
2724 *** Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.
2723 *** Graphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.
2722 *** I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.
2721 *** Will not buy another Toshiba, this is my second, not happy w/ either.
2720 *** I'm stuck w/ a broken computer.
2729 *** returned it to walmart.
2728 *** defective software.
1807 *** I can do pretty much 75% of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table.
1806 *** This little netboook is helping me get work done!
1805 *** Good for every day computing and web browsing.
1804 *** While Apple's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products, and their support is great, it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.
1803 *** My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well.
1802 *** If so, you may be having similar problems.
1801 *** (If you ever see the spinning beachball come up when you think it shouldn't, check the "Activity Monitor" app to see if the disk throughput has temporarily dropped to zero.
1800 *** Looking online, many people are having the same problem.
1809 *** I've always used PC's for work home and this is my first experience with a Mac.
1808 *** I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.
1524 *** If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
1948 *** You can't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with.
690 *** I love it!
1257 *** Hopefully Amazon will take this back.
1942 *** The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me, they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me.
1940 *** I WILL NEVER AGAIN buy another Acer, not will I buy Gateway, or eMachine as they are all from the same company.
1941 *** Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort, I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.
1946 *** That is pretty sad when they name them specifically.
1526 *** No viruses.
1944 *** They have more problems then a 1980's computer.
1945 *** The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer  usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite.
818 *** I would recommend not buying this product.
819 ***   I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
810 *** YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.
1520 *** I am very Happy!
812 *** I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
813 ***   The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
814 ***   They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
815 ***   Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
816 ***   When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
817 ***   Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
2859 *** Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.
2858 *** Like the price and operation.
1250 *** They're absolutely useless, unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall.
1622 *** I also own an HP notebook and it doesn't even come close.
2851 *** My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
2850 *** I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!
2853 *** It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
2852 *** It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
2855 *** Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
1621 *** This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it's better than ever.
2857 *** this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!
2856 *** Buyer Beware.
1490 *** It is easy to find documents, and keep them in one area.
1491 *** The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.
1492 *** The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.
1493 *** ">  iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with: easy and convenient.
1494 *** I made a photo book as a gift, on my computer, pushed "Buy" and it drew from my iTunes account and sent the book to my house, the book was of perfect quality-exactly how I had created it and looked better than I had even imagined.
1495 *** The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.
1496 *** All of the programs (Keynote, Pages, Numbers) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible, which really eliminates the need for the actual.
1396 *** i'm returning mine
1498 *** I love this laptop, and use it everyday to do something, and never lets me down.
1499 *** I have never had it crash, randomly turn off,
1395 *** do not buy you will be disappointed.
1626 *** I used to build my own desktops from the component parts, and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working (this was a rock star 7 years ago).
1700 *** HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.
1701 *** Comes with iMovie;
1702 *** Few viruses to catch;
1394 *** i cant believe HP put this out.
1704 *** I pondered very long over this decision.
1705 *** I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.
1706 *** My main reason to convert was the imovie program.
1707 *** I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
1708 *** I already own an iPhone, and so the move just made more sense.
425 *** Sad very SAD.
1996 *** I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
1392 *** sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
1391 *** the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
1390 *** Dell sucks
1128 *** Keyboard could use some trimming.
1129 *** Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
1628 *** I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.
1120 *** I hope to edit this in the next few hours, I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7.
1121 *** Sorry, newegg.
1122 *** An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.
1123 *** I just can't fathom that the celebrated Dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products - it only survives b/c its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through question-raising programs.
1124 *** Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).
1125 *** Enough said.
1126 *** The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
1127 *** The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.
2989 *** Great, quick laptop for the money.
2988 *** It's a great product for a great price!
3029 *** It's a joke.
3028 *** The "Time remaining" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.
3027 *** Enabling the battery timer is useless.
3026 *** The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
3025 *** I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.
2980 *** I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.
2987 *** It works fine with our wireless and they've had not problems.
3022 *** It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
2985 *** My daughter uses it for games, email, facebook, pictures and music.
3020 *** It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.
524 *** Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV.
525 *** Just a month and a half or two months ago, my VAIO crashed again.
526 *** It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.
527 *** I can't honestly say I was heartbroken.
520 *** My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
1019 *** Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.
522 *** Either way the entire thing was just a joke, a complete rip off!
523 *** I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
1014 *** As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy.
1015 *** The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.
1016 *** I have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed.
1017 *** Two of the times was in one month.
528 *** More relieved than anything.
529 *** Now I could get myself a cheap computer, that will probably work a whole lot better!
1012 *** I had to pay for the shipping!
1013 *** I will never buy anything from HP again!
1234 *** We don't Mind and You don't Matter.
1235 *** I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.
1236 *** When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don't matter.
1237 *** The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!
1230 *** Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.
1231 *** By Air sounds more like by truck to Me.
1232 *** And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
1233 *** The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
1238 *** Do not  buy it!
1239 *** It is the worst laptop ever
2526 *** Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
438 *** So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...
439 *** This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro.
436 *** And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
437 *** Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
434 *** I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.
435 *** They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
432 *** I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.
433 *** And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.
431 *** I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I've ever bought.
2975 *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
559 *** apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
558 *** apple is one of the best computer companies in the country.
2868 *** True quality at a great price!
554 *** I can't imagine my life without it anymore!
1960 *** All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.
1961 *** I did not like my acer.
2464 *** GREAT INVESTMENT!
3065 *** I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
994 *** I first purchased this Dell model "1764" on April 6, 201
2948 *** The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
997 *** Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
2467 *** Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.
238 *** That includes transferring my music and movies.
239 *** Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!
234 *** The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.
235 *** The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.
236 *** Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.
237 *** I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
230 *** All of them were Windows machines.
231 *** Don't get me wrong, I am no Microsoft hater, I've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine.
232 *** For me, five stars is not enough.
2461 *** The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.
3068 *** No laptop is perfect, but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you.
2462 *** It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.
2228 *** first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac.
2229 *** i asked many people, search on the net and also read reviews here in best buy.
2226 *** Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
2227 *** I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!
2224 *** I'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.
2225 *** I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
2222 *** I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
2223 *** The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
2220 *** The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
2221 *** Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
1 *** All I can say is W-O-W.
146 *** I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
147 *** The keyboard is too slick.
144 *** I thought the price was great for the specs.
145 *** But after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.
142 *** I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell (not to say Dell is that great), not with a brand new laptop.
143 *** Very very disappointed!
140 *** I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.
141 *** Called Acer many times, they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer!
2468 *** This unit is not.
148 *** I really don't like it, but I am stuck.
149 *** With all the goodies inside this machine, it is a value.
2088 *** The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
2089 *** Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.
2082 *** If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.
2083 *** It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
2080 *** Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
2081 *** I love the multi-touch trackpad.
2086 *** My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
2087 *** That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.
2084 *** If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.
2085 *** (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
2538 *** this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures.
2539 *** i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.
2532 *** The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
2533 *** It seems to be incompatible with everything else.
2530 *** It's solid.
2531 *** Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
2536 *** this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with.
2537 *** i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.
2534 *** But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
2535 *** i love to use it it is esay and light.
2712 *** This is the first laptop I've owned, althougth I used several at my previous job.
2713 *** The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
2710 *** Came fully loaded - good.
2711 *** Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
2716 *** Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
2717 *** Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
2714 *** I've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye'd the computer when I took it out of my bag.
2715 *** Took it back as it was defective.
2718 *** I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.
2719 *** Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
1832 *** I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.
1833 *** I would Highly recommend this MacBook.
1830 *** I did not take the class and wish that I would have.
1831 *** I have found a lot of online sources to help me but think that I would have learned a lot quicker if I would have taken the class.
1836 *** I'll wait and save up for a new one.
1837 *** Just don't waste your time and money on this.
1834 *** THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.
1697 *** (I definatly can't).
1838 *** I tried giving it 0 stars but I had to choose at least one, but IMO NO STARS
1839 *** The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.
2154 *** The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.
2155 *** The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you sowish.
2404 *** We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.
938 ***   Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.
2150 *** Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction, like all the others, we smoothly with no problems.
2151 *** The computer was delivered as promised.
2152 *** Will certainly use MacConnection again.
2401 *** If you're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game, you'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market.
933 ***   I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!
932 *** taking notes, research, an online class and such and didn't want to spend too much on my first machine.
931 ***   But I needed a laptop for school use.
930 ***   The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop, before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved.
937 ***   I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.
936 ***   It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
935 *** at first!
934 ***   I loved it.
1955 *** Took that one home, same thing.
1954 *** I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.
1957 *** So I got another netbook which I love!
1956 *** Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
1951 *** I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me.
1950 *** Since I never really got to use this, I can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.
1953 *** My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
1952 *** I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
1959 *** The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
1958 *** I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys.
829 ***   Stupidly, mind-numbingly slow--then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum*.
828 ***   It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.
825 ***   Will probably never buy a HP again.
824 ***   Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.
827 ***    I'm a professional consultant, and a client needed work on her machine.
826 *** This machine was a horrible experience.
821 ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
820 ***   I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
823 ***   It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
822 ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
1536 *** I am very happy I bought this Mac, well worth the extra money.
1175 *** The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2
1483 *** The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
1482 *** Just what the doctor ordered.
1481 *** It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.
1480 *** My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
1487 *** My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
1486 *** All the problems I have had with PC's are solved with a Mac: the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off, and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it, with no inexpensive way of fixing it.
1485 *** This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
1484 *** If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
1489 *** All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.
1488 *** There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.
797 *** they have not sent a new one nor called.
796 *** they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.
1711 *** I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well!
1710 *** The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.
793 *** when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
792 *** The letter A stopped working after the first week.
791 *** The computer blinks it shuts off at will.
2410 *** Mac computers automatically "defrag" each time you start your computer.
3050 *** I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed.
1719 *** This worked just fine.
1718 *** I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB.
2145 *** Laptop is to be used like a Netbook.
799 *** then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
798 *** i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.
1270 *** Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem.
2144 *** the speed is fine.
613 *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
2143 *** Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.
1272 *** It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.
2142 *** everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.
1139 ***   I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
1138 *** Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
2417 *** Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
1133 *** I got what I paid for.
616 *** -When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.
1131 *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
1130 *** After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
1137 *** IT IS TRASH!
1135 *** I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.
1134 *** I have had it 9 months and it is already a $250 loss.
2792 *** The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
614 *** -When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
2418 *** This is another reason to like the Mac.
615 *** -Estimated time to fix it: 10 working days or less.
2790 *** Recommended to people as their first laptop.
3018 *** The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
3019 *** The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
3012 *** This is my second MacBook.
2796 *** This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
3010 *** Let me start with the good:So awesome.
3011 *** Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
3016 *** I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.
3017 *** The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.
3014 *** I fell in love with it.
3015 *** This one has had the same effect.
519 *** The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
518 *** It was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.
926 *** But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
1009 *** Each time taking about 1 day or so.
1008 *** Ive had to call tech support many times.
1007 *** I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
1006 *** I'm now trying to decide on another Dell model.
1005 *** They were great in handling this problem, and I'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future.
1004 *** This is not Best Buy's fault.
515 *** They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty, and that products with  extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore.
1002 *** It was returned on the third day I owned it.
517 *** I can't even remember how I finally got it taken care of, but I was done with Sony after that!
1000 *** Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764.
1227 *** They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
622 *** -Called MacHouse Amsterdam to ask for a temporary replacement, no answer.
621 *** -Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
1224 *** I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
1223 *** I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone, but this Netbook was a very poor computer.
1222 *** I took it back for a full refund.
625 *** No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because "many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset"-Inquired status of repair.
1220 *** Needless to say, not to happy with the product.
629 *** -Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.
628 *** *4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam, decided to send complaint email to Apple.
1229 *** The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
1228 *** The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
1535 *** However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
2882 *** It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!
2883 *** I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!
2880 *** So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.
2881 *** I went with him and we picked this one.
2886 *** My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
2887 *** My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA!
2884 *** I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
2885 *** I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
2888 *** I just love this lap top, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.
2889 *** That is my only complaint!
2 *** This laptop is insane!!!
2958 *** It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.
11 *** DEFINITELY recommended!!!
10 *** Obviously, this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way.
13 *** The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
12 *** For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.
15 *** Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.
14 *** Not too much "junk" software to remove.
17 *** I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro.
16 *** A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
19 *** Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
18 *** While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
2959 *** The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.
928 *** So you out of of notebook and money.
1397 *** dell is a decently made pc.
1534 *** I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.
688 *** And Toshiba is a quality supplier.
201 *** Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level, I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop.
200 *** and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....
203 *** Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.
202 *** I am glad I did my research.
205 *** Images are crisp and clean.
204 *** The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
207 *** Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
206 *** The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.
209 *** Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.
208 *** The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.
2745 *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
685 *** I like it better than my big Dell Laptop.
1572 *** From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy.
1571 *** Very satisfied.
2239 *** After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
2238 *** and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
686 *** Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
2231 *** you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
2230 *** and finally i realized that mac is the best.
2233 *** u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.
2232 *** mac is extremely different than any other laptop.
2235 *** also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
2234 *** and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.
2237 *** also it is light weight compared to others.
2236 *** also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
1575 *** I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait.
682 *** GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!
2185 *** High price tag, however.
228 *** Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.
2095 *** I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
2094 *** I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine.
2097 *** For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
2096 *** The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
2091 *** One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.
2090 *** Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
2093 *** I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.
2092 *** I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.
2099 *** I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.
2098 *** Best Buy Rocks!
2525 *** It is everything that I would want in a computer.
2524 *** It was secure and easy to navigate.
2527 *** I would definitely not go back to using a PC after using the mac.
2188 *** I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.
2521 *** I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!
2520 *** It is, however, very heavy.
2523 *** I am totally satisfied with my little toshie!
2522 *** It meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling.
2529 *** Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.
2528 *** Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.
2709 *** Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.
2708 *** The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.
2705 *** Registration/1st use is easy.
2704 *** Its a good laptop for its value.
2707 *** Would like more trendy, high tech features.
2706 *** Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
2701 *** Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.
2700 *** Handles all my basic media needs easily.
2703 *** It's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.
2702 *** It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.
1829 *** There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.
1828 *** If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC's.
1825 *** NOT WITH APPLE.
1824 *** When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
1827 *** People know what they are talking about and they have pride in the product that they are selling.
1826 *** If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there.
1821 *** I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.
1820 *** This was my first MacBook purchase ever.
1823 *** I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year.
1822 *** My previous purchases were with Dell and HP.
2147 *** Love it.
929 *** The love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.
2413 *** The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
2412 *** It took so much time.
2415 *** The gray color was a good choice.
2414 *** The 17 inch screen is very large, but the computer is very light.
2141 *** this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
2416 *** I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.
2419 *** It is easy to go from one keyboard to another.
921 *** And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
922 *** I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR.
923 *** compresses itself and you can't use it.
924 *** NO good.
925 *** You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.
2149 *** We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
927 *** So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
2411 *** What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC!
1920 *** I was constantly having to roll back the computer after doing updates.
1921 *** Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.
1922 *** The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
1923 *** Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
1924 *** In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
1925 *** When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.
1926 *** Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.
1927 *** By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student, so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.
1928 *** After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.
1929 *** My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN.
3069 *** This laptop does everything I need it to very well.
832 ***   My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.
833 ***   Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
830 ***   There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
831 ***   The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
836 *** The AC power port becomes loose over time
837 *** falls into the case.
834 *** This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
835 *** but it  has a major design flaw.
838 *** The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.
839 *** I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
3 *** It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.
784 *** If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
785 *** I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
786 *** Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!
787 *** I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!
780 *** I purchased this laptop 9 months ago!
781 *** The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
782 *** They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
783 *** I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town.
1726 *** I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.
1727 *** The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
1724 *** I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.
1725 *** My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.
1722 *** After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
789 *** I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!
1720 *** Otherwise this little notebook has met all my expectations.
1721 *** Never any doubt I would get a MacBook, just wasn't sure which one.
153 *** The screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting.
60 *** Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem, they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I'd like to purchase more memory for $75.
61 *** What I'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.
3007 *** the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.
3006 *** lots of preloaded software.
64 *** In summary, take your money elsewhere.
3000 *** and it has blue screen crashed on me twice.
66 *** the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run.
3002 *** Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.
68 *** and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it.
69 *** I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!
3009 *** this is starting off good.
3008 *** tosiba has a good reputation, my llast computer was an acer.
1371 ***   That was a big mistake.
1588 *** This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.
1589 *** You will not regret buying such a great thing like this!
406 *** HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
1582 *** Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.
1583 *** Very happy.
1580 *** A great computer for light home use and business use.
1581 *** Might not make the avid gamer happy but I don't really think that is what this computer is designed for.
1586 *** Its still going.
1587 *** It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
1584 *** The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.
1585 *** He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.
159 *** Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
1038 *** Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.
404 *** Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
508 *** Just a black screen!
158 *** I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.
1032 *** I'm going back to DELL.
1033 *** Pretty disappointed about this product.
1030 *** Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
505 *** They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
1036 *** You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
1037 *** The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
1034 *** Good luck.
1035 *** Do your research on this issue.
1212 *** They say sorry out of warranty.
631 *** -Complied to their protocol, called number, made "case", got an email address to send complaint.
632 *** -Managed to send complaint email.
633 *** *5 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Apple offers to send replacement after they receive the old computer.
1216 *** Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
635 *** -Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer.
636 *** I respond that I do not have the old computer...
637 *** -I propose that they can just swap the hard drives.
638 *** They refuse.
639 *** -I propose that I can just swap the hard drives.
1218 *** Summary: Dont buy HP.
1219 *** If you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.
465 *** They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.
2899 *** I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day.
1728 *** If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.
2895 *** It's super fast and a great value for the price!
2894 *** The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
2897 *** One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase.
2896 *** I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.
2891 *** WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!
2890 *** LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
2893 *** I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back.
2892 *** I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.
1106 *** It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
1107 *** I was said it's videocard.
1456 ***   i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely immoble.
1105 *** After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
1102 *** Posted Nov 8, 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook.
1451 *** i have had my dell latitude for almost three years.
1100 ***   So, buyers beware!
1453 ***   luckly i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.
408 *** I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
1458 ***   the battery is irreplaceable.
1459 ***   i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
464 *** They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.
1109 *** Didn't expect to repair it at once!
788 *** Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late!
1723 *** The performance is awesome.
681 *** MACS ARE AMAZING!!!
680 *** I've only had mine a day but I'm already used to it...
2136 *** i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.
2137 *** i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
3070 *** I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;
3071 *** the two of us use it regularly.
216 *** The Macbook is a fantastic laptop.
217 *** This is the first macbook I have ever had.
214 *** Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.
215 *** I like it!
212 *** Small and light weight.
213 *** Speakers too small to be of any real use.
210 *** If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the MBPs.
211 *** I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for.
218 *** I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.
219 *** The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
2138 *** With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.
2139 *** this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.
462 *** Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
4 *** I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :)
1976 *** Which was way too much money.
2550 *** The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
3005 *** I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!
2552 *** My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $300 less (he got a pc).
2553 *** He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
2554 *** We both recently got new laptops.
2555 *** We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
2556 *** My Macbook was worth (after 3 years of use!) $375.
2557 *** His was worth $36.
2558 *** We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
2559 *** Obviously we both got new Macs.
62 *** They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.
2396 *** Perfect trifecta!
2397 *** I would recommend this product.
2394 *** I don't really have a complaint.
2395 *** It is easy to use, good quality and good price.
2392 *** Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
2393 *** I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
2390 *** Speakers don't get that loud, but good enough.
2391 *** Consumer Report recommended Toshiba.
3001 *** What a great little laptop.
2398 *** I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;
2399 *** she can't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system.
2778 *** The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.
2779 *** Overall for the money this is a good deal.
3003 *** I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.
2770 *** Those things are very important - vital even!
2771 *** So think about factoring those things in when you purchase.
2772 *** I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.
2773 *** I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection.
2774 *** Thank you.
2775 *** Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.
2776 *** My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
2777 *** Great wifi too.
1858 *** The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
1859 *** Otherwise, I love it!
1850 *** After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.
1851 ***   After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.
1852 ***   After that the said it was under warranty.
1853 ***   Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.
1854 *** After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
1855 ***   I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
1856 *** They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
1857 *** I bought this netbook for traveling, and it's great - light, functional, and meets my needs.
2172 *** The computer is a dream come true.
2173 *** With all the programs that came with it, such as iLife and iWork, I was set from the very beginning.
2170 *** Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
2171 *** I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
2176 *** I am so happy to have purchased this computer.
2177 *** Once you go Mac, you can't go back!
2174 *** Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
2175 *** I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.
915 *** A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
914 ***  A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
917 ***  One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
916 ***  Went silently.
911 *** no complaints with their desktop, and maybe because it just sits on your desktop, and you don't carry it around, which could jar the hard drive, or the motherboard.
910 *** And it is impossible to get them back in.
913 ***  A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
912 *** Bought this gateway M-50 or 150 early 2007.
2604 *** It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze, and organizing them by place, time taken, or sending them to an online print shop, or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc, is not hard at all.
2605 *** The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
2606 *** I would recommend Mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.
2607 *** There is nothing better.
2600 *** After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years, I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.
2601 *** It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact, and I am certainly glad I did.
516 *** Apparently they're not special anymore .
2603 *** I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.
2608 *** Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.
2609 *** I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
1933 *** I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.
1932 *** So not having my laptop was discouraging.
1931 *** So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.
1930 *** After about another month I had to send it in AGAIN to Acer for repairs.
1937 *** I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
1936 *** In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
1935 *** Again, I sent it off to Acer, by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything, but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance.
1934 *** Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN.
1939 *** This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products.
1938 *** I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks.
458 *** In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
847 *** I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this  laptop.
846 *** I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3  months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).
845 *** Long story, but after many calls to various  offices, I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers  don't take phone calls or e/mails.
844 *** I  asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches, dents  or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of  damage could happen.
843 *** The "abuse" is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.
842 *** I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
841 *** 99 to  fix it.
840 *** It has happened again and I'm being told that it's $175.
849 *** The bottom-line is that this laptop just isn't worth it.
848 *** How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.
2406 *** The 17 in Macbook Pro has been a wonderful addition.
663 *** So don't get it.
2407 *** You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely cannot be without.
1739 *** Design: very durable.
1738 *** I just plug this into my 22" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.
1731 *** Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.
1730 *** Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.
1733 *** Games being the main issue.
1732 *** The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
1735 *** I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be.
1734 *** It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
1737 *** It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made.
1736 *** Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!
1039 *** Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
753 *** Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
752 *** I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating.
750 *** There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.
757 *** Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell.
756 *** PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
755 *** Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
754 *** Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP.
759 *** Stay away from HP.
509 *** So I called, AGAIN.
1595 *** Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.
1594 *** It is her first laptop and she is thrilled.
3072 *** I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV.
3073 *** The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
3074 *** The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;
1590 *** It can't get any better.
3076 *** Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.
3077 *** For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
2954 *** It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user, that makes it run way to slow.
3079 *** I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
2956 *** It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.
2957 *** I've had this laptop for about a month now.
1599 *** I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.
2951 *** It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would.
2952 *** There are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.
2953 *** The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.
1025 *** I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.
1024 *** Two times with in one month.
1027 *** It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.
1031 *** NO more Lenovo for me.
1021 *** This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
1020 *** I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
1023 *** This has happened three times so far.
1022 *** As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.
502 *** The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it.
1029 *** Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.
1028 *** Or the cursor would show up some place else.
2402 *** We were PC users.
500 *** We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.
501 *** A lot of help they WEREN'T!
605 *** it's just a great toy to have around.
630 *** I was informed that I need to call some 0900 number first.
607 *** tons of bloatware and junk programs.
606 *** very very slow laptop.
601 *** I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
600 *** It's A MAC!!
603 *** It's face and depanable.
602 *** I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.
1205 *** Do I like the computer? Well, other than not getting viruses, I guess it is OK.
1204 *** After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.
1207 *** bought notebook 07/2009.
1206 *** But to be honest, the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.
609 *** keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
608 *** can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
1203 *** They are closed at 9pm eastern.
1202 *** But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.
1211 *** 5 months dead again.
634 *** I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
1217 *** So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
1214 *** Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
2400 *** The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.
1447 *** I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.
1446 *** When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
1445 *** TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.
1444 *** Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.
1443 *** Summary: After doing some investigation on the web, I have found that Toshiba NB205s are not chronically not booting.
1114 *** Enough said.
1117 *** Maybe it's Acer, maybe it's MSFT.
1440 *** My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.
1119 *** I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review.
1118 *** Either way I'm furious.
1351 *** I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
1449 *** The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.
1448 *** But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
466 *** I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
461 *** A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.
450 *** My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.
460 *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
463 *** Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.
489 *** And it didn't show up on the reciept, I don't know how we ordered it online!
488 *** But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.
487 *** It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting.
486 *** That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.
485 *** I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything.
484 *** Well, maybe more like week one.
483 *** It was a Waste of money from day one!
482 *** I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com.
481 *** Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name.
480 *** This was around three years, maybe four years ago.
991 *** Just a bunch of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.
790 *** I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
695 *** It is so much easier to use
1564 *** The display is awesome.
992 *** I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.
2898 *** The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.
3004 *** I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.
199 *** Well i got this computer from Best Buy and I have had nothing but problems I bought the computer with a virus.....
198 *** do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.
2066 *** I go to purchase it on line, and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later!
195 *** 5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts
194 *** 4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
197 *** this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this "never" happen...
196 *** Do yourself a favor, this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware...
191 *** 3) Horrible customer support
190 *** 2) Blue screen first month
193 *** -got it back 3 months later
192 *** -they lost my laptop for a month
2408 *** Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
2543 *** i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me.
1454 ***   since then i have had minor problems with slow operation.
2541 *** the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.
2540 *** the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
2547 *** The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
2546 *** From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!
2545 *** i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.
2544 *** if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.
2549 *** Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
2548 *** The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
1104 *** The first programm I switched on was a game for my children.
2381 *** still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.
2380 *** previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.
2383 *** Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.
2382 *** Probably as good as you can get in a netbook, does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses.
2385 *** I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
2384 *** So far, so good!
2387 *** Screen is awesome, battery life is good.
2386 *** I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
2389 *** Good laptop for the money.
2388 *** Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
1103 *** What can I say.
2769 *** I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time.
2768 *** The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc.
1452 ***   i had the bulk of problems with my lap top within the first six months.
2763 *** I don't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it's perfect for me.
2762 *** The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
2761 *** It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.
2760 *** It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
2767 *** So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.
2766 *** I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
2765 *** I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
2764 *** I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops.
1949 *** My children won't even use it  for their school work.
902 *** 2 months later, the battery went.
903 *** They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
1849 ***   after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.
1848 ***   His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.
906 *** Not worth it one bit.
907 *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
904 *** THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
905 *** I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
1843 ***   I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
1842 ***   The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
908 *** Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
1840 *** Not a bad laptop, it's a bit slow, but gets the job done.
1847 ***   English must have been his third or fourth language.
1846 ***   Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
998 *** The notebook would not turn back on again.
1844 ***   upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.
2169 *** I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore.
1108 *** Very disappointed!
2165 *** I made the right decision.
2164 *** After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
2167 *** There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
2166 *** It runs perfectly.
2161 *** This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.
2160 *** Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
2163 *** it was a tough choice.
2162 *** I went from BestBuy to Dell, Windows to Apple.
2617 *** It really is perfect for work and play.
2616 *** I BOUGHT THEM FOR MY COLLEGE AGE GRANDCHILDREN AND THESE MACS ARE TOTALLY RELIABLE AND SUPPORT THEIR CLASS WORK 100% OF THE TIME.
2615 *** THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO.
2614 *** It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.
2613 *** So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!
2612 *** It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
2611 *** Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
2610 *** It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
2619 *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
2618 *** I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.
1908 ***   They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!
1909 ***   They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.
1906 ***   Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
1907 ***   I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters.
1904 ***   They informed me that I had around 7 "policies" or viruses on it.
1905 ***   They removed them and returned the computer to me.
1902 ***   The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
1903 ***   I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it.
1900 ***   When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it.
1901 ***   Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes.
854 ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
855 ***   They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
856 ***   I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
850 *** I never have had a good result with this computer.
851 ***   I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
853 ***   They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
858 ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
859 *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
6 *** The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.
811 *** COMPUTER HAS BEEN AT SERVICE FACILITY MORE THAN IN MY HANDS.
611 *** The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009.
1554 *** It WORKS!
740 *** This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
741 *** Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.
742 *** The perfect notebook...
743 *** When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.
744 *** The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
745 *** Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
746 *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
747 *** Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
748 *** BAck she goes!
749 *** This netbook went bad on me after 3 days.
1799 *** (The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
3063 *** I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.
3062 *** The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.
3061 *** I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems.
3060 *** I mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).
3067 *** another satisfied customer.
3066 *** I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...
2949 *** It discharges too quickly.
3064 *** The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
2947 *** wonderful features.
2946 *** Everything about this computer is easy to use.
2945 *** Thank you for your great product!
2944 *** I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
2943 *** Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
2942 *** I Love my new computer!
2941 *** I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
2940 *** Runs smooth and quick.
1050 *** *=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.
1051 *** -Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.
1052 *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1053 *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
1054 *** -No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me.
1055 *** Other Thoughts: Received replacement 16 Days later.
1056 *** Before, I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer's site.
1057 *** Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.
1058 *** But when I received my replacement, I made BOTH recovery DVDs (4), and a driver/application DVD.
1059 *** PLEASE MAKE THESE!
2917 *** The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.
1696 *** The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.
717 *** By the way teachers, they offer a discount which helps!
1694 *** Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
1695 *** I do not plan on going back.
1692 *** This causes my wrist to scrape up against it.
1693 *** I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused.
1690 *** There are a few flaws as well that I noticed.
1691 *** The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.
2595 *** Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
1791 *** Great overall.
1698 *** MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
1699 *** IT WANT TAKE IT, IT KEEP SAYING ERROR.
1278 *** Now I know!
1279 *** Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.
618 *** -They reported that the computer is in their headquarters.
619 *** Gave phonenumber.
612 *** Apple care included.
1271 *** I should have kept my big, old HP.
610 *** lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
1273 *** I now own another Hewlitt Packard.
1274 *** It's outstanding too.
1275 *** My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best.
1276 *** All the customers that come in hate Dell.
1277 *** She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.
1795 *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1794 *** I love the solid machined aluminum frame, and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I've used.
1472 *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1473 *** And this isn't just my one experine.
1470 *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1471 *** And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
1476 *** The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
1477 *** i love ths notebook.
1474 *** I've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems.
1475 *** Hope this helps!
1478 *** Purchased as a gift for a friend.
1479 *** The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
1305 *** SO? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT? C'mon, I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.
1306 *** It is as good as new.
1307 *** It's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it.
1300 *** All the yada-yada.
1301 *** and then, a guy came out to serve me instead.
1302 *** I guess he was the technical person.
1303 *** He said quite a number of people had encountered this problem and said it is a common issue.
1497 *** The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
1308 *** The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the "repair".
1309 *** Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.
498 *** And inconvenient!
499 *** I hate it!
494 *** It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted, but I didn't realize at the time it would be such a monster!
495 *** Taking it anywhere was a pain!
496 *** Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
497 *** It was weird.
490 *** But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
491 *** We didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!
492 *** It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!
493 *** It weighed like seven pounds or something like that.
24 *** It is small enough to fit in one of my purses!
25 *** Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
26 *** The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.
27 *** The ease of set up was terrific.
20 *** LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
21 *** Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
22 *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
23 *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
28 *** I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.
29 *** I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
901 *** So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
1450 *** The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
1516 *** The Macbooks worth every penny.
1709 *** The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone, then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip.
7 *** AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!
2288 *** Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
2289 *** It's the inside that is truly wonderful.
2280 *** Amazing machine.
2281 *** It is a big big, but since it has a 18.4" screen what would you expect!
2282 *** It is truly a Desktop Replacement.
2283 *** Very fast and efficient!
2284 *** Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.
2285 *** Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
2286 *** Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis.
2287 *** So honestly, I wasn't expecting anything less than perfection, and I wasn't disappointed.
972 *** I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I'm doing now!
2578 *** Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
2579 *** I still see the benefits of a PC when I do not know how to do something on my mac.
2576 *** I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.
2577 *** The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
2574 *** I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
2575 *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
2572 *** Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
2573 *** I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.
2570 *** I just love my Mac!
2571 *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
2378 *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2379 *** My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new.
2374 *** I have not have any problems.
2375 *** Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop.
2376 *** To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad.
2377 *** The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
2370 *** I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school.
2371 *** Since I purchased my Toshiba netbook, I have been very pleased with it, I have a laptob and a desktop.
2372 *** The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.
2373 *** The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
2594 *** It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
1087 *** EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.
2596 *** This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.
2597 *** While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.
2590 *** So you don't get frustrated the first few weeks.
2591 *** This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.
2592 *** I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.
2593 *** It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.
2598 *** So far, so good.
2599 *** I am a full Mac convert now.
1876 *** I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that's standard size.
1877 *** A couple things you should know:
1874 *** I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
1875 *** I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.
1872 *** I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
1873 *** When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.
1870 ***   It is just slow slow slow.
1871 ***   Unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.
1083 *** HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS.
1878 *** 1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1879 *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
977 *** It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan.
2118 *** But in fact it is totally the opposite.
975 *** Sure hope Best Buy will replace it asap.
974 *** It quit working within a weeks time.
973 *** With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
597 *** The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
971 *** So needless to day, I'm not happy.
970 *** I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.
596 *** While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I've used.
979 ***    It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous.
978 *** I have the A65 - right now it's a paperweight.
182 *** And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.
2119 *** My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC.
180 *** But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
181 *** I would  say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
186 *** Not working = bad
187 *** I spent 2200 dollars on a "top of the line laptop".
184 *** So, I must say I am not a happy camper.
185 *** In my house, HP is a nasty word.
2110 *** I 'have had it for about a 1 1/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.
2111 *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
188 *** I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.
2113 *** Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!
2114 *** I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it.
2115 *** Just for a stupid CD.
2116 *** But enough about that, I am an Apple convert for life.
2117 *** When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
2622 *** Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
2623 *** The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop.
2620 *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
2621 *** I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
2626 *** The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
2627 *** It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
2624 *** The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
2625 *** The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
2628 *** I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.
2629 *** been a PC user for many, many years.
1919 *** I got the first "Blue screen of death" in the early part of July.
1918 *** I started hainv problems with it within the first month.
1911 ***   However the frozen screens kept happening.
1910 ***   They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.
1913 ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1912 ***   I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
1915 ***   Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer.
1914 ***   EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems.
1917 *** I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008.
1916 ***   However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.
869 *** I should have sent it back to them then.
189 *** 1) Payed $2200 for a "premium" laptop
861 *** its more like a snail crawl.
860 *** No I am generous calling it slow.
863 *** he can't stand it.
862 *** I bought for my son in the 2nd grade.
865 *** I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.
864 *** I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.
867 *** It started out getting hot after only a few months.
866 *** My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months.
2756 *** The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
2025 *** I hate it.
2026 *** I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
2755 *** I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
2752 *** I am using the external speaker- sound is good.
2021 *** This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
2750 *** Satisfy what I paid for it.
2751 *** Good monitor and performed well.
2028 *** During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
2029 *** I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.
2758 *** I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend.
2759 *** This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!
883 *** You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.
881 *** After 2 months of complaints, Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.
880 *** I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.
887 *** I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
886 *** As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom,,,about 4 inches across is hardly visible.
885 *** Some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.
884 *** Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
889 *** If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing, all craziness may break loose.
888 *** The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!
657 *** It bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.
63 *** I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
775 *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
774 *** If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
777 *** HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
776 *** I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.
771 *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
770 *** If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.
773 *** I'm tired of the inept service.
772 *** Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.
779 *** This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
778 *** I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!
77 *** We are addicted to the Mac.
76 *** I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
75 *** I love it!
2979 *** Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached.
73 *** The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
72 *** This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!
3058 *** they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
70 *** It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
2972 *** Overall this laptop is great.
2973 *** It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.
3054 *** If you already own a 2009, 2010, or early 2011 model, you should wait until the next update.
3055 *** It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.
2976 *** They only stay charged a little over an hour.
2977 *** Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
2974 *** It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
78 *** This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.
1043 *** Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
1042 *** Other Thoughts: Do not purchase this product.
1041 *** Loaded with bloatware.
1040 *** Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
1047 *** -4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
1046 *** I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
1045 *** Do not purchase this laptop.
1044 *** It's not a recommendation, it' a plea.
1049 *** Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
1048 *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1681 *** I don't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.
1680 *** Mom, Dad, Brother, sister, You name it!
1683 *** " For one, I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds.
1682 *** As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
1685 *** But not in this case.
1684 *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
1687 *** Although I was promised about 10 hours, I found myself to a limited 7 hours (which is still amazing).
1686 *** Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
1689 *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1688 *** I believe this is because I was more active than the average user, meaning I average about three "tabs".
2981 *** I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.
1269 *** We did not even have it a year.
3024 *** My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
669 *** Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
668 *** the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
1263 *** HP said it was out of warranty.
1262 *** Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.
665 *** return it.
664 *** and if u did.
1267 *** It was always getting froze up.
1266 *** What a mistake!
1265 *** We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business.
660 *** It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again.
3021 *** For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
2984 *** My husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.
67 *** i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it.
1469 *** Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
1468 *** So I'd pop them off to see what the problem was, well guess what? The darn thing wouldn't go back on.
1465 *** It's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.
8 *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1467 *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
1466 *** But then, something goes wrong.
1461 ***   three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.
1460 ***   I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there.
1463 *** My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.
1462 ***   while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.
1317 *** Again.
1316 *** The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
1315 *** It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
1314 *** Because it IS a defective product.
1313 *** Who knows what will happen later on when they dismantle the whole damn thing?  So, I said I wanted a new set.
1312 *** Dismantle the whole thing? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.
1310 *** Even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.
1319 *** Do you think the shop will give me a new set?? It will NOT!
1010 *** I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair.
1011 *** I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
712 *** I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
319 *** It is super easy to use.
318 *** But the Macbook is the best!
313 *** I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).
312 *** The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
311 *** The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
310 *** I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
317 *** So this review might be a tad bit bias.
316 *** Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!
315 *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
314 *** I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
2024 *** I would never tell anyone to buy one either.
2757 *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
2754 *** I recommend for word processing and internet users.
443 *** Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.
2027 *** The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
442 *** I love the Apple products.
2020 *** I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
441 *** Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.
2753 *** Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
440 *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
2022 *** It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
2322 *** The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.
447 *** Easy learning curve.
2023 *** I will never buy another HP computer.
1330 *** This is what I call a good after sales service.
445 *** Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba's reputation for laptops it's great!
1332 *** Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.
2694 *** Peformance is good for the price.
2693 *** This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases.
2324 *** One bad thing is it gets hot.
2692 *** Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
405 *** Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
2983 *** I purchased two laptops (for my husband and 16 year old daughter).
2299 *** You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
2298 *** THis computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse.
2293 *** What's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision.
2292 *** The ease of use is wonderful.
2291 *** There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
2290 *** I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
2297 *** Buy this.
2296 *** You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
2295 *** One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free.
2294 *** Also, you won't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus.
2982 *** I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.
2569 *** It is extremely user friendly and intuitive.
2568 *** I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
2140 *** All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
2561 *** I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
2560 *** I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro.
2563 *** Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.
2562 *** You just get a trial version either way.
2565 *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2564 *** My kids (and dogs) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them.
2567 *** No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).
2566 *** That day!
1521 *** I can't imagine EVER buying a PC again!
2369 *** now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet.
2368 *** He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
2367 *** so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him.
2366 *** My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind, and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school.
2365 *** This is perfect for her field.
2364 *** Got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college.
2362 *** Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
2361 *** Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!
2360 *** Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
2587 *** One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
2586 *** Oh, it is such a great piece of equipment.
2585 *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
2584 *** The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard.
2583 *** the screen brightness automatically adjusts.
2582 *** For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer.
2581 *** Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.
2580 *** But let me tell you, the mac book pro is so professional.
402 *** Needs constant repair.
2589 *** Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.
2588 *** Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.
1861 ***   Sony, Acer, Dell, Packard Bell and Toshiba.
1860 *** I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life.
1863 ***   My favorite by far, although the most expensive, was my Sony.
1862 ***   I have used a couple of others on the job as well.
1865 ***   Until I bought the Dell, I thought you just looked for what you wanted (size, software, options, hardware) and purchase the best deal you could find.
1864 ***   It lasted for many years of travel, kids and abuse and if I fired it up today, it would work.
1867 *** I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
1866 ***   I was WRONG!
1869 ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
1868 ***   This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling.
964 *** seriously why haven't they just replaced it by now.
965 *** I practically have a new laptop with all the "fixes" they have done!
966 ***   So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped.
967 *** of course my warranty runs out next month.
960 *** another problem.
961 ***   This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
962 ***   When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!
963 ***   Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.
968 ***   I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I don't run accross a situation like this again!
969 *** The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
2109 *** I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops, and they have been outstanding, including this one.
2108 *** I'm very happy with this machine!
2103 *** So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one, if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells.
2102 *** This machine rocks!
2101 *** Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.
2100 *** I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of, like my cad programs.
2107 *** I wasn't really as concerned about portability (it's a very large laptop) but it's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise.
2106 *** It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.
2105 *** It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
2104 *** This computer is the ideal college companion.
2639 *** I loved it then, but unfortunately it was before the days of wireless internet.
2638 *** I got a mac as my HS graduation gift.
2635 *** great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.
2634 *** The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
2637 *** Delivery was early too.
2636 *** the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
2631 *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2630 *** Let me tell you, this machine is great.
2633 *** The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
2632 *** I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
2986 *** They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes.
1241 *** Every single one we've gotten we've had problems with.
878 *** The tech store I purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.
640 *** They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive (I don't really understand why but anyway).
876 *** After 3 pleasant weeks of use, the laptop just died.
877 *** That's right, no power, absolutely NOTHING.
874 *** I'll stick to Tashiba.
875 *** I believe I purchased this in Dec 09 for my primary work laptop which is used 5-10 hours a day, 4-6 days a week.
872 *** I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
873 *** I had a toshiba for 10 years.
870 *** At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.
871 *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
2037 *** I waited and waited and no laptop.
2740 *** It has no camera but, I can always buy and install one easy.
2035 *** I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
2742 *** That's the downside for me.
2033 *** I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
2032 *** The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.
2031 *** They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.
2746 *** It was over rated!
9 *** The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)
2748 *** Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.
2039 *** I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
1532 *** My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit.
890 *** Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
891 *** Thank God for "ctrl Z"Bottom line, I've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there.
892 *** No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems.
893 *** My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model.
894 *** She tells me about it all the time but I tend to shut off all cognitive functions when she gets that yapper going.
895 *** Lord HAVE MERCY!
896 *** Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop.
897 *** Enjoy your sitdown
898 *** At first when I got this product, I loved it.
899 *** The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
1530 *** Its also FUN to use!
649 *** -Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.
1248 *** They freeze all the time.
1537 *** This is a great machine!
1964 *** This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.
1965 *** I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.
1966 *** It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
2965 *** I love everything about it.
2964 *** Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba.
768 *** This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
1967 *** In my opinion it was not as user friendly as I expected either.
2961 *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
2960 *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
2963 *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
2962 *** This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
1780 *** I bought my first MacBook after seeing the product demonstrated.
1781 *** Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.
1782 *** Now they are believers in the product.
761 *** With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.
1784 *** I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done.
1785 *** Honestly, this is absolutely wonderful.
764 *** Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.
1787 *** I'm just really happy that I waited to buy, because this thing kicks a$$!
3049 *** Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).
3048 *** I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
1610 *** My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
3041 *** Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).
3040 *** I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.
3043 *** I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
1611 *** It doesnt overheat or make any loud noises.
3045 *** Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.
3044 *** So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.
3047 *** (Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
3046 *** So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.
707 *** I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.
1078 *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1079 *** Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.
1076 *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
1077 *** (3DMARK6 score is only 8500).
1074 *** But, buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM (2x2GB for $92 or 1x4GB for $99), and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM.
1075 *** It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
1072 *** Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
1073 *** I shipped out on Saturday, July 17.
1070 *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
1071 *** I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
1678 *** I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
1679 *** The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
1674 *** All for such a great price.
1675 *** It's color is even cool.
1676 *** Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
1677 *** They are so realistic I am just speechless.
1670 *** If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.
1671 *** It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.
1672 *** It doesn't bother me though.
1673 *** It doesn't heat up like my old laptop.
1094 *** This computer was bought because I wanted "top of the line", fast, reliable, HA.
1095 *** I also purchased Office Max's "Max Assurance" with the "no lemon" clause.
1096 *** It was a laugh  too!
1097 ***  I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
1090 *** I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK!
1091 *** This thing sucks!
1092 *** I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian) After on Hour mine was at 53% life left and his was at 69% life left.
1093 *** That's a huge difference.
674 *** This computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!
675 *** 10 plus hours of battery...
676 *** super fast processor and really nice graphics card..
677 *** 4gb of ram...
670 *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
1099 *** It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!
672 *** Love it so far.
673 *** Being a PC user my whole life....
1533 *** She said its very user friendly.
1418 ***   Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
1419 ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
71 *** I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest.
1410 *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1411 *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1412 *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
1413 *** Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
1414 *** The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
1415 *** In all honesty, if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop, then do not buy this computer.
1416 *** The Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail !
1417 ***   The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
1322 *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
1323 *** I left the place angrily.
1320 *** I worked in IT retail sales before.
644 *** I claim that this has no value to me, the laptop was new anyway.
1326 *** The machine itself is alright.
1327 *** But the arm velcro is torn after one use.
1324 *** Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.
1325 *** You know what? I happened to buy a defective blood pressure monitor a week ago at the Bukit Batok Polyclinic NHG Pharmacy a week ago.
1328 *** So, I went back.
1329 *** The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
2494 *** The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!
5 *** This is definitely a computer worth the money;
647 *** *6th week*-They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit...
1256 *** Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.
1525 *** Never been hacked.
1254 *** After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).
1255 *** I should have checked this before I installed my applications.
1252 *** Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
1253 *** It cannot save the correct date and time I set.
1522 *** I have had a Mac for 6 years and won't go back to PC.
1251 *** I got this laptop on Black Friday.
1528 *** I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
1529 *** A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
1258 *** It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.
1259 *** Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
308 *** On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
309 *** Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
300 *** I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.
301 *** I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
302 *** I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.
303 *** Take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.
304 *** I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.
305 *** Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop).
306 *** That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.
307 *** My MacBook Pro is no exception.
1381 *** You better believe my next computer will be a MAC!
2978 *** I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.
74 *** The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.
1625 *** I cannot be happier with the service or product.
3059 *** This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops.
2475 *** While many people brag about Mac being "intuitive", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.
3056 *** The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
2474 *** The difference is phenomenal.
3057 *** cosmetically, the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top.
2970 *** I did not have to call the support line at all.
2971 *** Everything was so easy.
3052 *** Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember.
3053 *** About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.
79 *** The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!
3051 *** I will be patient for few months.
2479 *** It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs, using the internet, and doing other things everyone does on a computer.
985 ***   Acer won't replace the laptop.
470 *** It was an all around waste of money for me.
2950 *** Kind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.
114 *** It's very annoying.
2990 *** Right size and weight for portability.
117 *** It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.
2358 *** I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.
2359 *** The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.
2352 *** A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.
2353 *** They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.
2350 *** I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
2351 *** Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker.
2356 *** I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!
2357 *** I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.
2354 *** I'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same.
2355 *** It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.
2991 *** Battery life needs more life.
112 *** The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it's very noticeable.
1898 ***   I took the laptop home and not even a month later, I began to have problems with it.
1899 ***   The problems started with just the screen freezing.
1894 *** I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.
1895 *** Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.
1896 *** I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation.
1897 ***   I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.
1890 *** Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.
1891 *** After 5 months of failed repairs, requested a full refund but was refused and it still is not repaired and Acer is indifferent to the issue.
1892 *** I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
1893 *** Three weeks after I bought the netbook, the screen quit working.
959 *** for two months, when YOU GUESSED IT.
958 *** All was well.
2134 *** I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch.
2135 *** I would buy this lap top over and over again!
2132 *** The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.
2133 *** But you must get the 15 inch.
2130 *** I also liked the glass screen.
2131 *** it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop.
951 *** on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!
950 ***   The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
953 ***   Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.
952 *** The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
955 *** It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!
954 ***   Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.
957 ***   By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf!
956 ***   I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.
1442 *** Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.
2648 *** Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.
2649 *** The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.
2640 *** So a couple of years later, I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet.
2641 *** I couldn't afford a new mac, so I bought a PC instead.
2642 *** big mistake!
2643 *** I have recently converted back to a mac and I couldn't be happier!
2644 *** It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!
2645 *** I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.
2646 *** Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.
2647 *** The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.
2994 *** The only downfall is the volume control.
2002 *** Of course, eMachines cannot be made entirely to blame for this computer's woes;
2003 *** Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.
2000 *** Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
2001 *** Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.
2006 *** Now, I guess, I'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor, hapless soul.
2007 *** Buyers beware.
2004 *** If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
2005 *** it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.
3033 *** My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.
2008 *** Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
2009 ***   The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
719 *** It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
2995 *** The wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn't work in real time.
1268 *** Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
507 *** When I turned it on, nothing.
667 *** The battery is really long.
666 *** I have loved this since i took it out of the box.
504 *** When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great.
1261 *** But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.
918 ***  THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
2910 *** Highly recommend for daily use.
2911 *** We now own two of these, identical.
2912 *** This laptop serves all my needs.
1260 *** HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC      When I first got this computer, it really rocked.
2914 *** Price and purpose is awesome!
2915 *** This a starter notebook.
2916 *** The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
718 *** The Toshiba Mini Notebook, Model NB 305-N410BL, is a great little computer.
2918 *** If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor.
2919 *** I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.
715 *** Money and time well spent!
714 *** I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.
713 *** I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.
1796 *** Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
711 *** Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.
710 *** Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.
661 *** There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.
716 *** Highly recommended!
1264 *** Guess I'll stay away from HP.
2178 *** The advantages of owning 'a 'mac are numerous.
1069 *** The Bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done.
1068 *** I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
2179 *** One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).
1061 *** Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
1060 *** You will need them if you want to reload the OS (I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal).
1063 *** Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
1062 *** The only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.
1065 *** Everything else just install and go.
1064 *** For the Bluetooth to work properly, you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD, or it will not show after the reload.
1067 *** Unless you need the Bluetooth 3.
1066 *** One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10
3023 *** The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.
1669 *** It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!
1668 *** The only bad part is the size/weight.
1667 *** I am just amazed.
1666 *** It is super fast, and always loads.
1665 *** I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!
1664 *** My friends are in awe every time they come over!
1663 *** It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!
1662 *** The Awesomest of the awesomest.
1661 *** Shiny  This Laptop is the Best of the best!
1660 *** Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
591 *** In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.
1086 *** EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED (THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST) OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED.
1085 *** WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
1084 *** THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.
595 *** In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.
1082 *** Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
1081 *** So if you move laptop a lot, it might get loose, however it sits pretty tightly.
1080 *** Also, HDD secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.
599 *** It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.
598 *** I highly recommend this product!
1089 *** Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.
1088 *** A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.
2828 *** Excellent speed for processing data.
2829 *** And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.
2824 *** Simple to use, and great graphics.
2825 *** It has everything I would need for a home computer.
2826 *** I'm very impressed.
2827 *** This computer I used daily nice compact design.
2820 *** Fast, great visual!
2821 *** Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
2822 *** I use that alot on my desktop, so I am adjusting to not having it.
2823 *** This is a great little computer for the price.
2602 *** Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
1409 *** But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.
1408 *** Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explantory in use.
1403 *** I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.
1402 *** I had to have these computers in my school.
1401 *** so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
1400 *** with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
1407 *** My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
1406 *** Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.
1405 *** Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.
1404 *** My computer was one of the best in the school compared to my fellow classmates.
692 *** They definitely have a superior product!
449 *** I love the 15" MacBook Pro.
448 *** Also the display is exceptional!
1339 *** You just lose a customer.
1338 *** The brand is tarnished in my heart.
1547 *** ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.
1335 *** However, this will be my last as well.
1334 *** This is my first LG product.
1337 *** There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future.
1336 *** So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.
1331 *** C'mon, LG.
446 *** I love the glass touchpad.
1333 *** 1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.
444 *** Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.
65 *** I would never buy a Dell again.
691 *** I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!
1542 *** The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.
697 *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
39 *** The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
38 *** In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).
1540 *** It even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well.
33 *** It is held in place magnetically.
32 *** First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
31 *** Screen is crystal clear, yes it's small - but it's a netbook!
30 *** Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
37 *** Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.
36 *** This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.
35 *** Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.
34 *** There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.
641 *** -I give up on my data, I just want a computer reasonably fast...
1240 *** I'm not going to lie, I've never really liked the Acer brand in general.
643 *** They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop.
642 *** -They say it will take "up to two weeks".
645 *** I complain again...
1244 *** If anything, I would only suggest using one of these laptops if only you have to.
1531 *** The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
646 *** they respond: "your dissatisfaction is noted"...
1249 *** Honestly, I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for!
648 *** Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.
1539 *** Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).
1538 *** The design is awesome, quality is unprecedented.
339 *** Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.
338 *** My only disappointment with the 13" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).
335 *** The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.
334 *** It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).
337 *** However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
336 *** Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.
331 *** It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.
330 *** The 13" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.
333 *** It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.
332 *** It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.
2061 *** I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.
1026 *** So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
543 *** after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
1523 *** They don't crash.
545 *** Summary: Spend your money elsewhere
1464 *** At first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.
2542 *** i can use it for all of my needs.
1636 *** To this day, there are NONE.
2854 *** Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
2065 *** After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
152 *** The touch pad is among the best.
1991 *** Very annoying.
2345 *** I love it and the change in lifestyle that came with it.
2344 *** However, If I sound enthusiastic about this, I am!
2347 *** Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around.
2346 *** I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.
2341 *** It's fun to take to a bookstore, sit in the coffee shop area, sign in to WiFi and look up book reviews of books I might buy.
2340 *** I use it now more than I even thought I would.
2343 *** Note that I don't ordinarily take the time to write a review.
2342 *** Look up recipes and keep it on the kitchen counter while I cook.
2349 *** The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.
2348 *** The unibody design is edgy and durable.
1455 ***   also the battery is completely shot.
233 *** From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.
2067 *** I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.
2148 *** My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.
1889 *** Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable.
1888 *** Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed (except for speaker grill) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all.
1887 *** Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.
1886 *** The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed.
1885 *** If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more, or buy a USB wireless card.
1884 *** ASUS said my net-book was working properly.
1883 *** My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine, and any connections I turn on should work.
1882 *** YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.
1881 *** When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC.
1880 *** When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service, on my Eee PC I get 3 bars.
2121 *** They also use two totally different operating systems.
2120 *** My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.
2123 *** It all just makes sense.
2122 *** I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products.
2125 *** Where you click and hold and drag it picture, link, etc to where you want it.
2124 *** Mostly I love the drag and drop feature.
948 ***   The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.
2126 *** But reasons we chose this Apple computer.
2129 *** It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.
2128 *** I liked the aluminum body.
944 ***   The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating, even if on for less than an hour!
1457 ***   i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
942 ***   Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken (manuf issue).
943 ***   They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new.
940 ***   I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty, you will probably need it!
941 *** I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
3038 *** If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.
2659 *** We haven't had any problems with it at all.
2658 *** This is a great computer.
2653 *** The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).
2652 *** I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.
2651 *** I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.
2650 *** That is how it is able to function better than any other PC.
2657 *** We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired.
2656 *** This is a great value for the money.
2655 *** Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.
2654 *** Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.
769 *** Asked the customer service rep.
132 *** For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
131 *** i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy.
130 *** but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.
137 *** breaks easily.
136 *** it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one.
135 *** it is the worst computer dell ever made.
134 *** Be safe buy a Sony.
139 *** Well, maybe I was just very unlucky.
138 *** only good thing is the graphics quality.
1606 *** I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot.
2019 *** The computer would not ever cut back on.
2018 *** The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.
2015 *** It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
2014 *** It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
2017 *** I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.
2016 *** My son said it popped up and he clicked update.
2011 ***   The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
2010 ***   Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
2013 *** I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present.
2012 *** Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought.
1793 *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
2112 *** Even out of warranty!
2903 *** without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.
2902 *** I have found also, it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access;
2901 *** I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
2900 *** I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.
708 *** It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow.
709 *** My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple.
2905 *** I am very pleased with my purchase!
2904 *** I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.
704 *** Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient.
705 *** I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college.
2909 *** Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
2908 *** Not super fancy, but not super expensive either.
700 *** Speakers doesn't sound that great.
701 *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
702 *** Okay, let's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy.
703 *** I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.
88 *** Before i bought my new i5, I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability, dependable, and long lasting operations.
89 *** Buy it, love it, and I promise you won't regret it.
82 *** The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.
83 *** Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.
80 *** Great laptop that offers many great features!
81 *** Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
86 *** I have had my new Macbook Pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled ALL of my old PC laptops.
87 *** It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.
84 *** While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.
85 *** Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.
1658 *** Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
1659 *** Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
1652 *** And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro.
410 *** i try to use it today and I can't logon.
1650 *** With the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.
1651 *** And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
1656 *** If you are a person like me, more on the creative side, the mac has something for you too.
1657 *** Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.
1654 *** It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.
1655 *** Such as PAGES, NUMBERS, and so on.
586 *** I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them
1630 *** I took it back for an Asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset.
584 *** I will only buy apple laptops from now on.
585 *** It is the easiest computer I have ever used
582 *** The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
580 *** In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.
1631 *** Finally, I purchased a Toshiba.
1632 *** Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!
588 *** I LOVE IT!
589 *** I can't say enough good for it!
1985 *** From the get-go, the M6809 was unsteady in its operation;
2839 *** the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.
2838 *** i tried turning it done but it did nothing.
2837 *** the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
1634 *** I had finally reached my limit and broke down.
2835 *** it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.
2834 *** it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.
2833 *** the laptop preformed pretty well.
2832 *** was a great deal i will give that.
2831 *** All in all great item highly recommend it.
1635 *** With a healthy pessimism, I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw.
1436 *** I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.
1437 *** I can't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.
1434 *** More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.
1435 *** It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.
1432 *** I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.
1433 *** Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.
1430 *** I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some of the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.
1431 *** With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.
1380 ***   After paying over $1000 for this computer, it was not worth it.
1981 *** On 3 July 2004, I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $150
1438 *** Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.
1439 *** In short I would never buy a Compaq again.
1299 *** Of course, I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others.
1348 *** in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.
1349 *** They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
1340 *** Yeah, to you.
451 *** It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
452 *** (I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
453 *** There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
454 *** The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
455 *** iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
1346 *** But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.
1347 *** they had to replace the motherboard in April
3032 *** This ain't it.
766 *** But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
656 *** However, this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it.
1503 *** So this was great for me.
654 *** Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures.
655 *** It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.
652 *** It was a great laptop, ran great and was really fast.
1507 *** It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me.
650 *** -Stay away from Apple, or hope you laptop does not break down.
651 *** Well, I bought this laptop a month or two ago.
3085 *** I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.
3084 *** Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.
1508 *** Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.
1509 *** But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.
3081 *** Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.
3080 *** I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.
658 *** It was a bad experience but i played down its importance.
659 *** I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.
1992 *** Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.
2127 *** Ok first.
1598 *** I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.
949 *** it was shooting sparks!
946 ***   Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school.
947 *** Now, the next issue I had freaked me out.
2815 *** They click.
945 ***   Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.
2814 *** The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.
57 *** I needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only reason I didn't purchase a Mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs.
322 *** I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.
323 *** But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.
320 *** All you have to do is turn it on and it works.
321 *** It is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.
326 *** I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
327 *** Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.
324 *** :) In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.
325 *** I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.
328 *** Hope this helped!
329 *** I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).
56 *** I am sorry that I purchased this laptop.
564 *** believe me apple has a reputation.
2818 *** i would have to say that overall its great!
2330 *** (I'm an excellent touch typist, and my hands are very sensitive, too.
2331 *** ) I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.
2332 *** It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.
2333 *** Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the "human interface.
2334 *** "  I've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT.
2335 *** The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.
2336 *** I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;
2337 *** the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.
2338 *** I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.
2339 *** I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.
1341 *** I am just ONE of the million customers.
1597 *** I previously purchased a 13" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (If I am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.
1596 *** Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.
1995 *** I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
1591 *** Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.
3075 *** I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.
1593 *** Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since "learning how to use it".
1592 *** Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
3078 *** the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
2955 *** It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
2488 *** The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
2489 *** I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.
2486 *** The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
2487 *** It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.
2484 *** I've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks, and it really is a great computer.
2485 *** I have only had PCs with Windows before so this takes a little getting use to.
2482 *** We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
2483 *** We'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again!
2480 *** Being virus-resistant is a huge plus.
2481 *** It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC's.
2248 *** In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.
2249 *** This comes in very handy for me as an educator.
2244 *** I would definitely suggest this laptop!
2245 *** It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all.
2246 *** It has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.
2247 *** iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.
2240 *** Received the product promptly and without any issues.
2241 *** Would do business again.
2242 *** The graphics are stunning.
2243 *** It's wonderful for computer gaming.
995 *** It did fairly well, other than it's poor performance, overheating and occational blue screen.
2465 *** Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of "extra key", etc.
2466 *** I love the keyboard.
996 *** On the twelfth day that I had the notebook, I decided to go to Dell's website and update it.
2460 *** It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
990 *** The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.
993 *** First of all, I've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years.
2463 *** It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.
999 *** I returned it to Best Buy on the ninteenth of April.
2469 *** This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.
120 *** The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.
121 *** All in all, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop, and with HP as a whole.
122 *** I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well.
123 *** This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.
124 *** It is not ideal for children because of the temp.
125 *** I Contacted HP  about this situation and was given excuses, without results.
126 *** They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.
127 *** I will never purchase a HP again ever.
128 *** this is my second one and the same problem, bad video card  unreliable overall, this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.
129 *** bought the first asus laptop in san francisco, returned it in santa maria, thinking it was just a problem with that computer.
133 *** This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix.
1295 *** As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
2068 *** I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).
2069 *** I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
2798 *** the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
2799 *** I shopped around before buying.
2060 *** VERY disappointing:
2793 *** Yes, I have it on the highest available setting.
2062 *** About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash.
2063 *** Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
2064 *** One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers.
2797 *** Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
2794 *** I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.
2795 *** At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.
521 *** I think it was seventy nine plus tax.
2666 *** The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
2667 *** I like the laptop overall.
2664 *** NOW AM VERY APREHENSIVE ABOUT TOSHIBA LAPTOPS.
2665 *** WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU
2662 *** BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART, I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM.
2663 *** THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.
2660 *** The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.
2661 *** Overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.
722 *** Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.
2668 *** The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
2669 *** Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
2938 *** I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.
2939 *** This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
2936 *** Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
2937 *** I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
2934 *** The internet speed is spectacular.
2935 *** The battery life is probably an hour at best.
2932 *** To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
2933 *** The graphics are great.
2930 *** ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
2931 *** I babyed the heck out of it and i still do.
1559 *** THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.
1645 *** See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.
1644 *** The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding.
1647 *** And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
1646 *** But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
1641 *** I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
1640 *** And in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.
1643 *** To those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!
1642 *** I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!
1835 *** I will NEVER buy (Refurbished) again, I don't cae how cheap it is.
1649 *** And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
1648 *** And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
1742 *** Size: I know 13 is small (especially for a desktop replacement) but with an external monitor, who cares.
1743 *** But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough (this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.
579 *** I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.
578 *** The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
604 *** As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
573 *** I highly recommend that you buy this product.
572 *** 10 hours of battery life is really something else....
571 *** very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
570 *** I like this machine because its very lightweight...
577 *** It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
576 *** My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.
575 *** I work in film editing and post production, so I need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.
574 *** I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.
2808 *** Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
2809 *** I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.
2802 *** I LOVE it!
2803 *** I should have bought one a long time ago.
2800 *** I wasn't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money!
2801 *** It Was a great deal after all.
2806 *** the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.
2807 *** the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
2804 *** Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!
1208 *** in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1421 *** So far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the HP I replaced.
1420 ***  Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
1423 *** My problem was with DELL Customer Service.
1422 *** Time will tell.
1425 *** In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
1424 *** My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.
1427 *** BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
1426 *** I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
1429 *** Everything is falling apart internally and externally.
1428 *** The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!
939 *** it has had some problems.
731 *** It's slow and one day i hope to have the money to get rid of it and buy something else.
730 *** Much of which HP ended up paying for.
733 *** Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
732 *** Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
735 *** I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.
734 *** I would like to use a different operating system altogether.
737 *** I am taking back today.
736 *** got another 1, and same issue.
739 *** Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years, and never a issue.
738 *** Don't waste your money or time.
2403 *** Exactly that, users.
1359 *** The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.
1358 *** Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
469 *** I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.
468 *** I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling.
1353 *** I had less problems.
1352 *** This is my first computer purchase
467 *** The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased.
1350 *** Best Buy laughed when I told them they should replace it instead of expecting me to be without a computer again for another couple of weeks.
1357 *** After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.
1356 *** Unfortunately, that is not the case.
1355 *** Runs Hot  I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.
1354 *** really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children.
2158 *** It easily fits into most computer bags but doesn't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks.
2159 *** The battery life is also relatively good.
1519 *** , which Apple doesn't offer, is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy.
1518 *** The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
1515 *** I am loyal to Apple.
1514 *** This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials.
1517 *** They're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.
2409 *** The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
1511 *** There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
1510 *** I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.
1513 *** No Viruses!
1512 *** The #1 reason that is always repeated.
1798 *** And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.
723 *** I've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i don't regret buying it.
617 *** No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
49 *** In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
357 *** Keyboard is reasonable size.
356 *** great battery life.
355 *** I would not recommend this product to anyone.
354 *** The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
353 *** From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.
352 *** My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.
351 *** So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
350 *** also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
359 *** Charger seems large for this class of computer.
358 *** Small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel.
43 *** It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.
2323 *** I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use.
1111 *** Don't buy this model.
2321 *** It's so useable and responsive.
2320 *** I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.
2327 *** I have a laptop as my regular computer, but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag.
2326 *** Winters is on it's way and I imagine it will be cozy.
2325 *** But I don't see it as a problem.
1110 *** Going to bring it to service today.
2329 *** While it was highly rated, would I like it? I tried the keyboard at the store, and it seemed ok.
2328 *** I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL.
1113 *** Not even safe mode boots.
289 *** I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
288 *** There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!
1112 *** Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
281 *** I think this computer is super lame.
280 *** Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.
283 *** I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.
282 *** I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
285 *** It doesnt work worth a damn.
284 *** I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.
287 *** I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.
286 *** The display is beyond horrible.
1441 *** STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.
1116 *** I'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.
263 *** I HATE this one.
262 *** I have owned many computers and laptops.
261 *** apple and quess what, you have to send the whole laptop in, too bad, so sad
260 *** oh yeah, and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed?
267 *** The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.
266 *** The book is useless.
1792 *** Screen is a bit glossy, but that's not too bad.
264 *** Vista is a nightmare.
269 *** Thinking about returning it
268 *** this is one of the reasons I purchased it.
1290 *** I thought it would be a simple job.
2499 *** Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
2498 *** But if you're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc.
1563 *** I'd recommend this laptop to anyone!
2491 *** First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
2490 *** 2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into
2493 *** Plus stylish.
2492 *** Amazing Quality!
2495 *** The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
2192 *** I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I can't imagine ever going back.
2497 *** BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
2496 *** Mac is not made for gaming.
259 *** They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
1566 *** Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
2259 *** I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop.
2258 *** , Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
2257 *** Awesome graphics!
2256 *** The benefits were immediate!
2255 *** I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.
2254 *** Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops, it is worth the price.
2253 *** If you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.
2252 *** In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.
2251 *** It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click.
2250 *** iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.
2477 *** I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.
2476 *** I sit down and use my husband's work PC and I don't like it one bit.
988 *** Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.
989 *** I've tried going back to XL but there still problems.
2473 *** We were occasional Mac users before, but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford.
2472 *** It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.
2471 *** Suffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.
2470 *** Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.
982 ***   Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.
983 *** Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
980 ***      First it burned or fused the power adapter plug.
981 ***   I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
986 *** the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
987 ***   This thing is a lemon.
984 *** This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
2478 *** All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler, quicker, and easier.
115 *** The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.
252 *** This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
1790 *** If you can afford a new laptop, and are in the market for one, of course, then definitely go for this.
116 *** Despite the inconvenient weight, I opted for the 12 cell battery.
111 *** The keyboard, which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard, now looks terrible.
1293 *** She told me flatly, "It's like that one.
113 *** In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.
253 *** Another issue I have with it is the battery.
119 *** I have a lapdesk which I can use, but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.
118 *** I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!
2785 *** Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
2784 *** It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.
2787 *** Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.
2786 *** The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.
2781 *** The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.
2780 *** There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.
2783 *** Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
2782 *** while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.
2789 *** Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.
2788 *** I bought it for really cheap also and it's AMAZING.
1797 *** It's now all commodity hardware.
2079 *** If I have a few hundred dollars to spare, I'd buy the Pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model.
2078 *** I love this 13" Mac white unibody.
2073 *** Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
2072 *** I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.
2071 *** So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
2070 *** Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
2077 *** The screen shows great colors.
2076 *** It's fast and has excellent battery life.
2075 *** I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.
2074 *** Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
1389 *** You will regret it if you buy any dell.
2671 *** while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.
2670 *** I've had a Toshiba laptop in the past;
2673 *** The screen isn't huge, but that doesn't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV.
2672 *** The price is great for this model, I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room.
2675 *** I had static in the output, and I had to reduce the sound output quality to "FM" as opposed to the default "CD.
2674 *** One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB.
2677 *** As with any laptop not purchased with software options, it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications.
2676 *** " This isn't a big deal, I haven't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media, only through USB output.
2679 *** Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.
2678 *** Took a while to clean it up to my specs.
1209 *** 1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
2929 *** It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
2928 *** That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
2921 *** Save your money and go for a better device.
2920 *** It is a cheap throw together.
2923 *** The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.
2922 *** I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.
2925 *** I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.
2924 *** Great product.
2927 *** Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.
2926 *** The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
2907 *** No problems, no lock ups, no disappointments.
2906 *** Excellent product for the money.
1986 *** I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.
1987 *** The cover for the DVD drive soon came off, too--a mark of poor construction quality.
1984 *** Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.
1633 *** As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
1982 *** It wasn't worth it.
1983 *** At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.
1980 *** I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.
1637 *** I can do everything I could before, only faster and more efficiently.
1638 *** The battery life is great.
1639 *** The software is amazing.
1988 *** Despite the plethora of problems, I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years.
1989 *** Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer, so I had to remove it.
706 *** I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.
568 *** This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, I find not much difference except of course for the screen size.
569 *** But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
2817 *** Bought it to use mostly for oline classes.
2816 *** sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!
2811 *** Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!
2810 *** So far so good with this laptop.
2813 *** Memory is upgradable.
2812 *** Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.
560 *** it is very easy for anyone to use an apple and specially the mcbook pro notebook.
561 *** this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet.
562 *** the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it.
563 *** the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds.
2819 *** Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.
565 *** they will not let you down.
566 *** pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.
567 *** just chill and enjoy.
1188 *** Even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its  queen every time.
1189 *** Now for the hardware problems.
1186 *** And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no  forward delete  key.
1187 *** Another included program that is laughable is the chess game.
1184 *** ) And printing from either word processor is an adventure.
1185 *** Hieroglyphics are quite common.
1182 *** They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
1183 *** (You may be reading one now!
1180 *** After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish, I broke down and spent another $100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac.
1181 *** That seemed to solve the problem, till I wrote an article with semicolons in it.
726 *** It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart.
727 *** When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it, taped it shut  resold it as new.
724 *** It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on.
725 *** After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
1748 *** Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.
1749 *** Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.
720 *** Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter, thru Windows 7 Home Premium, to Windows 7 Professional was a snap;
721 *** both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.
1744 *** Supplied software: The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with.
1745 *** Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.
1746 *** Screen, keyboard, and mouse: If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen, responsive island backlit keyboard, and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.
1747 *** Downfalls: sharp edges.
1740 *** The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.
1741 *** I can throw anything at it (and I do), Pictures, video editing, schoolwork.
728 *** HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back.
729 *** It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here.
1164 *** but it came back in even worse shape.
1165 *** Avoid this model.
1166 *** After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route.
1167 *** They don't seem to be susceptible to viruses, which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers.
1160 *** I'm going back to PC.
1161 *** At least those computers didn't just die on me like this one.
1162 *** UPDATE: Two years after buying this laptop, I am now the proud owner of a lemon.
1163 *** After numerous calls to Applecare tech support, I was directed to send in my computer;
1168 *** But while this is one big advantage (as you may know from the company s recent commercials) there are other things to consider before going with Apple.
1169 *** (For those old enough to remember, it is similar to Beta versus VHS.
1366 ***   After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.
2913 *** Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment.
48 *** I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.
473 *** Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.
46 *** It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
47 *** My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
44 *** I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
45 *** Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.
42 *** I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
2034 *** I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
40 *** I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.
41 *** Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.
1568 *** This mac is great!
1569 *** lightweight, long battery life, excellent transition from PC;
1298 *** I was starting to boil.
471 *** I didn't like one thing about it.
1788 *** Still pretty pricey, but I've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund, and finally got to use it.
1560 *** It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.
1561 *** With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!
1562 *** The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it!
1291 *** But I was wrong.
1296 *** She brought out 2 other identical netbooks and still insist that "It is like that one".
1565 *** The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market.
1294 *** " Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't LIKE THAT.
1567 *** But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
1713 *** Love the speed, especially!
474 *** Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.
1712 *** This was an update from an early MacBook Pro.
1361 *** Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.
795 *** so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
2425 *** It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
794 *** not the day received.
1789 *** Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.
2551 *** Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience!
1717 *** ( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
1716 *** There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can't be used with the iBook.
1715 *** Thanks, MacConnection, for making this a seamless purchase!
590 *** I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!
1201 *** Once again, I was told it was the suspicious  power supply  problem.
1714 *** So glad I decided to upgrade!
472 *** I went right out and purchased another laptop.
1367 ***   Before we got this laptop, had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems.
1364 *** Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
1365 *** Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.
1362 *** Sent unit back and it's been two months.
477 *** They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.
1360 *** In fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.
475 *** They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
478 *** It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat.
479 *** I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday.
1368 ***   After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq.
1369 *** This is a review of windows vista system.
