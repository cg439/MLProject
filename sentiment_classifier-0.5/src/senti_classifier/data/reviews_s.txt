Good Overall Value - Worth the purchase price, with notable pros/cons
These will probably work well for most people, but for my use, I would change some elements of the design (mainly cord issues)
What I was looking for was a portable set of buds to listen to music for up to 8 hours a day
My requirements were comfort, good noise isolation (I am a cabinetmaker), durability, and sound quality - relative price wasn't much of a factor
I have an older iPod Nano (8 GB Silver - 6th Generation) that clips to the back of my shirt collar as well as a Sony SBH20B bluetooth receiver
Both of these allow me to connect the buds in back and keep the wires out of harms way (as opposed to having a player on my hip or in my pocket)
A microphone wasn't all that important since I wasn't planning to use this with my phone
and I have a set of Bose MIE2i buds and Bose Bluetooth earpiece for that purpose
The reason I chose not to use my Bose buds for regular music listening were as follows: the cord was too long so it interfered with my work, the control/mic portion added unnecessary bulk, noise isolation on that design is only modest relative to a full in-ear design like these buds, and I don't particularly care for the music curve (which is a subjective evaluation) Bose designed into those sets
These elements might or might not matter to you depending on your preferences and application
The good: tonal balance is very natural and open - better than I would expect at this price point and certainly enjoyable for on the go listening
In direct comparison to the Bose buds at 3x the price, I prefer the Sennheiser's clarity and accuracy
I am an audio guy with a dedicated music rig at my house that includes Sennheiser over the ear reference headphones as well as B&W CM5 speakers
ultimately, all music quality is "subjective", so this is just my opinion, but Sennheiser has done a good job at delivering this level of quality at a bargain price point
The Bose set (which I love for calls and even casual music listening) is more distant (soundstage collapses compared to the Sennheiser) and muddy (particularly in the mid-bass region)
Both sound "good" compared to stock buds, but the sound curves each company chose to employ are very different - this is where personal preference will come into play
Fit was good with the sleeves that came installed
several hours of listening didn't leave me fatigued or in pain from the fit
The noise isolation was better on the CX300's than the Bose which was also a plus for my application
Now on to the drawbacks (for me): Upon first opening the package, I was surprised to see that one leg of the cord (from the split) was longer than the other - also, the cord itself looks pretty flimsy
The supposed purpose is to allow routing of the wires behind your head (which should be a good thing for my application), but it didn't work well for me
The weight and location of the splitter tugged on my left earbud as I moved around which constantly reminded me that I was wearing buds
After some activity, it did finally pull enough for me to decide it was going to be too much of a distraction for me
In stationary listening applications, they would probably be fine
To be fair, Sennheiser never marketed these as being designed for active use
They also have a 685 sport series that might be a better fit for my use, but I thought the sound quality might not be as good as the CX300's (the water resistant technology has the potential to impact the overall sound quality)
I have a discontinued set of Sennheiser / Adidas buds (MX-680) that look similar to the 685's which have finally bit the dust after 2 years of service (a good run for my heavy use)
The fit of the 680s was terrific for me, and the sound quality was decent (somewhat "thin" sounding and dynamics were compressed at moderate volume levels with heavy material)
Since they are discontinued and I thought I could improve on sound quality, I figured I would try some new models
I didn't realize it until now, but a huge advantage to this older set (for my use) is that it has a short cord length (only 18" or so) with an extender
This works AWESOME for my shirt collar music player use
Currently, there are only a few companies that produce a shorter cord length model (Bose 'SPORT' IE2 is one
not the mobile version that I have)
The updated Sennheiser 685, unfortunately, no longer offers this option
Ultimately, I will keep these as a backup set for comparisons, casual listening around the house, and for airplane trips - the isolation and sound quality are worth the price
In terms of my every day work setup, I need to keep hunting for a better cord option
Next up, I am going to try these two sets, which I can see as having some trade-offs of their own:Sennheiser 685sPotential advantages over CX300s: more durable, better symmetrical cord split design
potentially shorter cord (can't tell from the photos)Most Likely Comparable: noise isolation, fit, and sound qualityPotential Downsides: Sound quality (sport design is water resistant which might lower sound quality) and cord length (compared to a short cord version)Bose SoundSportPotential advantages over CX300s: more durable, better symmetrical cord split design, shorter cord lengthMost Likely Comparable: Good sound quality (better than stock buds), all day comfort fitPotential Downsides: Higher price, Noise isolation (not fully in-ear), bulkier control module that I don't plan to use, subjective sound curve quality (I already know the MIE2 has an exaggerated mid-bass curve and less spacious sound)Sennheiser has done a good job delivering a great sound & fit for a modest price
Depending on your needs, the CX300's might be all the bud you need
A note to Sennheiser - if you upped the cord quality (stronger connection point, thicker wire, symmetrical split) and made it detachable at around 18", I would easily pay 2x for the same buds
It doesn't look like anyone (outside of Bose) is offering a well built quality bud with short cord
Shure used to have one priced around $100-200, but discontinued it as well
I am guessing there are plenty of active people using collar or armband players that would benefit from better cord management and appreciate higher sound quality
This is my fourth or fifth pair and for the money I think they're good
Lost a pair or two to wear and tear they're delicate so you cannot beat the crap out of them but think they sound great
Have tried Bose and expensive others and think these are better
They must be because my wife and son keep stealing them from me
Very good headphones
Great Headphones
Love the asymmetrical cord
Just accidentally left them in the pocket of a garment that went through the washer and dryer
Sill work beautifully
Wouldn't recommend doing that if you can avoid it, but good to know they withstood the water and heat and still work like new
Great sound
I have had many headphones in the past
It comes with a little bag which you can store the headphones inside which is extremely useful
very nice
What many dont realize is that Sennheiser make earbuds and headphones for certain things
They have earbuds/headphones for EVERYTHING, so dont buy a Sennhiser product and say, "But its not made for this" NO SHITE
They got headphones for Running, gaming, high quality, airplane cancelling, dj, studio, etc
I just hate those people who buy a Sennheiser product and complsin that its not made for a certain thing
Next time dont buy a high quality product and not do some research
Almost all if not all Sennheiser products are amazing
Great sound, durable, look good, really cant complain about much
They do tangle a bit more than my last pair of Sennheisers (I thought I had ordered the exact same headphones) because the material for the cords is less rigid, but that also means there's less of that weird vibration sound that gets picked up every time something touches it
These earphones sound great
Nice and clear without an overabundance of bass
The bass is still there, and it can still rock your ears depending on the music you play
The sound quality doesn't match its price, as you would think these would cost at lease double than what I paid for
The clarity in the music is astounding and I'm glad I chose these headphones
One thing I do have a slight problem with is that the right earphone is longer than the left side
I'm not sure where this design originated from, but I think it looks silly
Also, I like to fold my earphones the way I do my instrument cables, but the different lengths makes it somewhat difficult
Taking it out and putting it back in the included carrying bag is also a little bit of a hassle, but it is a great way to store your earphones so they won't get lost or damaged
Opened my ears to the world of hire quality audio
Clear, but a little too much treble and too little bass for me
Durable- my last pair lasted me a couple years
I like the asymmetrical cord shape and the earbuds fit great in my small ear canal- both factors that make these good for jogging
Maybe good if your music isn't very bass focused, like folk or classical, versus my heavy bass electronic music
Quality earbuds for an affordable price
Sound quality is great as I have expected
However, it gets me static shock every a few minutes in my ears
I use them to listen to music from my computer at work
Every time I get shocked my Windows makes 'hardware found' or 'hardware disconnected' noise
So I guess it's not only extremely uncomfortable for me, but also it's unhealthy for my computer
I have used many Sennheiser's earbuds and this is the second one that gets me shocks constantly
This time it's really bad, and I had to order another set of earbuds from another company
I would probably order Senheiser in the future again though
This will be my second set of these headphones
The first that I had for three years until I had them dragging out of my car door for several miles
That killed them
I like the way that these fit in the way that they sound
They have a very full sound and I have definitely compare them against other, more expensive headphones
In fact, some coworkers and I tried five different sets of headphones, and the is definitely came out on top
I also like the fact that they have very small dear inserts and medium and large
My brother in law who also has these headphones, uses the small ones, and I use the large air inserts
Both of us have been able to use these very comfortably
The other excellent heard about them is that they block out so, regardless of whether you are listening to music or not
The silicone of the ear insert is also very comfortable for long term wearing
I happen to have large ear holes (har har) and they fit great
I look forward to my second set
Sennheiser earbuds are renowned  for having great sound and build quality
The CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass earbuds should render the same sentiments right
Let us look closer at this pair of earbuds and see what the evidence renders
Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass EarbudsI recently found myself in need of a pair of new earbuds
But with a limited budget and wanting to spend no more than about $50 I wasn’t sure what I would get for my money
So I got online did a little googling research and came across Sennheiser among others and decided to take a closer look at these for consideration to purchase
I read quite a few reviews on this set o earbuds and I felt confident I had a good understanding as to what these would offer me for the money
For the most part I was satisfied with what I heard about these in all of the reviews I took a look at
So just how exactly did that turn out for me
I placed my order for these Sennheiser CX 300 II  Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds and crossed my fingers
A few days thereafter I received them in the mail
I opened up the box unpackaged them and was immediately pleasantly surprised and disappointed at the same time
Although it’s true that among the reviews I had read the items that I was disappointed with once the product was in my hands I had hoped were only limited opinions and not fact but this was not the case
As mentioned in other reviews the wires on each individual in your blood are pretty thin
They almost give you the impression that they could easily tear in some manner or another if pulled hard or caught on something unaware
I would not recommend being too aggressive with these for this very fact the wires are then
Another point mentioned in other reviews with the fact that one wire for the right earbud is considerably longer then the short wire of the left earbud
The reason for this as it was described is so that the headphones can be maneuvered around the back of the neck so as to keep the wires from dangling in front of you if they were placed normally in front
I have to admit I found this to be rather annoying and I did not find it a pleasing feature of these headphones all and to be quite honest with you they appear to look a bit awkward because I do not wear them behind the neck as the extended length of the right earbud would suggest
And just for exercise I did place these around my neck to see how they would fit feel while listening to these earbuds and I found it to be distracting
There are  some pros and cons with regards to the Sennheiser CX 300 II  Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds that are worth mentioning to any potential buyers, and they are As follows:Pros: For the budget minded shopper of earbuds; First, a pair of earbuds that have good volume in sound
second, are light weight and attractive in appearance
third, have the 90� angle plug to prevent damage
Fourth, great sound reproduction so long as the earbuds or properly nested within the ear canal
Cons:  For the discerning minded shopper of earbuds;  first, the wires to each individual earbud are fairly then
Second, due to the fact that the wires to the earbuds are very thin they are very susceptible and almost always tangle up especially when they are put into their pouch for storage
Third, I do not recommend these earbuds for any type of sports activity
I find as a cyclist that these earbuds often come out of place enough to break the seal between the  the earbud and the ear canal so that you  often have to readjust fitment and may find this to be very irritating
To sum things up I’m happy with my purchase for a few reasons
First, they sound incredible
For less than $50 these headphones produce great sound
The highs are good the  base reproduction excellent, and the midrange is fair
Second, the two main things after mentioned are small niggles  that I am able to overlook because these offer great value for the money you pay
The Sennheiser CX 300 II  precision enhanced base earbuds are definitely worth considering taking in account all that’s been said in this review before making your purchasing decision
Okay so here is the device that I used to base my review on: a fourth-generation iPod touch
The main genres I listen to are Rock ‘n Roll (AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, etc
)  R&B (Isley Brothers, Craig David, Prince, etc
)  Classical, and Jazz / Blues (B
B
King, David Sanborn, Pinetop Perkins, etc
) as well as audio books
I am happy to report that all have performed well
Although I  do not listen to rap music I suspect that  these Sennheiser earbuds  will do just fine
Sadly, I would have given these a 5 out 5 star rating were it not for the uneven earbud wires and more importantly the thinness of them
Best head phones for the price
Best earbuds they have great bass and there cheep
These earbuds seem to be indestructible
very good sound quality and they resist almost any damage (within the reasonable haha)
Totally recommended
These headphones are a huge step up from the SkullCandy ones I'd been using for years
Great sound overall
Loving these
As a long-time owner of Senny cans, wanted something less conspicuous for public listening
Not missing anything I want to hear
This is the second time I'm purchasing this item (as a spare)
In my opinion, it's the best quality you can get at this price
one ear bud stopped working after 6 month
Do not recommend
Great sound, a little too snug
These headphones have good bass and overall good sound for their price
However, I have bought them about 2-3 times so far and each time they have broken after less than a year of use
The headphone jack seems to be the main issue as the wire is not glued to the jack and therefore tears out if it gets pulled on enough, which happens in regular use
It has gotten to the point where I am reluctant to get another pair due to the bad design
I know that there is disagreement on if the J cord or Y cord is better, I'm certainly on the J cord side of that
I like the ability to just pop a headphone out without it falling to the floor
I used to be a Sony loyalist because they made the best J cord headphone, but their quality has slipped in the last 2 years
The Sennheisers a great build quality, and the cord is better than the Sonys ever were
However, the audio quality is a little uninspiring
Sony's old MDR line was half the price and sounded better, but there are the best I've found for sale now
If they dropped the price like 20% then I would be singing their praises
Poor quality
Treble is way to high and there is no bass
So how can you advertise as "Bass Earbuds"
False advertising
I bought these as a gift for my son, was so impressed with the aesthetic and the overall performance, bought a pair for myself
Outstanding low end bass and crisp high tweeter sound
Better than most of the others I've tried that cost 2
5 times as much
Highly recommend
Great sound and fit
Works well with my Tune Belt also
great headphones for the price
aboslutely love them
The sound quality is amazing
excellent
Good basic buds - fit well in the ears and deliver solid bass notes and an even range - a mid priced good performer
They arrived exactly on time and are very fun to wear
They're good for audiophiles like me who enjoy wearing very nice earphones and want to get the good amount of sound for something cheap
I highly recommend this
Outrageous Sound at a Bargain price
For this price, I haven't found a better option earbud
Easy buy, great Quality for the price
The quality of the product is great
Sounds amazing
The design would be much better if the length of the individual ear bud was either equal or the longer one was reduced
It is just too long and constantly hangs in what seems like the wrong place
When wearing these, there is pressure on the shorter ear bud causing it to seem like it is being pulled out of my ear
It matches its price
For the average person, these will give you some really nice sound for such small speakers
If you are obsessed with good Bass like me, then 4 stars
It just doesn't quite give me the level of bass I crave
no
that I NEED
These ear buds sound great  and you cannot beat the  price
I had to buy 3 other pairs just to keep the kids from stealing mine
Nice quality but I expected a little more from Sennheiser
Their sound quality is quite good, and the build is quite great
The problem is that these tangle VERY VERY easily, much easier than even my cheaper earbuds
Having unequal cord lengths does not help this cause either
They are not perfect, but sound good
amazing beats quality sound in earbuds for a great price
these have amazing bass
11/10 would buy
Great sound, great sound
The price is good for the quality
You can always find better
if you want to pay the price but I think these are the best for this price range
Work very well
Works great, takes a little getting used to one cord being longer than the other, but couldn't ask for better sound for the price
Outstanding sound
Love that it wraps around the back of my neck and cords hangs to my side
Buds are right side for my small ear opening
I lost an old pair of Sony earbuds and tried to replace them with these
They're just okay, but certainly not an improvement over what I had
I like them well enough to keep them, wish they were better
I don't feel I get a good deep bass sound or crisp tenor
Broke the first week I had them--I have other very expensive Sennheiser  items and they are all great --very disapointedwith the earbuds--Amazon and Sennheiser
Very good product
They are comfortable and have good music quality
They are earbuds and they work
Sound quality a huge disappointment
Over 100 hours of burn-in and these sound thin, little midrange and no bass
Cannot recommend these, puzzled how they've gotten so many good reviews
Terrific value for money great sounding headphones
A bit heavy on the bass
So much better than regular ear buds
These earphones sound great
Nice and clear without an overabundance of bass
The bass is still there, and it can still rock your ears depending on the music you play
The sound quality doesn't match its price, as you would think these would cost at lease double than what I paid for
The clarity in the music is astounding and I'm glad I chose these headphones
One thing I do have a slight problem with is that the right earphone is longer than the left side
I'm not sure where this design originated from, but I think it looks silly
Also, I like to fold my earphones the way I do my instrument cables, but the different lengths makes it somewhat difficult
Taking it out and putting it back in the included carrying bag is also a little bit of a hassle, but it is a great way to store your earphones so they won't get lost or damaged
Opened my ears to the world of hire quality audio
Great Sound
Love the sound that comes out of these earbuds
Great price, wonderful, full sound
GREAT buy
Great for running
I love them, nice sound and verry confortable
I can sleep whith them with out any discomfort
These have very good bass output but are just too harsh in the upper midrange/treble
Clarity is good but the harshness kills the overall sound
Comfort is very good
Build quality is nothing special
The asynchronous cable design (one side longer than the other) is cumbersome and unnecessary
This is trash
To me, they are excellent, and more than worth the price
I wear them for 2-3 hours a day, and am never uncomfortable
Sound is excellent, as you would expect from Sennheiser
I could not believe the difference from my old, generic ear buds
They sound good, great bass, good highs, block out noise
I have Bose noise canceling headphones but they get too bulky sometimes on planes and make my ears hot
These are small, discrete and block out a decent amount of noise
May not be as good as some other ear buds on the market, but they certainly pull their weight when it comes to bass reproduction - which is what i was looking for
If you want excellent quality sound these are definitely what you are looking for
Excellent sound, I do wish there was more bass
I don't like the fact that there is no volume control or mic on the headphones
I also don't like the fact that one cord is longer than the other
Make them the same lenght
These are the best earbuds that I have ever owned
The sound is excellent and it has lasted me for a little over a year
No other earbuds that I have ever owned lasted that long
This thing has totally paid for itself and I am very satisfied
This is the second pair of Sennheiser CX 300 I have bought
I had the first pair for 3 years and was extremely happy with them (I'm sure they would have lasted even longer had I not used them while walking in the rain, thrown them in my backpack etc
) When they finally did break I ordered a new pair the next day
The sound quality, comfort and price of these earbuds is unbeatable
They are perfect for someone like me - a student who enjoys listening to music while studying (up to 7 hours a day so comfort and fit is important
), but doesn't need professional equipment
I tried several different Skullcandy earbuds before I found these and they are not only often more expensive, but they break so much faster and the sound quality is not even comparable
Let me start off by saying that I like to think that I have a pretty good ear for good sound, and I do my research before I buy anything electronic
I'm a college student, and like many probably know, its essential to have a good pair of headphones in your backpack at all times
Before switching to these I had been sticking to cheap best buy brands (think skull candy and iPhone headphones) and figured it was about time that I got some real headphones
I bought these last September and haven't looked back since
These are an excellent sounding headphone for the price, and have been surprisingly durable over the last year
I lot of reviews I read before purchasing these complained about the thinness of the cord, and while its true that the cord is especially thin, if you treat these headphones well and keep them in the included case when you aren't using them they should last just fine
I honestly don't think there is a better deal on quality sounding ear buds out there
Highly recommended
perfecto, suenan perfecto
perfect noise cancellation, bass seems to be perfect and not too much
Able to deliver the various music notes very clear & specific
Ear bud of various size is also a good option we have in this one
Design also seems to be perfect and gives elegant look
Have been using it from past 4 months
Overall its worth for money
Decent sound, but extremely uncomfortable
Awkward to insert into your ear and keep it there, and the rubber earpiece moves around and squeaks when you move around or walk
It's a Sennheiser and you get exactly what you expect
Sounds crisp with perfect bass and feels light in your ears
Best earbuds I've ever had
Great sound quality
Unfortunately after 2 months one ear stopped working
It has a short already
great headphones for the price
aboslutely love them
The sound quality is amazing
excellent
Decent headset
Survived 2 rounds in my washer and dryer
Cord length after the joint is extremely asymmetric
Bass is extremely high
Not worth the price at all
In all the reviews I never read anything about one side being 1ft
longer then the other
Anyway you try to wear them the "V" where the 2 chords join into 1, is up by whatever ear the short side is on
Impossible to even wear unless your sitting or laying down
I have had multiple earbuds over the years and have never seen this design
It is the worst design I have ever seen in my life
Doesn't matter if the sound is the best ever put into a set of earbuds
p, you can't wear them
Went straight back to Amazon
As far as ear buds go these are fine-have a problem keeping anything in my ears
Very good earbuds
Cord is too short to be practical for computer or handheld use and one side is longer than the other
Sound quality is ok but the bass and max volume is pretty disappointing
Headphone jack has an annoying L shape design that ripped after extremely infrequent indoor use
Customer service was the worst of it
They wanted me to make an account on *their* website to replace their terrible product
No company does this
Ever
Way too expensive for a pair of earphones that don't even have a mic
One side has a much longer cord
Bass is good but not skull thumping
High needs to be broken in
Really nice balances left and right sound wise
Great sound and nice, comfortable fit
Not sure about one side cable shorter then the other, but can live with it
Did I say they sound great
Great Bass, clear sound
No complaints
+ it's fairly cheap
Not as great as previous Sennheiser headphones I have bought in this price range
These earbuds get the job done
Great sound, great bass, great comfort
The short wire on the left earbud is a little weird, but you get used to it quick
For $35 these earbuds are amazing
Best pair I've ever owned
Pros: -Sound -BassCons: -Short Left Wire
The quality is great for the price
Unfortunately, I've had two of these eventually die
All ok
My headphones do not work, the left instrument sounds much lower than the right
I want the wanrranty
What can I do
Terrible wrap around design and poor ear piece design make for a pair of headphones that constantly fall out and the sound quality isn't impressive enough for the price
I bought these earbuds last year, and they sound awesome
I was recommending them to everyone, but just a few days short of a year of owning them, one of the earbuds stopped working, which is annoying
The left works perfect, but the right has no sound at all
Waiting for an email from sennheiser because they are supposed to have a 2 year warranty, but it has been awhile
Will update review after RMA process is done
Nice ear buds, base is better than I thought possible for a product in this price range
I am so happy I bought these
I can't believe they were originally just $79
00
The sound is so clear
I can hear instruments and vocals on familiar songs that I never heard before
The bass is perfect for me
Since I was replacing my Sony earbuds (cost $29) that have the best sound of any I've used before, I was hoping to get the fullness of sound I was accustomed to (lots of clear bass)
Since I was unable to find the Sony model for sale anywhere, I began reading reviews with "bass" as the key word
This Sennheiser sounded like a good bet, especially considering one glowing review by some guy who seemed to "know his stuff" on audio matters
(He listed several models of different brands he owned that cost literally hundreds of dollars
) Unfortunately, my Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds fell woefully short of the experience I had with my previous Sony buds
I finally decided that what I got was not really a Sennheiser product, but instead a knock-off made in China
I am very unhappy about that
I would not have bought these buds for anything over $12 if I had known the audio quality before purchasing
PS I was very sick last month (the possibly bogus buds didn't help)
So it's too late now to return them by the deadline
I'm going to be mad at Amazon and this seller for a very long time
Poor quality sound
Rattles when you walk and talk
Amazing quality sound for a great price
This is my second pair - the first pair I bought elsewhere - and I love it
Blocks out ambient noise while delivering clear, crisp, bass sounds
This review is mainly a comparison between the Klpisch klipsch s4i  and the Sennheiser CX 300 II
Both are IEM's in my opinion are good, however at this price point CX 300's are just as good if not better than the S4's
They are very bassy out of the box and as with the S4's some amount of burnin is required for them to really sound at their peak
Right now the mids sound a bit muted but the bass is clean and very distinguishable and the highs are crisp and tight
That having been said both are great but at $32 vs the $60-100 price point for the S4's Sennheiser is the definitive winner
Very disappointed because I bought these in June and just yesterday the wires inside the cord broke at the connector that goes into my phone
I used these every day because I am a big fan of audio books since I never seem to have time to read a book
I figured for the price they would have lasted a little more than 3 months
The only reason I gave it two stars is because the sound quality was very good
I've bought these earbuds twice now from Amazon
I am a part-time DJ and an avid gym rat and I highly recommend these earbuds for listening on the go
They aren't performance-level but the sound quality is great and if you like bass in your music, this definitiely enhances it
I've purchased other Sennheiser products for working out but these fit a little better than the over-the-ear ones and involve less work to keep the wires still while you run or work out
I will say that the left ear tends to give me equalizing issues a couple years of use but I don't know if that's an earbud or wiring issue
If you take care of them and wrap them properly after use, I don't see how they wouldn't last you years
The wires are durable but the audio jack and earbud wire sheaths can get cut easily, so watch how you handle them (aka, don't yank them out of bags)
I love these earbuds
They fit the ear snugly and don't slip out
I prefer them to the monster iBeats, which are more expensive
They have a great sound as well, and do a nice job of blocking out external noise
I will continue to buy these earbuds whenever I am in the market for a new pair
Good quality and pretty good sound
crystal clear sound
not too much on bass
but its good
i love the clarity even at low volumes on this headset
it is ok for sweaty workout as long as you find a size ear cushions that fits better
Nice ear buds, base is better than I thought possible for a product in this price range
I am so happy I bought these
I can't believe they were originally just $79
00
The sound is so clear
I can hear instruments and vocals on familiar songs that I never heard before
The bass is perfect for me
Smooth transaction; no issues; would buy again
The sound is good
But I have lost it
too small earbuds, and lower quality than i expected
not worth 32 doller
I'm very pleased with these buds
The sound is excellent, the fit is secure, and it cancels noise really nicely
I've used them on my motorcycle and could hear the chord ring at the end of "A Day in the Life"  for the full 40-some seconds
my standart samsung earphones sound better than this, mid tones normal,bass not bad, but treble so faaaar to be perfect :(
Excellent sound quality for my needs, I am primarily a Rocker so I love the bass in this Sennheiser model
I use a Sony Walkman 2 Mp-3 player primarily, and these are the only earbuds I actually have to turn the volume down on
They are also great for gaming and I have used them with both my Laptop and my Desktop gaming PC's when my head phones quit
I almost took an egg off due to one of the sides shorting out after a year and 4 months, but Sennheiser's replacement policy is second to none
They sent me a brand new pair after I sent the receipt copy and a brief explanation of the issue
I have owned several models of Sennheiser earbuds over the years and would highly recommend most, but especially these puppies
very comfortable, though I didn't realize the cord for one ear bud would be shorter than the other, which I am not fond of
These are great headphones for the gym or just walking around
The sound is pretty good as long as you're not some sort of audiophile
Even then, they're pretty good for earbuds
Very durable, I've thrown them around and slept in them for nearly a year now
Great stuff
The BEST headphones out there
Reduce background noise completely
The only brand of headphones I will ever buy
Going from the Skull Candy and JVC Marshmallow garbage they sell at Walmart to these was like winning the lottery in every way
Sound quality and especially the FIT are far superior
They're good earphones, but I just want to know why where the wire splits into two earbuds one side is twice as long
I have had these headphones for some time now and I appreciate them even more today
They do not give a complete experience on the lower end but this does not usually get in the way of my favorite genres
They are exquisite on the higher ranges and unless you keep only the highest music formats (>256kbs) you will never feel restricted by these
These headphones stay in my pocket whenever I travel
Very strange configuration
one ear strand is only about 8" long while the other is twice that length
I've never seen anything like this on a set of ear buds
I'm sure they sound fine - as long as you don't mind looking like a buffoon wearing them with the yoke dangling 8" below one ear
Has anyone else experienced this
Were mine defective
I sent them back
The sound is very good, quality is good
perfect sound
Couldn't be happier with these
Good sound, clear highs, deep lows, almost no adjustments needed to your equalizers, but the asymmetrical is very awkward and can be hard to manage
Work and sound great
I do not recommend
The left earbud cord is more then one foot shorter then the right side
There is no way to correct it and it makes for a rather awkward situation
The sound is okay but I do not recommend the purchase
Do not feel like the hassle of returning, just wish people could make products correctly
These earbuds are decent
Like one reviewer said, they're not the best for running
Since one side is longer that the other, it's inevitable that the shorter side gets pulled out with any little snag
The sound quality is fine, although I didn't notice it as being spectacular like some people claim
work well
After class I went to a bar which is known to attract grad students from the nearby university
It got louder than usual and I put my new noise canceling headphones in, finally excited to use them for the first time
But my music seemed to just blend with the cacophony of noise
I was so annoyed, and couldn't focus at all, and wondered how anyone could study this way
When I took my headphones out I realized I had put in my old headphones on accident
After switching these headphones in I could hear some mumbled sounds but when I played my music it was perfect, I could study as if I was in the library
How did I ever survive without good headphones
So good I bought a second set
crap
These headphones would receive 5 stars for sound - if they worked for more than a few months
I purchased these in May 2014 and the left earbud has already stopped working
I doubt this is a fluke since this is the second pair I've purchased and had break in the past year (same issue with left ear bud malfunction in both pairs)
Wish I was able to return or exchange
Good headphones, as good as Beats, for half the price
I was skeptical about the reviews, but I'm pleased with the purchase
The sound is pretty good and the fit is nice and comfortable
It's a fairly good deal for the price and I have recommended them to others who are interested
These headphones sound great
Too bad that the headphones I received seem to have an issue where the left earphone is a lot quieter than the right earphone
Compared these to my crappy JVC Marshmallows they blow them away in audio, but my JVC's have equal sound in each of the earphones
Which makes me sad because these could sound phenomenal
I would've liked to exchange them, but not thinking anything would be wrong with them I ended up throwing away  the packaging
If you can get a pair the has equal sound in each earphone these will sound amazing
Good sound, fair price, good fit
Blocks out other sound at the gym
I like the smallest set of rubber tips
They fit my ear canal the best
Very good earbuds
The bass is so rich
It's like you are in a studio
I'm glad with my purchase
Great sound, great value
Sound quality is superb, but I hadn't realized how LONG the cable for the right headphone is to the left
It's OBNOXIOUS
Great sound with affordable price
These earphones are great for anybody who enjoys bass emphasized music
The bass is not too overpowering but instead it is very strong and deep
The mids and highs are definitely not sacrificed by the bass either
The overall volume output of the earphones is impressive as well for how small they are
My only complaint is they only lasted about three months for me before there was major distortion in the left earphone
This was due to the fact that I used them daily for an average of six hours a day while doing manual labor and going to the gym and I'm sure it was caused by mistreatment
I am about to order a second pair because it is hard to get such good all around quality in headphones at this price
A surprising high quality of sound and I do mean surprising
I bought these to use in the gym and after plugging them into my iPod I was elated and you cannot go wrong for the price
They do block out a surprising about of sound and if you have loss less or flac files you'll be over joyed by the quality
I can't harp on the surprise enough, BIG sound with a small and affordable package
It was broken in two week but the sound quality is amazing
These are great earbuds
I used to own a pair of similar Logitech Ultimate Ears at the same price-point, and these sennheiser's are much better
I like pairing them with foam tips, gives even more of a bass and full sound
One weird thing though, which is why it gets 4 stars: the cord for the right ear goes around the back of your neck
You pretty much have to use them this way, because the cords are not equal length and one is designed to go around the back of your neck
It takes some getting used to
Great bass in it without pressing the other frequencies
As a bass player, this was absolutely what I had looked for
And now it is on my hand
Even without burning it in, it really packs a punch, i am looking forward to do a burn-in and see what these naughty buds can achieve
To conclude, go for cx300
The fit is absolutely horrid, it falls out of my ear even while sitting
Don't get me started about working out with them
The sound quality isn't bad
The mids can be drowned out at time
I recommend the klipsch image s4 over these
I've got to say: I've been a huge fan of these since I received my pair
They've lasted me a while so far, and I cannot see any wear and tear damage on them yet - even from daily use over the past few months
These ear buds turned out to be as good as the reviews said they would be
Excellent sound including deep base
Simple as that
I really wanted to like these earbuds
Sound quality is excellent
Not sure if the buds I received were 'irregular', but one side is shorter than the other, which is annoying to me
Perhaps that is why the price was so low
I gifted them to a family member who didn't mind the off size length
Still looking
Did not meet my expectations
I will start off by saying these came in the mail very quickly which was very satisfying as my previous pair of earbuds had broken
(Creative EP-630i) Now, the cords for these are asymmetrical, meaning that you put one bud around your head to your ear
This was foreign to me as every audio device I had were the traditional two-cables that hang in front of you
I was skeptical about it at first, but learned to quickly cope with it and even prefer these style of cords
It fits and feels perfect in my ears
These earbuds exceeded my standards
Pros:- Amazing sound quality- Great bass- Looks great- Has a very professional feel- Comes with a fancy little pouch (no more alien tangles in your pocket
)Cons- Wind can be heard- Must pull out phone every time you want to change a track
Very good look, sounds clear yet not the best
Fantastic for the price
These Sennheiser CX 300 II Earbuds are disappointing in several respects: (1) muffled bass--the bass is boomy and poorly defined, (2) very underemphasized mids/highs--vocals sound very far away and lack clarity
Informing the foregoing comments is my experience with (1) circumaural headphones--Panasonic RP-HTX7, which retails for just around $20 and a pair of well-regarded Sennheiser HD595, (2) Samsung earbuds pre-packaged with a Galaxy phone
Even the free samsung earbuds seem to have greater audio fidelity, although their low-end is wanting
In sum, these earbuds are good exercise headphones because they isolate noise adequately, but their performance audio-wise is simply mediocre
This conclusion is largely consonant the impressions of this headphone on such online fora as Head-fi and Audioholics
My grandson Boppys and said they were quite well
I get a terrible hissing sound when using these ear buds
I bought them for use with my Roku 3 remote
I have not had any issues with other ear buds connected to the remote device
I also get a hissing sound when plugged into my Samsung Tablet and iphone
I am a HUGE Senn fan, and am surprised at the poor quality of these buds
I expected much more
Poorly designed package, while attempting to open lost one of the extra ear tips
Product looks and feels of poor quality like a $7
98  earphone
RETURNED
Good price, nice headphones
I think this is my third pair of these
The last one wore out after 4 years of constant use
You can't go wrong with these
Comfortable and durable and sound quality is as perfect as I require
Makes music so much more enjoyable
These earbuds have so much power for their size
Sound is so precise, so clear, so clean
Bass is full sounding considering the size of these
Can almost be compared to my studio beats
I actually bought these to have something to work out in and just use when I'm walking around campus because my beats are so big and bulky (and hard for working out in)
I also bought these for the two year warranty because every earbud I have used breaks within 3 months
Just hoping that amazon honors the 2 year warranty if something does happen
The only cons that I found with these is that you can't turn the volume up very loud because the high tones hurt my ears
But honestly you don't need to turn the volume up very loud because they are very full sounding
I am also concerned with the thin cord, but hopefully this won't be an issue
Overall this is a high quality product, with awesome sound quality
Do not buy these  I'm very disappointed
The bass is not nearly as good as the product boasts
The range is simply awful, and the fidelity is virtually non-existent
I wanted to upgrade from my current EarPods, and they have proven to be far better than these
I was buying these as an intermediate upgrade until I could afford the Bose QC 20 earbuds
These may be good for those of you who have never owned a good pair
They are a cut above most other $10-$20 earbuds out there, but for their price, and when they were so highly praised in the description, these are utterly trash
I'm not even gona bother to return them
I'll just give them away and go back to my old, better, Apple Earpods
I have previously purchased Sennheiser products, previously the 200 series
I decided to upgrade slightly to these (the previous ones were fantastic, but wore out)
These are amazing
Beautiful clear bass and sound
Again, only slight complaint is no microphone or volume control, but you know exactly what you're buying with these
Please note the very cool ergonomically enhanced design that accompanies these earphones: wrap the right earbud behind your neck for ideal results
Highly recommendable
Good headphones
Shockingly good sound switching from normal ear bud style with good bass an isolation
Isolation is so good I have to really watch for traffic
I have hada few good "yanks" on the cable and no faiures yet so the thin wires are pretty durable
The cable rubbing others mention is annoying but can be remedied with a clip to the collar
That is my only complaint is that it did not come with the clip
I run in hot weather and have not had the slipping out of the ear issue  so no complaints there
Good buy at a great price
I am not happy with my ear buds because they don't fit good and I am thinking of returning them
These headphones are so dope, great quality
I love these earbuds
I've always used the cheap $5 earbuds you might buy at Walgreens, but I decided to upgrade to these, and it was absolutely worth it
They put out a great, strong bass and have a great range
They feel sturdy and well made, I've had no issues with the wires stripping or the audio cutting out
Although I love them, I had to remove a star because of two things: the first being that they're very finicky in staying put in your ears
I've tried all three sizes, but only one seems to work at all, and that's only 80% of the time
Also, while I could see some people enjoying it, I personally dislike the asymmetrical design
I decided not to remove an additional star for this, because I see it as more of an opinion rather than a design flaw
Overall, these are great economy earbuds that easily compare to more expensive, higher-end earbuds
They're okay
I have no idea why the right wire is so long
Thats my only complaint
But for sound quality, its just fine
It has rich bass but its not the best
Great headphones
My first impression is that it is not worth the price and the hype
I specifically bought this item based on a few detailed reviews comparing these to other high end headphones
The most obvious problem is the loud static noise
This should be a basic functionality that you expect a $10 headphone is great at, much less one with $70 MSRP
A strong base (or delivery of any range for that matter) is worthless if you can't filter the static
I tried different devices and in all of them I heard the loud static
hands down the best headphone purchase I've ever made
I wanted to buy something slightly more expensive but with much higher quality, and this was it
I finally broke the cycle of new headphones every 6 months with these
One full year strong and zero problems
Sound so great and strong I love it
Comfortable
like any normal earbuds so nothing impressive about itBass is okey but not like i expect but to be honest it's still better than a lot of other earbuds in store with same price
at the end all i can say that i like it and i'm gonna buy another one for my brother
Good quality & Price = Good Deal
Just got these today
I can honestly say they are the worst headphones I've ever owned
I understand that they are probably made for IEM (in ear monitors) but the fact that the right headphone chord is much longer than the other one makes them super inconvenient to work out with
Not to mention the bad audio quality
Bass boost is kind of like turning the bass all the way up in your car with no subwoofer, just sounds muddy
Don't buy
Nice sound
Shockingly good sound switching from normal ear bud style with good bass an isolation
Isolation is so good I have to really watch for traffic
I have hada few good "yanks" on the cable and no faiures yet so the thin wires are pretty durable
The cable rubbing others mention is annoying but can be remedied with a clip to the collar
That is my only complaint is that it did not come with the clip
I run in hot weather and have not had the slipping out of the ear issue  so no complaints there
Good buy at a great price
I am not happy with my ear buds because they don't fit good and I am thinking of returning them
These sound terrific BUT: They come out of the ear fairly easily and would be useless for exercise or running
There is significant cord noise also if you are moving a lot
If you want something inexpensive for exercise you will like the Panasonic RPHJE120 for less than $10--a steal
You have to tug them out of your ear and they sound almost as good but different
The Sennheiser's are quite bright, have a mellow bass and are slightly deficient in the treble somehow
Don't get me wrong--they make Apple ear pods sound like dog doo or like a very large feather pillow was removed that was blocking the sound
If you want the cymbals to really sizzle, I think you need to spend a LOT more money
Unlike some, I love the case which is like an old-time coin purse and has a springy opening that is extra user-friendly
Send me yours if you hate it
These buds have a short cord to the left ear and a much longer cord for the right ear
Why
God only knows
It is a pain, but you can work with it for this quality at this price
Awesome set of headphones they sound great lots of bass I even accidentally put them through the wash last night and they still work 100% and sound the same as well
The sound clarity is impeccable, the mids come through crystal clear and the bass is there and powerful
They really do have a good bass sound, but its also very clear without sounding muddy
I've had and listened to phones that cost 9 times as much and really can't say those sounded any better
Definitely a good value
Good va
sound great, use them everyday
Very good
I expected it to be better
The ones my friend had sounded better
Maybe I got unlucky
The headphone cord lengths are different so when you wear them like a normal person one ear bears all weight of the cord
This is especially annoying while working out since it virtually guarantees the shorter cord will get pulled out
I assume someone at Sennheiser designed this as a feature, but I can't tell what that feature would be
Like it or hate it, the product overview page does not list this "feature
" I happen to hate it
I love it
son loved them
Maybe my ears are small
Fantastic for the price
One minor gripe that may annoy some buyers is that the right headphone cord is twice the length on the left
The sound is good
The ear bud adapter thingies fit
These are okay things
However, the noise from moving the wiring around your neck, or shirt, or air, or looking at them will drive you a little looney
Especially if you listen to a lot of music or create music
They sound like they're unshielded
But hey, they're low on the price range
Outstanding, flat frequency response with good low end
I bought 2 pairs, the second for a backup
Amazing earphones
Good base
Annoying cord
Good price
great sound for such small earphones, especially the bass sounds are awesome
Very speedy shipment
Totally  cool speakers
Very good
highest quality headphones
I bought Sennheiser CX 300II from GadgeTimes on August-13-2014, It is shipped fast but the sound from left speaker is bigger than from right one
That is too bad
I don't expected the sound very good but at least the sound should balance between two speaker
I try to use it on some days but it is not better
I am extremely unsatisfied with the quality of material used on these
I have bought numerous Sennheiser ear buds and headphones over the years and these have by far been the worst
Not in quality of sound but in quality of product
The only time I use these ear buds are at the gym or on a bike ride so only a few hours per week
Within a months period they have already shorted at the plug to the point where they will not produce sound
I have another pair that lasted about a year and a half and it only has 1 ear bud shorted
I decided to buy these as a replacement and unfortunately my old ear buds are serving as a replacement for these
Worth the money, but definitely overrated
Just OK
Not Bose by any means
I have used these no less than 4 days a week for running, working out at the gym, and blocking noise at work and they are STILL GOING STRONG AFTER 2 YEARS
They get shoved in my purse or gym bag and I haven't lost the little rubber pieces, not had any issues with the wires
Thank you for making a product that is worth *every* penny
I just bought a second set to have on hand , because I know I won't be able to find another like these once they do give up the ghost
LOVE THEM
Base is great for the price
I really wanted to like these headphones, but I just couldn't
Coming from a pair of Klipsch S4's, I was looking for something that had a bit more bass to them
And while these do have bass, it comes at a price
The boomier sound made for a much more muddy experience over all
Maybe my ears are now biased, but to me there really wasn't very much detail in the sound of these ear buds
Not to mention I couldn't use them for any extended amount of time without my ears becoming sore
I ended up going with the Klipsch R6's instead and am much happier with them vs these
that bass tho
Good quality, it would be better  if more mid-tone sound
Fit good but sound cheap
Should be worth around $15-20
The sound of low-frequencies is fine, but sound of the high-frequencies is too bad
I really want to return it
I don't know I can or not
When these arrived, I was very excited
I took them out and started playing music immediately
Highs were sharp, barely any mids, and muddy bass
I read around that you should burn them in by playing music or random noise/frequencies to adjust the audio drivers
I googled "burn in pink noise" and let it replay the wav file at normal volume while I slept
The next day it sounded much more accurate
It's under much speculation if this is a scientific fact to work, but in my opinion, it made a huge difference
Just wanted to say the product shipped in 2 days and can't say enough about the quality of the product
Simply amazing
Definitely an upgrade over the normal ear buds that you find in your local store
I bought these to replace my older pair of Sennheiser earbuds
I was expecting the quality to be about the same but with the added bonus of being tighter fitting and thus providing passive noise canceling
I was shocked when I plugged them in for the first time; I actually had to turn the volume down
The sound is crisp and powerful and they block out all but the loudest ambient noise
They come with a carrying case and three sets of adapters to make them fit tightly in the ear canal
The only thing I do not like about them is the asymmetric cord, which is a matter of preference and my fault for not reading the item description
The plug is also a tiny bit large but seems fairly well made and durable
All in all they are well worth the price
I can't imagine ever buying/using headphones or earbuds made by anyone other than Sennheiser
This is an excellent replacement from standard ipod earphones
The bass will blow you away
Pros: Highs, Mids, Lows, Excellent
Its one of the best sennheiser product
Cons: None
I was so excited for a set of headphones from a seemingly reputable company, but things didn't turn out as planned:PROS-great sound-noise-cancellation (you can't hear a thing outside
whether that's for the better or worse
)-fresh, crisp audioCONS-headphone material seems crappily made-after JUST 2 WEEKS, the input plug side of the headphones detached
so the plug itself was hanging by a thread from the rest of the headphones
PIECE OF JUNK
-I'm not a big fan of the left headphone wire being 1/4 or 1/2 the length of the other side
it got caught on my clothes very easily, especially when working out or walking quicklyThis was bought from Amazon, not some 3rd party, so I expected more
I have sent out for a return on this defective, junk hardware set of headphones
But let me be clear, if you get a good set of headphones, sound quality/audio is great
These earbuds are just OK
They are not that much better or worse than any other earbuds I've had
So don't get your expectations too high
Revised 1/8/2012*** I should've broken these in more (whether or not you believe in burn-in), as it's certainly made a difference in sound
Response has definitely smoothed out and the bass is a little less fluffy now, perhaps a bit tighter
Due to the bass response being less overblown, highs are now easier to pick out in the mix
That being said, they're still lacking some of the finest details, but it's likely not noticeable to the average person
I feel they're a solid pair of in-ears and a very good value for the money
Likely one of the best in-ears for under $50
***I'm a lifelong musician who collects albums and has attended over a hundred concerts
Music is my life, so I'm very picky about my gear, especially headphones
That being said, I'm also not rolling in money, so value is a big consideration
Sennheiser is well known for their high quality microphones and in ear systems, so I decided to give their CX300 MK-II earbuds a try
This is a tricky review for me, as I'm not used to in-earbuds, rather the after market earbuds that sit just outside the canal (similar in style to the Apple stock buds)
Those provide decent treble, but no appreciable bass response or noise isolation
That being said, I'm still getting used to being "plugged up" with these earbuds, so bear with me
To be fair, I had to listen to several music samples and genres with various EQ settings
Sometimes an 80's song would sound phenomenal, but a newer song with more modern bass response would sound too 'fluffy
' The CX300s certainly have a smooth and warm bass response, however the bass response itself is highly dependent on the fit on the earbuds - I tried all three sleeves and prefer the middle ones
All are very comfortable to wear, but the smallest didn't provide the seal I needed
Bass is prominent through most of my music samples, but its important to remember what these things are - $30 earbuds
If you're expecting to be completely blown away, I suggest you pop for higher end headphones (expect to pay a higher end price for said phones)
The treble of course is the counter balance to all that bass, and therefore my only point of hesitation
The bass is so dominating that it requires you to play with EQ settings to find a suitable balance
I find even with an extreme treble boost on my Sansa clip, I cannot get the kind of treble sensitivity I'm used to with out-of-earbuds
It's not distracting by any means, in fact they sound very rounded and smooth and judging from the reviews, many here are happy with the sound range
For me, it's all about what I can't hear anymore - I know there's more treble detail that the phones aren't expressing
Concerning the physical construction, the cord is a little on the thin side, and I will have to use care not to rough it up
The plug is also kinda obtrusive in that it juts out from my Sansa clip instead of hugging the unit (Im used to a smaller and more standardized 90 degree jack)
Having an asymmetrical cord does not bother me, as I usually place my headphones cords behind my left side already
In conclusion: Big improvement over the standard Apple stock buds, I think the average listener would be very happy
Good bass response from a nice set of headphones, but the unbalanced treble will irk some of those who consider themselves audiophiles or are otherwise strict in their expectations
Perhaps the response will change a bit after a few hours of burn in
If I notice any change I will come back and edit my post to reflect that
I've never been a fan of ear buds because, for some reason, they don't seem to stay in my ear
That said, I took a chance on these based on reviews and must say that the sound quality is better than I expected and certainly better than other ear buds I've tried - and there have been a few of them
There's more bass and the sound just seems to be clearer
They still don't stay in my ears for an extended period of time, but I'm convinced it's my ears, not the buds
So, they fit the job I bought them for, which is to let me hear music during my commute
For home use, I use over-the-ear Sennheiser HD 555s and they are great
After flying from LA to Chicago and struggling to hear my iPod music over the engine noise and passenger sounds (thanks, parents of screaming baby in 22F), I realized the iPod earbuds are kind of crap
Doing a little research, I found that most people have a lot of respect for Sennheiser's line of earbuds
This pair is pretty incredible
Not only do they have excellent sound reproduction with decent bass (for headphones), but they also do a fair job of blocking unwanted ambient sounds with their in-canal design
If you're looking for all of the above without breaking the bank, you could do far worse than these
PROS: sound great, very comfortable, good noise isolationCONS: Not appreciably better than the 7$ cheaper cx300 mk1'sgot these as a replacement for my old cx300s when after 2 years the cable broke somewhere in the elbow
I'd read some places saying that these were somehow better so I got them for the 7 extra bucks they cost
I've got to say that seems to be pretty much bs the cable went from a separable 2 wire flat type to a single round type, there is a bigger separator, I really don't perceive there to be any great quality increase there, the elbow got a little bigger and thus taller
that is kind of convenient for my application but it isn't necessarily an improvement
They did however lengthen the cord by about 5 inches which is good
Since my old pair only works in one ear not it is hard to make a good comparison of sound quality but it seems to be no worse then the old ones, maybe a little less focus on base more mid-high
All that said they do sound really excellent especially considering you can get them for 30$ and they are outrageously comfortable, I can wear then forever even sleep with them on without ever having any discomfort
If these last for another 2 years like the old ones I will be quite happy with themMay be worth saying that I did pay like 2$'s more to get these actually from Amazon them self instead of some other distributor through them so that I would be able to make claims on the 2 year warranty from sennheiser that these have and also in hopes of not getting a counterfeit pair (which I didn't)
GREAT
Just got my head phones
The bass hits just right it is crisp not over powering but not weak
These are very comfortable  earbuds
A lot of earbuds, at least for me bother my ears, but these are wonderfully comfortable
I recommend these earbuds to anyone who's looking for quality but, doesn't want to pay to much because they may need to buy more in a few months because they are lost or break
The sound is wonderful and the price is even better
The only thing is I did NOT receive a black carrying case, but I probably wouldn't use it anyways
No big deal
I have owned these for around 6 months now, and I can safely say they are my favorite pair of headphones yet
As soon as I took them out of the package I realized that one wire was longer than the other (wraps around the back of your neck), and was cursing myself for not having researched them more
I've always dreaded the offset wire layout
They do not come with the standard "Y" design
I have grown accustomed to the alternative design though
It is better in some ways, in that I can easily take the right earbud out of my ear to talk with someone and have it rest on my shoulder instead of it dangling freely with the "Y" design
However that is a minor aspect which I like about these earbuds
The sound quality is superb
I like a little bit of extra bass in my music
I don't listen to hip hop or rap or any music that is bass driven, but still, the extra bass is appreciated and not overwhelming
Highs sound great as well
I agree with some reviewers who claim that the mid ranges are "muddy"
After having listened to some songs for years, I now notice more subtle details in them which I never heard before
My music sounds crisp
Some people will claim that a certain pair of earbuds does not have great sound
A common cause is that they are not placing the earbuds correctly in their ears, or are using the wrong size bud
One should not have to stuff the earbud in the ear
The earbud should also not be putting pressure against the ear canal
Before I realized I needed the smallest bud size that came with my previous pair of Creative Labs earbuds, I was experiencing discomfort and could not listen to music for an extended period of time
I'm a big guy (6'3"), but I guess I just have small ear canals
These earbuds will sound wonderful if they are placed in the ear correctly
Sometimes they will be oriented so minutely different than when I previously wore them that I can hear even more detail in my music and it sounds even better
That will hold true for most earbuds
I consistently get a good sound though
The one complaint I have with them is that the wire kinks up a lot
It has gotten better since I took them out of the package months ago, but I still have to play with them to get the wire unstuck from itself
I take good care of my earbuds as well
I never bunch them up
I also cannot run with these in
They have a stethoscope effect so bad that I cannot stand it
If you listen to music while doing any movements equally or less physically stimulating than walking, these earbuds are for you
Overall I am very happy with them and will buy from Sennheiser again
Right now I am deciding between buying Sennheiser HD 595's or the PXC 450's
So I have been hunting around looking at reviews
I know how time consuming it can be to find the right pair, so I decided to help a fellow buyer out
I just bought this pair of earbuds near my work
They have excellent bass and low-mid range
My only beef is that the highs are muffled into the bass
You don't get much clarity out of the high hats and vocals
I re-purchased these exact headphones because of their excellent quality, after loosing my first set
The entire package comes with 3 different size rubber ends for the earbuds, a carrying case, and the buds themselves
The sound provides clear highs, mids, and lows
In terms of noise reduction, they do a great job
If you're in the office, or at home, and are using the earbuds with music on it will reduce all other environmental noises letting you focus on whatever you're listening to
It's great if you work in a loud office and need a moment of silence to focus on your work
I've had good luck using these at the office and on planes
They block out sound well (they come with three different sizes of earpieces, so they should accommodate most people) and have good sound quality
I bought these for my dad to use with his iPod, but ended up testing them out a few times
Compared to the CX200s that I personally own and use, the bass is much more dominant in the 300s and overall sound quality seems to be better
However, the same problem plagues these headphones like most others from Sennheiser
If the cord rubs against something or there's jerky movement, the noise transfers to the headphones and gets annoying quickly, but it's not a complete dealbreaker if you're like me and just crank the volume up
I went to Amazon to purchase an additional pair of Creative Earbuds
However, reviews for these earbuds were so outstanding, I took the chance and purchased this brand instead
Wow
When I am working out, I cannot hear any exterior noises
only the wonderful sounds from my Nano
These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used
They're so tiny, powerful and lightweight, I literally walk around with them plugged into my ears for 5 hours or more daily and I do not even notice they're there
(Not to mention falling asleep with them plugged in)
I bought these directly from the company after having sent a pair for repair
Those ended up being fakes, so no warranty
But the rep was nice enough to offer me a pair for $15 (the same price I had paid initially for the fakes which I loved so much), I didn't think twice
But instead of receiving the CX 300, I got the CX 300 II which sounded even better than the fakes, and with a remodeled, smaller body which made wearing them even more comfortable
I compare every headphone I buy to these
The sound quality is unbeatable for the price and I end up returning every other headphone I buy cuz I simply can't give these up
I just wish they had a mic for the iPhone
Pure excellence
First off, while they're working they sound fantastic
Especially given the price
I was sent a fake at first
Contacted seller, they then sent me a real one
One thing you should know - Senheisser gives a 2 year warrantee with their headphones if you buy them from "authorized dealers"
The sellers on Amazon however are not authorized dealers, and so you get no warrantee
That's particularly bad considering these earbuds tend to last no more than 2 to 4 months at most before they short out
Sadly buyers don't know about these issues when they buy from here and find out only after their earbuds die
Amazon should do better than that
I'm surprised to see that over a year after buying mine, the problems still exist
Sound quality is great for the price
Some of the best earbuds I've ever owned
Excellent highs and deep rich bass
Mids get a little lost so you may need to boost that on your device but thats easily done
Highly recommended especially for the price
I've had a range of headphones ranging from cheap to very expensive, and I'd say these are a good value for the price
Sound quality is good and blows away 'stock' headphones that comes with mp3 players
I bought these off Amazon from the seller Triplenet Pricing for around $30
I was worried about them being fake because I read the reviews and some people said they received fakes
The ones I got are not fakes, they are real Sennheiser's and they sound great and isolate noise really well
Got these to replace my Skullcandy Ink'd which keep breaking after a few months, hope these last a lot longer because they definitely sound better
Fantastic
The sound's quality is incredible
It fits in you ear, the quality of the cable is very good
I AM VERY SATISFIED
RECOMMEND
The audio quality is good for in-ear headphones - but the comfort of these headphones is unparalleled
The rubber padding is soft and provides a snug, comfortable fit in-ear, ensuring excellent noise reduction
Heartily recommend these great headphones
I've long been an ardent supporter of Sennheiser products
I've owned several models of their headphones, including: on-ear, circum-aural, and ear-buds
So, when I got my new iPod, I thought these headphones would create a perfect pairing
I was dramatically dissatisfied when I finally got the buds out and gave them the full-gamut tests
The sound imaging and frequency response is hyper-condensed, making for a muddy unclear listening experience
Additionally, the cordage is rather flimsy, along with the silicone ear-canal adapters
You'd be almost as well off spending $15 for a cheap pair of Sony buds
One pro: these are comfortable buds, even for protracted listening sessions
However, if you really wish to satisfy your sound desires, purchase either one of Sennheiser's "Audiophile" ear-bud models or the Klipsh S4's
My two cents
I bought this product and I am absolutely sure it is not genuine product
To be really honest, I do not really know how to rate built and sound quality as well as noise reduction because this is the first time I bought Sennheiser
It is for my boyfriend who loves listening to music
I am not really a music person though, but I do care if for original product
This product did not come in box as it should and more important thing is there is no manual warranty book which should be there because Sennheiser product Built-tough with a 2 YEAR warranty
I have read some reviews on other products and some said that they get fake stuffs
Well, I can not trust this site anymore
I have owned several pairs of the CX300's and loved them all
I typically get them for under $30 on sale but would pay more if I had to
The reason I have had several is that I either lose them on a plane or give them as gifts
I just completed a review of the Bose IE2 earbuds
and it wasn't pretty (2 out of 5)
I picked them up through an airline mileage program that was about to expire
wish I could return them and spend that $99 elsewhere
I know Bose is over priced but their headphones (QuietComfort 2) that I have are quite good - that's why I tried the IE2's
Bad decision
I am back to my trusty and great sounding Sennheiser CX300 for earbuds
I bought the Sennheiser CX-300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds
For me, I found the build to be excellent
The main plug & cord is of that thick, black, rubbery silicone material
Putting them in the little spring bag provided, they NEVER get tangled up
My old Sonys were forever tangling every time I used them
The cords to the ear pieces seem very sturdy
With three choices of rubber tips, I used the medium size and the fit was great & very comfortable
The sound is great & when I pumped up the bass, that was excellent as well
I bought these for twenty-five dollars after a five-dollar online rebate
At BB, they were sixty
What a deal
These are, without a doubt, the nicest & best quality earbuds I've ever owned and at an unbeatable price
If one of your biggest concerns is in the comfort category, specifically as you sleep while listening to music, these earbuds feel good enough with a regular pillow; but they work even better if your head is cradled within the "scoop" between the neck support and upper half of a pillow you can probably also get at an ergonomics store (not just a chiropractor's office)
My pillow is years old and has retained its shape
Why does this feel/work better
It's simply that as your head moves during sleep, you can easily, unconsciously smush your ear to the pillow in a direct enough way as to close down the route the music takes to your eardrum
Try pushing one earbud into your ear with your finger -- you can get the same effect
But that more open area of my pillow won't do that near as easily, thus all night long I can be relatively more assured I'm getting a complete balance of sound
Even if the nondisturbance of others isn't an issue, this method beats having a boombox on, because again, while on your side, one ear is naturally losing some of that balanced sound
With this very good earbud -- one not jamming your ear with pain -- you've got both sides covered
I had imagined the smaller tips would do me best but I was wrong
I have normal-sized ears and still they left too much of a gap
I was getting that high trebly sound but hardly any bass
Yet the larger ones still accommodate my comfort while on my side, as explained above
The neck pillow completes the experience
Good luck
I used to have a set of regular CX300s
These are WAY better
I don't know how other to describe it but it sounds like these buds are a foot away from my head
the stereo separation is INCREDIBLE
There is not one frequency range that I can hear that is lacking
I consider myself an audiofile
and for what you get for what you pay for, this deal cannot be beat
5 Stars NO DOUBT AT ALL
There are my first plug-in earphones and they work great
The sound quality is excellent and they come with different size ear plugs for best fit
Bass is excellent
They also do a good job in isolating extrior sounds, tried them on a recent flight and I very much enjoyed the music
As with an plug-in type of earphones, you have to insert them in a way that won't cause discomfort
Excellent value for the price, highly recommend them
This is one of my first Sennheiser products and would absolutely recommend it
Sound quality is unbelievable for their size, and I actually don't need full volume to hear the nuances of an album
Easy to slip in a pocket and lightweight to wear
Best for the price, far and away
I bought these because they were cheaper than best buys black friday deal, and im glad i did
Noting really special, at least nothing i felt that made these headphones stand out
They are on par with my $8 skullcany headphones
I've bought two pairs of these earbuds: one pair to keep by my bed and one pair to keep in my coat or backpack
They're great
I do have some higher-quality headphones that I keep by my computer, but these are definitely good enough for whatever I throw at them; and although they're durable enough to last a long time (e
g
, strategically-reinforced sections of the cord), they're also cheap enough to be easy to replace
It's hard for me to imagine a better "sweet spot" of price and performance
Also, the earbuds are a behind-the-ears design, which is FAR superior to the alternative
Major points there
I have been using the Sennheiser PX100 over the ear portable headphones for a few years, but decided to try something a little more compact to use on my commute
I love the PX100's comfort and audio qualities, and wanted to see how these little earphones would compare
They hold up pretty well in comparison, but with some minuses
In terms of the rendering of natural sound they do a very good job, with good balance (not too tinny nor bassy)
It's a very close match to the audio qualities of my beloved PX100s
The only thing I don't like is the fit of the headphones
My ear opening is small, and using the smallest size buds, I still have to force them into the opening to prevent them from falling out
Comfort is a slight issue as they are not the most comfortable earphones
Over the ear headphones are the best in that regard
However, for short trips on my commute, for the small size, and the sound quality, I'd say it's a good buy for the price
I've reviewed dozens of headphones from over-the-ear to in-ear, from $10 throw away buds to $400 studio quality--These are by far the best buds I've ever gotten for under $25
I used V-Moda Bass Freq, Klipsch Image S4, and iPod earbuds as my control groups
My caparison is on sound quality only
So, let me compare to each:V-Moda: The CX300 create a much cleaner and brighter sound
The bass is adequate, but isn't nearly as present; the V-moda can be a bit overpowering
This understated bass may be a good thing for some listeners
Personally I prefer bass quality over bass quantity
At basically the same price +/- $5--there is no comparison--CX300
Klipsch: These two are matched pretty well
There is a bit more punch with the Klipsch (I've heard many complain that the S4s don't "kick" enough, but I imagine they are kids looking for 12" sub-woofers in their ears)
Aside for slight differences in bass characteristics the sound quality/stage is very similar--that is to say "decent, but not great
" But at $25, who's complaining
This is where the Klipsch go down for the count
they're 3 x the price
Winner
CX300
iPod: Of course, the CX300 were superior in every aspect--what isn't
A bonus on these CX300s is that the 3
5mm jack in angled and reinforced, this is a nice feature as most cords short out at the flimsy connection to the jack
All-in-all the CX300 buds are about as good as you're going to find at the $25 price point--So go get a pair, or two
UPDATE: Dec 23--(2 weeks of use)I've been comparing these to my JVC Xtreme Xplosives and there are pros and cons:The CX300 are very clear and crisp with very nice staging
But, the highs can be a little tinny and overbearing
Also, the bass is clean but not deep and full
, it is "punchy," but seems a little "hollow
"The JVCs have a much more full and encompassing bass response, but the mids and highs are canned and less present; not nearly the same staging characteristics as the CX300
So, If you are looking for overall sound quality and staging, go for the CX300
If you are looking for more aggressive sound and more durable buds, look to the JVCs--It's kind of a "choose your battle" situation
Honestly, if you want to have your cake and eat it too, you should look to Shure, Etymotic Research or Ultimate Ears (though I think UE has very poor customer service)
Let me first start off by saying if you really want these headphones to melt your ears with its bass, you need a good equalizer
Itunes or iphone equalizer is not sufficient and will not produce great bass
I am running an Android phone rooted with CM7 with their DSP App settings with the bass setting set to "slight" and the sound effects set to "deep"
For me this produces the cleanest and deepest bass
( I know a lot of you may not know what I'm talking about but for those people that do, buy these headphones and run those settings or experiment for yourself)
For Android people who are not rooted you may want to look into the app "poweramp" they have a nice equalizer as well
I haven't tried any of the other android equalizer apps that are out there
For my laptop I use the Built in Beats audio equalizer, again Itunes is not sufficient for great bass from these headphones
I'm so amazed at how cheap these headphones are and how much bass they can produce
When compared to "ThinkSounds" bass enhanced headphones I would pick the sennheisers everytime
I also love how the wire wraps around the back of your neck  instead of having 2 long wires dangling in front of you and getting in your way
Sennheisers wires stay out of the way which allows you to be active and not have to worry about trying to clip the wire somewhere out of the way
For 20
00 these headphones really are a steal
I recently lost my first pair which I loved
To my surprise this second pair I bought has even better quality, a thicker Cord, better fitting earbuds for small ears and a magnetic leather carrying case
I ordered these when a pair of JLab JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (White) I had died on me
First thought was, "just buy some more" then I thought about those Sennheiser HD 202 II Professional Headphones (Black) I had in the office
I had to give their buds a shot
The price was right ($23) and they were in stock
When I got them I plugged them in and tried them out with various types of music and was pretty impressed
No audiophile here, but the music (basic ACC's & MP3's - from Ambient to Metal to HipHop) all sounded warm and cozy
These things are bass happy, as advertised
The highs weren't as piercing as with the JLabs, but everything seemed a bit cleaner and softer around the edges
If you don't like bass from buds that make you go, "Man, how do they do that
" don't get these
If you do you're in luck, buy these first before you spend major coin on those Beats by Dr
Dre Tour High-Resolution In-Ear Headphones from Monster these may fit the bill for a lot less and very little if any loss in sound quality
Just really getting into ear phone, ear buds
Recently purchased an I Pad 2 and my son loaned me a pair of  unnamed earbuds
All  I can see is a S on the end of each bud
I was surprised  at how good they sound
My family owns an  iMac, Mac Pro Book, two iPhones and four IPods
Also own one hellava home  theater system
High end Harman Kardon AVR coupled to a Klipsch RF 7  horn loaded speaker system in a 7
1 configuration, Oppo Blu Ray hooked up to a top of the line 50 inch Panasonic Plasma
The Klipsch 12 inch sub literally shakes the pics on the wall
You can feel the bass in the pit of your belly
All that that being said is just to establish I know a little about music and the potential of how it can sound comng from quality equipment
My musical taste are wide, but at heart I am a  R & B purest loving great and funky bass lines
I just opened and hooked the Sennheiser CX  300 II buds up to my IPad II
First impression is they don't sound any better than the buds  my son loaned me
What is annoying so far is they are itching my inner ear canal
The other buds don't do that
I just switched them out to recheck again they definitely itch, not a good thing
I do detect an improvement in bass and the tremble is too shrill
I can see ear fatigue coming already
I understand music is recorded across a broad spectrum using various techniques
When you factor in the time span of my music collection, late 1960s until now, one can see it takes versatility to handleball of the content
I can attest that while the music is playing you cannot hear anything outside
My wife was watching a DVD and I could not hear a sound
In fact the bass sound waves fooled me because I could feel them in my belly, but I could not hear anything
I am well aware of burn in as my Klipsch speaker system required it and indeed over time they sounded better
I hope this is the same with these buds
I am not saying they are bad buds at all
I am saying the verdict is still out
At the price point $24, Idon' t see a mistake
Time will tell and I will report my findings as objectively as I can
As promised have had time for burn in and yes they needed several hours of play time to do that
With that said I am a R&B fanatic
I love the bass runs in great R & B songs
These buds expose the  imperfections  in older recordings
However they handle the newer recorded music wonderfully
Listening to Michael McDonald's, I Second That Emotion is a treat
The bass is deep and clean, the midrange is good also
On the Temptations, Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Jamerisons bass licks are clean, but this is an old recording and these buds reveal the limitations of the equipment
I will definately purchase another pair of this brand
These are the most comfortable headphones I have ever used
They're so tiny, powerful and lightweight, I literally walk around with them plugged into my ears for 5 hours or more daily and I do not even notice they're there
(Not to mention falling asleep with them plugged in)
I bought these directly from the company after having sent a pair for repair
Those ended up being fakes, so no warranty
But the rep was nice enough to offer me a pair for $15 (the same price I had paid initially for the fakes which I loved so much), I didn't think twice
But instead of receiving the CX 300, I got the CX 300 II which sounded even better than the fakes, and with a remodeled, smaller body which made wearing them even more comfortable
I compare every headphone I buy to these
The sound quality is unbeatable for the price and I end up returning every other headphone I buy cuz I simply can't give these up
I just wish they had a mic for the iPhone
Pure excellence
First off, while they're working they sound fantastic
Especially given the price
I was sent a fake at first
Contacted seller, they then sent me a real one
One thing you should know - Senheisser gives a 2 year warrantee with their headphones if you buy them from "authorized dealers"
The sellers on Amazon however are not authorized dealers, and so you get no warrantee
That's particularly bad considering these earbuds tend to last no more than 2 to 4 months at most before they short out
Sadly buyers don't know about these issues when they buy from here and find out only after their earbuds die
Amazon should do better than that
I'm surprised to see that over a year after buying mine, the problems still exist
Shipping was fast and easy
Great sound, comfortable and fit in the ears perfectly
I would recommend them to anyone looking for great ear buds
These headphones are pretty much awesome
They provide clear sound, with a lot of bass
Some may say there is too much bass and it can muddy the sound, I don't think this is the case
I think the bass is perfect and it is often something headphones of this size and price are missing
Also, they are extremely comfortable, I wear them for almost 8 hours continuously and I experience almost no fatigue
Truly, the sound IS very clear and the price is great
But the sound is on the very high end of the sound spectrum, with virtually NO low, sweet bassiness
these were my first pair of higher quality headphones ever
I bought them about 4 years ago
I paid $50 for them
After hearing how awesome the sound was, I thought to myself "if these were only $50, I wonder how great the sound would be if I spent $150 or $300
"  And so I did
I bought the Sennheiser 595's (GREAT cans), I got the Monster Turbines, I got the Shur SLC2, I got the Sennheiser PX200's, and I got two other kinds of sennheiser earbuds which I ended up giving away to my girlfriend and brother
Don't get me wrong, all of these new headphones I experimented with were great
But I can honestly say that these are STILL my favorite all-around headphones
Matter of fact I am bumping some Radiohead in them right now
They are awesome for all kinds of music - incredibly balanced bass, superior sound quality, awesome noise reduction, everything you could possibly want
hip hop, classic rock, soul, jazz, blues, electronic are the styles of music I listen to most - great for all
I will say that you may want an alternative pair for the gym, as they are not perfect for running cuz of the cord
Other than that tho, I have used and abused the hell out of these things
I have stuffed them into so many pockets, duffle bags, computer bags, drawers, leave them in the car in the summer
You named it, I've done it with them and they are still perfect
hopefully you will all be as lucky as me and get a pair that lasts for a very long time
I just wanted to come on here and share that thought, as it just dawned on me while I was listening to some music how much I really do love these things, and how I still somehow always grab for these 7 times out of 10, even when I have an entire collection of great headphones to choose from
It could also be a comfort thing I suppose
they are easily the best fitting headphones I own
that is all
Sennheiser should be ashamed offer a product like this
With a quality name and high price I was expecting a quality product
Instead I received a cheap pair of headphones that sounded worse than they looked
I have a pair of extremely cheap Rocketfish headphones that I could swear were the exact same model with a different name
The sound is horrid, you may as well be playing telephone with a couple of tin cans and rope
Do yourself a favor and do not buy these headphones
Other reviewers have said that you need to break them in but for this price that is unacceptable
When placing the bud into your ear canal you can hear the diaphragm crackle
Bass does not exist
The bud is not comfortable and will not hold well in your ear because it is too short and fat
The carry pouch is cheap and lame
Ownership: 14 pathetic daysGet your headphones form a different company
There is no value to this product and I would not trust a single product from this company
Edit 11/14/2011: Discussion in the comments: It's possible I got a fake or counterfeit pair of Sennheiser headphones
I am not certain they were fake and will leave my rating as is
I have been using these earbuds for approximately 6 months and the L shaped connection from the cord to the the metal plug has just broken and sound is now only coming out of one earbud
It began coming loose about a month ago and sporadically I would lose sound in one of the earbuds
Now I can't get any sound from that earbud and the cord is almost completely detached from the plug
My last pair of earbuds (not Sennheiser) lasted approximately 4 years
The cord that wraps around the users neck (as these are asymmetric earbuds) was too long also
Very disappointed for the price I paid and I will not ever buy another pair of these
And, I am not an expert when it comes to sound quality so although in the title I said they sounded crisp, that doesn't really mean very much
They sound like any other earbud I have used to listen with
If you are looking for a simple pair of earphones that produce exciting sound from your iPod while on the go, then these are the ones for you
I have tried several pairs of earphones since looking to upgrade from the Sony Mdr-Ex55/Blk Ex Earbuds
I've tried the Ultimate Ears Metrofi 220 and even the Sennheiser CX 380II (the sportier version of the CX 300) but these earphones clearly stand out as a winner for several important reasons
First, the sound emitted from these tiny buds is simply outstanding and refreshing as it delivers clear highs, balanced mids, and crisp lows
I immediately noticed a steep improvement over my less superior Sony's through its voice clarity and a resounding oomph in the bass response
The bass is very important to me in headphones because in my very eclectic taste in music, I love listening to plenty of Rock, Techno, Rap, and even Classical/Orchestral music--all genres that I believe should be enriched with a quality bass response
The Sennheiser CX 300II met my expectations as the bass had a nice "thump" to it that wasn't over exaggerated
I thought my Sony's produced good bass, but Sennheiser has since set a new standard for me
The ergonomic and comfort aspect of this style earphones is also a true winner
I seem to be one of the few advocates of the asymmetrical design in cord length because it not only helps reduce wire clutter in front of your chest, it also reduces unwanted noise caused by rubbing against the wire because the cord is already laying on you
In contrast, Y-shaped cords have a tendency of bouncing against your chest as you walk and are always in the way of things like your zipper
I'm a daily train commuter who truly utilizes the advantage of the asymmetry of the CX-300II's design as I take my coat on or off or even while I read a book
The comfort doesn't end there because the simple ear bud design provides a two-fold advantage for the listener on-the-go: 1) a great seal which is key for noise isolation which gives you the sound quality and especially bass recognition, and 2) a strong hold in your ear that doesn't even give way with slight tugs on the wire
This last characteristic might sound trivial at first, but let me tell you there's nothing more frustrating than having to fix your ear buds with every turn of the head like other ear buds have a tendency to do
(I returned the Sennheiser CX-380's for this reason since the design of those buds never wanted to stay in my ears)
I easily wear these CX-300IIs for up to 5 hours a day with never any discomfort
This model has a total cord length of almost 4' and a gold-plated right angled plug which are two great aspects in its design to consider as well
I haven't found any noteworthy complaints about this product yet and with such a bargain price offered on Amazon here, I highly recommend this product
P
S
I listen to all of my music with the EQ off on my iPOD touch 3G which, by the way, has a stark improvement in sound reproduction by its amplifier over older iPOD models I have owned
Something to consider when you, the smart shopper, is reading this review and others like it because you should wonder if the reviewer is using the earphones on the same type of device you use and if your current device produces the highest quality sound
very nice headphones
I had these ones before, and got them again
Will buy them again
I happen to run across the Sennheiser in a parking lot I was lucky
Ive had this same pair for over a year and bout to by another pair, Ive dropped them in my drink and washed them in the laundry with no lost in sound quality, Ive tried several others which where a waste of money
These are diffidently a 5 stars for me
This product is good, but from the packaging and overall finish I initially felt its not the genuine Sennheiser (I also have Sennheiser MX 85 Sport series earphone which is a genuine one coz I got it from Sennheiser store)Anyway since the sound quality is good when connected to my Sansa Fuze I am happy and I rate it 4 stars
I was very happy with the original CX300's
They were my entry into in-ear buds and the quality difference was signicant (coming up from regular Apple earbuds)
The new model is awful (as is the CX200 [II
] and CX500)
The sound quality and comfort is still wonderful, but the iPhone-compatible connector is awful
It breaks after a few weeks or months of heavy use
It's partly the fault of iPhone (because of the deep hole you can't grasp it from very low), but mostly Sennheiser for not taking it into account when they market is as iPhone-compatible
If your player doesn't have the Apple-specific narrow connector, then go with the original CX300's and you'll be happy
If you have to look at narrow connectors - look at competitors
That's what I'm going to do after being a trusty Sennheiser fan for several years
The name says 'Precise Bass' but all I can hear is the treble
The treble is amazingly clear, but I bought these specifically to hear more bass and these just don't deliver
I have been a fan of Sennheiser for over 30 years and will continue to buy their products, but this one just fell short of my expectations
Used the headphones for about 2 months now
Nothing too strenuous and I always kept the cord inside my shirt and my mp3 player in a pocket
In the last week, the cord has developed a short somewhere near the jack insert
I believe no matter who the manufacturer is, a set of headphones purchased should last for more than 2 months unless they are cut or damaged somehow
Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this purchase
When you move your head you get a deep thump from the moving cords, almost like a stethoscope
Never foun the pob with others
Bought it from your Deal , the first set i recieved one headphone was not working and same was the case with second one as well
I had previously been using some 5-6 year old Sony MDX (forget the exact model) earbuds that I had picked up for ~$60 back in the day
I loved them to death in every way and finally they gave up the ghost
I figured, technology + time meant I could probably grab some $30 headphones and they would be pretty equivalent
How wrong I was
Regarding these Sennheiser CX 300 II head phones:- Sound is ok
Could have more bass
Just doesn't sounds as good as my old ones
Disappointed
Also they have an actual mini-speaker with a wire mesh over it (imagine stock iphone earbuds, and miniaturize the speaker to it can sort of fit in your ear canal
This was _very_ different from my MDX which from visual inspection you could see no speaker, only a tiny hole
- Fit
Not too bad
Can wear them all day and be comfortable, but still don't feel as good as my old ones
However, they are hard to grasp to put into your ear, and I feel like I'm going to break it trying to get it fitted properly
- Has one cable longer than the other
I'm fine with this and actually prefer it
Major cons for me:- The wire mesh over the speaker, when I'm adjusting the earbuds or trying to put them in, it's obviously under some pressure and makes a sharp twinging noise (almost like it's cracking or being bent)
Insanely annoying and its quite loud so that it actually hurts
Only happens on the right side, and doesn't happen on the left bud
- Insanely bad line noise
Like absolutely ridiculous
If you move around at all, your going to hear it
Very distracting and ruins the experience
- Occasionally when I do move around - it actually shocks me
Yes
I get electrocuted in my right ear
It's not anything super severe or extremely painful, but its very disturbing, and freaks me out
I can't relax because of it
Completely ruins my listening experience
Honestly maybe I just got a rotten pair
I'm considering returning them (if that is at all possible)
Even if the wire mesh didn't make the tinging noise when adjusting them, and even if I didn't get shocked when moving around - I would still not recommend these
The sound is not as good as I was expecting, the quality of the product feels cheap, and trying to adjust and put them into my ear - while "easy" - feels like I am going to break them at some point
This may be due to when I put them in, I then twist them so they sit properly
The "twisting" puts a lot of pressure on the line / cable coming out (there isn't anything else to get leverage on) and it just feels flimsy - like it will break
Cannot recommend unless you are easy going and don't care too much
I'm picky and these definitely are IMO quite terrible
I should have paid more $$ for something with more quality
I bought these to replace a pair of skullcandy ink'd earbuds that I had lost at the library
I saw these pop up on my recommendation page
I said, "what the heck
" They were well priced and they were Sennheisers
When I got the package, the box was scratched and there was no included instruction booklet as suggested
The "leather" pouch was obviously pleather
The sound quality was iffy and I could distinctly hear a thumping sound
I was kind of irritated that I bought a fake
Well I have learned my lesson
While Amazon does have some real finds, this purchase was a real let down
Buy from an authorized dealer shoppers
It is worth it
Great value
I like the case on the Shures better and the cord could be thicker, but overall these are a great value with excellent sound
Bottom-Line: You can't go wrong with the Sennheiser CX300 Ear-Bud Headphones
Strangely enough--I should the word be unfortunate
--the iPad does not ship with ear-buds
The 3
5mm ear plug is there, but the ear-buds are missing
So, soon after purchase my iPad I started casting about for a decent set of head phones
Standard sized headphones just would not do; too pigs and bulking and certainly not portable enough
Ear-buds were the most viable alternative
I of course wanted Bose, but the entry point into anything Bose is steep, too steep as it turns out; who wants to pay close to $100
00 for a set of ear-buds
During my search I ran across the Sennheiser CX-300 Ear-Bud Headphones for a reasonable price ($24
95 at Amazon
com)
They received reasonably good reviews on the site--and here at Epinions--so I decided to purchase them
The CX-300 Ear-Bud Headphones are designed for use with Hi-Fi audio, portable MP3 players, or laptop computer
The black Sennheiser CX300 are non-ported in-ear German-mad ear-bud type headphones
They ship a handy case and (3) sets of removable silicone ear pads: small, medium--installed on the ear-buds--and large to of course fit different ear canal sizes
The Sennheiser CX300 have a frequency response of 18Hz-21,000Hz (human hearing is 20Hz - 20,000Hz), with some 16 Ohms of impedance
The ear-buds use a stand 3
5mm plug with a 2
79 ft
Y-type black cord
Note: the right hand (Y connection) cord is longer that the left as is standard practice
PerformanceI have used other ear-buds in the past and none have delivered the sound quality and comfort the Sennheiser CX300 deliver
I was pleasantly surprised by the bass, mid-range, and treble (high end) sound reproduction from these small headphones
I listen to a lot of contemporary jazz and classical music and so far the Sennheiser CX300 Ear-Bud Headphones have been able to faithfully render the various instruments with starling clarity
In other words, these babies deliver the sound quality, range, and clarity one would normally associate with much pricier and over-the-ear headphones
The base response is deep, thick and enjoyable, while vocal reproduction is high, crisp and enjoyable without being too tinny
The only downside to the ear-buds that I can see is getting them in the small case they shipped with the cords, like all ear-buds, as unwieldy and difficult to fold and or wrap, but this is minor concern
The good thing is, once in the small case the CX300 Ear-Bud Headphones are ready for travel
ConclusionI like my new Sennheiser CX300 Ear-Bud Headphones, so much so that I thinking about purchasing a set for my laptop--the ear-buds that shipped with are horrible
I was looking for a decent pair of reasonably priced ear-buds, what I got was above-par reasonably-priced pair of ear-buds I am very pleased with
You can't go wrong with the Sennheiser CX300 Ear-Bud Headphones
This is a good example of high quality/price ratio
If you want descent ear-buds without investing to much in it this is your choice
I believe that everything else cheaper in this format is going to be just a wast of money
I enjoyed this ear-buds a lot
They are really small and light
Sound quality is a little bit below Koss PortaPro but portability of CX 300 II is much higher
I definitely would recommend this product
I bought these for my wife after her Shure ear buds broke
She loves the sound and the price and she is very picky
That's all that matters right
Enough said
Would recommend to anyone
These ear buds sound great, but like all of them, difficult to keep in my ear at times
my v moda buds which i think were great just started shorting out so i gave these buds a try they are better than the v modas imo the separation is suberb and they are much more clearer sounding while giving up a tiny amount of bass if any at all i'm sure these will only get better after break in the key to these in ear buds are the fit no matter how well they sound and for some reason they fit better than the v modas never working their way loose on me try em i think you will like them
These must be the best headphones for the price range
They work excellent for running as well and won't pop out of your ears
This was my first pair of quality headphones
I love my CX300 IIs for sentimental reasons now, as my Alessandro MS1s blow these away - a big step up in SQ - but these Sennheisers are not as bad as everyone says they are
They are mid bass driven
Period
Worth the $129 they cost in Canada
NO
But for $30 - $40 on Amazon they are excellent value providing very good Sennheiser bass heavy sound
As other reviewers mention, they sound pretty nice
But the build quality, and especially the quality of the rubbery cord, leaves something to be desired
First, the rubbery texture lends itself to tangled cords
Worse, the cord tends to wear out, leaving the little wires exposed, at which point you can tape them, but soon enough, these headphones will be done for
I'm not buying these again
These are the best fitting ear buds I have ever had, not that that means too much since it has been stock one for me and an old pair of sennheisers, but still these things are really comfortable and fit great
They also have great sound and Bass comparable to my over the ears, with better sounds isolation
Overall a great deal
I bought the Sennheiser CX-300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds
For me, I found the build to be excellent
The main plug & cord is of that thick, black, rubbery silicone material
Putting them in the little spring bag provided, they NEVER get tangled up
My old Sonys were forever tangling every time I used them
The cords to the ear pieces seem very sturdy
With three choices of rubber tips, I used the medium size and the fit was great & very comfortable
The sound is great & when I pumped up the bass, that was excellent as well
I bought these for twenty-five dollars after a five-dollar online rebate
At BB, they were sixty
What a deal
These are, without a doubt, the nicest & best quality earbuds I've ever owned and at an unbeatable price
If one of your biggest concerns is in the comfort category, specifically as you sleep while listening to music, these earbuds feel good enough with a regular pillow; but they work even better if your head is cradled within the "scoop" between the neck support and upper half of a pillow you can probably also get at an ergonomics store (not just a chiropractor's office)
My pillow is years old and has retained its shape
Why does this feel/work better
It's simply that as your head moves during sleep, you can easily, unconsciously smush your ear to the pillow in a direct enough way as to close down the route the music takes to your eardrum
Try pushing one earbud into your ear with your finger -- you can get the same effect
But that more open area of my pillow won't do that near as easily, thus all night long I can be relatively more assured I'm getting a complete balance of sound
Even if the nondisturbance of others isn't an issue, this method beats having a boombox on, because again, while on your side, one ear is naturally losing some of that balanced sound
With this very good earbud -- one not jamming your ear with pain -- you've got both sides covered
I had imagined the smaller tips would do me best but I was wrong
I have normal-sized ears and still they left too much of a gap
I was getting that high trebly sound but hardly any bass
Yet the larger ones still accommodate my comfort while on my side, as explained above
The neck pillow completes the experience
Good luck
Noise cancellation is amazing
Though it is not electronic noise cancellation like Bose headphones, they cancel noise really well
You can't hear anything
Fits comfortably in ears too
The head phones fit very comfortably, and the noise isolation is actually really good
I don't like the cord jack, it's at a right angle instead of straight
I was expecting much better bass though
There's more bass than skull candies, but the bass in these headphones isn't as deep as I had expected and at certain levels it sounds kind of scratchy
I had a pair of brookestone headphones that had much better bass
Like I said at certain tones the bass tends to sound distorted
No problems with noise when the cord is touched though
I purchased these from an authorised seller in Australia just over 4 months ago
About a month ago the rubber jack became loose and then the metal shaft broke completely away from the rubber boot
This has never EVER happen to me with any other set of head phones cheap or expensive
I only use them once a week on average, so they have not been abused
The rubber boot which covers the cable is made too weak
I am current trying to get them fixed/ replaced under warranty
I had no issues with the sound quality which was excellent
Regards Nik
Was looking to replace my Shure SCL3's that went half volume on the right channel for no apparent reason
Had it just over 2 years so it was out of warranty
I didn't want to spend a lot of dough and have it go bad again
Particularly since these are my backup earbuds
My primary buds is the amazing Shure SE530
Yes it sounds amazing, yes it is expensive, yes it is big and bulky and yes they are built like $500 earbuds should
I ended up getting an inexpensive set of CX300 II from ebay
at least I thought it was
the packaging looked real enough but I knew instantly it was fake when I played some music through it
It sounded like I was listening through a helmet
Muddy, unclear and no highs
I went to an authorized sennheiser dealer and paid $80 Canadian for the real mccoy
After carefully examining the visual differences between the two, I plugged it into my iPod touch
I was stunned
These little babies are delivering 95% of sound that I hear from my SE530, at less than 1/5 the cost and with less bulk and weight and better comfort
The bass comes close to the SE530's but the treble doesn't sound quite as sweet and clear
Maybe it will improve when I burn these in a bit
It certainly blows the SCL3's away
its going in the garbage after I finish writing this
At $80 I think the CX300 II it is worth every penny, and you can get a way better deal here
We get hosed in Canada so we get use to the higher pricing
Excluding price I'd give it a 4 maybe 4
5 but considering the price its 5 stars all the way
Other users complain about cord noise
Yup, there is cord noise except think about this, the cord is attached to the plug that goes IN your ear
Any type of in-ear bud is going to give you cord noise, that's the nature of the design
The sound is ok, nothing great
I find that it is a bit muffled
They are however very comfortable and do block out almost all other sound
My biggest complaint is that the cord is way too short
I cannot put my phone in my pants pocket and have the ear buds in at the same time
If I turn my head, one side pops out
Personally, I wouldn't buy this product again
These earphones sound great without giving me static electricity shocks like the Klipsch S4 did
I have to admit the S4 does sound a little better (these sound slightly muffled in comparison), but unlike the S4 I can wear these for hours without any issues
They fit snugly in my ears, do not fall out during sweat induced exercising, and do a good job of reducing external noise
I'd give them 4 stars on their own for sound quality, but 5 when compared to other earphones in this price range and below
They are a safe choice
I expected to be blown away by the sound quality of these headphones after all of the reviews I read on the net
They really don't sound any better than the Skullcandys they replaced
Moreover, the asymmetrical cord is a complete pain - one side is too long and the other too short
Probably seemed like a good idea to Sennheiser when they were designing them but it sucks in practice - the cord is always positioned awkwardly and snags on everything
Wish I could return them
These were a 2010 Christmas gift that I just opened
Typical sealed plastic container I had to destroy in order to access the contents
Hopefully I'll still be able to return with package in 5 pieces
Anyway, after auditioning these next to my standard iPod Touch earbuds I'm wondering if I ended up with the fakes people are talking about
The packaging didn't give any indication of a problem, but the sound quality is awful
When purchasing the iPod Touch I read many reviews that said how poor the earbuds were and how they should be replaced as soon as possible
Well these standard iPod earbuds are 100 times better than these
The Sennheisers have a very tinny sound and NO bass to speak of
I thought maybe I was crazy until I asked my teenage daughter to give them a try
She said she prefers her standard iPod earbuds also and that the Sennheisers have no bass
Maybe mine are either defective or fakes, and I'm going to try and determine that
But as it stands now I wouldn't take these if they came free in a cereal box
Only good point - they make the standard iPod Touch (3rd generation) earbuds sound like a million bucks in comparison
The product is overall good and I find the price to be a good one, but after a few weeks (2-3), the earbuds begun to crackle a bit and keep doing it at times, which is quite uncomfortable in the ear
I think the brand is very good, I would just pick another model next time
Nuttin much to say
they play fine and good for the money
I wonder how these sound compared to some $200 headphones
But i like em
Genuine sennheiser earbuds arrived, not fakes like many have received from other retailers
I love them; they're comfortable, have great sound and o
k
isolation
I've owned quite a few pairs of headphones, and I am definitely an audiophile after working at a big box electronics store in college
These are the best earbuds that can be bought in this price range (~$35 at the moment), and even for double the price I don't think you can beat the quality
The rich mid-bass tones are downright surprising for a pair of earbuds, and they provide a great alternative to my Klipsch computer speakers when I can't freely blast my music
My girlfriend has a pair of $300 Bose QC noise canceling over-the-ear headphones, and I would much rather use these given a choice between the two
These Sennheiser CX300B MK II earbuds are the winner in my 3-way comparison detailed below, and they cost far less than one of the well-reviewed and popular competitors
To start I will give a little context to my amateur audiophile review
I ordered the three sets of buds below after a fair amount of research of online reviews on multiple sites
Each set received 80-100 hours of burn-in with a combination of pink noise and dynamic music selection prior to being auditioned
Considering the price point of these 3 phones (all sub-$70), I reviewed them using a device to match what buds of this price would normally be used with
In this case, I used my Samsung Galaxy S2 with PowerAMP Music Player App playing Lossless Flac Files of the following selection:  Miles Davis-Kind of Blue, Jurassic 5-Power in Numbers, Pearl Jam-Ten (remastered), Norah Jones-Come Away With Me, Johnny Cash-American IV, and the Minnesota Orchestra-Rachmaninoff Symphonic Dances on Reference Recordings
It is also important to note that all musical gear reviews are subjective to a large degree and earbuds in particular due to fitting differently in each person's unique ear structure
Sennheiser CX 300B MK II:  Musical and natural and the most pleasurable to listen to across the majority of genres
Bass extention was deep and firm
Vocal articulation and midrange was clear, neutral and accurate without being analytical
The high frequencies were where the Sennheiser's closed the deal
Crystal-clear but silky smooth with no etchy, fatigue-inducing treble that plagues so many budget audio-gear
The only weaknesses that I can say is that the pair I got had unequal wire lengths (the right line was twice as long as the left) which I can only assume to be a rare abberation as I have not read that elsewhere
Also the buds did not fit my ears quite as comfortably as others I have tried
At about $21 shipped, these are an AMAZING deal
5 starsJVC Xtreme Xplosives In Ear:  Very good fit in my ear, and provided the best wind-noise isolation of the 3
As you may expect, the Xplosives shine in the Bass dept
The buds go slightly lower than the Sennheiser's (subjectively) and have a more forward bass presentation
There were tracks, however, that led me to the opinion that this bass was a bit unnatural and inflated
My goal in listening is to hear what the artist intended, and if something is added or missing, that is a flaw in the reproduction
The vocals and overall midrange were very good and enjoyable to listen to with no fatigue
The highs were presented a bit back and did not render the level of detail that the Sennheiser's were capable of and also had moments of sounding etched
However, these are a solid choice for earphones and are a great deal at around $20 shipped
4 starsKlipsch Image S4:  These are a very well reviewed and popular ear bud
At $55-$80 shipped, they are also much costlier than the other 2 sets in this review
I found bass to be better than any earbuds that come stock with devices (ipods, phones, etc
)
However, their bass pales in comparison to both the Sennheiser's and JVC's
The relatively lackluster lower end bleeds into the lower midrange and vocals, which create a much less involving and satisfying musical experience
The vocals and midrange overall was reasonable
The treble was fairly smooth and detailed, and had no major flaws that would detract from the listening session
Overall, an improvement from what you get with your typical device, but there are much better options for less than half the price
3 stars
Great quality headphones, sound great, are comfortable, fit very well
A great buy at any price
Would buy again and again
These turned out to be a big disappointment
If you touch or brush against any part of these you hear the feedback and it is bad much worse then any pair I have used before
You were warned
I got this ear-buds last week after long hours of searching for a good one with a good price
I finally ended up getting it after reading numerous product reviews about this product
This ear-buds was built with high quality, and the sound is top-notched
I would definitely recommend this product to everyone interested in getting this product
I bought this one from Amazon for $23
50, now the price has increased to $49
90
Great buy for the great product
Pros: Crystal clear highs and mids
Excellent for classical strings
Cons: Very little bass
Standard Sansa earphones had more bass
I had the CX300I and they lasted a while and I loved them, so when those stopped working, I figured I would spend $60 on the CX300II model at Best Buy
They worked for about a year and then the left side stopped
I saw they had a 2 year warranty, but you need to have a receipt
Because I definitely have all my receipts from a year ago
Don't spend the money on these
Get a cheaper model that will probably work even better
There are GREAT earphones for the money
I was pleasantly suprised when I ordered these to wear while cycling or motorcycle riding and needed something discreet that'd fit under my helmet
I found these for $25 - you should be able to too
And at that price, they are an AWESOME deal
I have the Monster Turbine earbuds ($179), I received them as a gift and I honestly don't really care for them much - especially at that price point
But I also have the Ultimate Ears Super
fi 5 EB, and though the Sennheiser's don't necessarily compare at that level, they area bargain at $25
The Sennheiser's themselves are a comfortable fit, very small (I can wear my motorcross and street helmets over them) and they stay in my ears at the gym or any other activity
The longer cord for the one side is so you can drape the cord down your back, it's kinda annoying to me since I always tuck into my shirt anways, but some people my like
I don't get much body feedback and what everone is asking, the bass is very, very good
Way better than the Monster's and "almost" as good as the Ultimate Ears ($170)
I wanted to write this article to recommend a good deal to my fellow Amazonians
If you're considering these, I'd buy 'em
These were great headphones
I used them primarily at the gym, but, after 2-3 months of use, the wire connection to the audio output broke
Now only one of the earbud works
Over the years I have had many different types of headphones, Grado 125's, Sennheiser's and numerous other MP3/Ipod type earphones
I am currently using some Sennheiser rugged sports earphones, in the gym
These developed a fault so looked around for a replacement
The CX 300's kept coming up on hot deals websites, and had great comments made about them
I paid $24 from Amazon UK
They were delivered very quickly
All I can say, is that for the price and size, the sound blows you away
The bass is good and the treble is superb
It also comes with a long wire, unlike a pair of Sony earphones that came with my MP3 player
Take my word for it, buy these at the a good price and you will not be disappointed
Fantastic for the price
They fit perfectly, right out of the package
I'm listening to my old favorites from the 70s and I'm hearing details I've never heard
Digital performances sound warm and clear, as with old time high wattage tube amplifiers with Bose or Advent studio speakers
No kidding
The best phones I've ever had
Period
I found what I was looking for:- Portability- Noise reduction- Comfort- Plenty of bass- Nice mids and highs- Asymmetrical cableI have the PX-100, PX-200II and the HD-228 that I use(d) with my iPod
I was kind of affraid of using in ear as I thought it would be uncomfortable, but I decided to give it a try
I couldn't be happier
If you like bass, this one will deliver, but remember that the tip (seal) is very important, otherwise you won't feel any bass coming through these tiny earphones
Most of the people don't like the asymmetrical cable, but I love it, just because I can hang them in my neck when not in use
I'm not sure but I feel that it drains battery faster than those I've listed above, there must be something related to ohms as this one is 16
I keep imagining how would be the IE models
Fortunately Sennheiser gives you the 3 sizes to fit ear canals that range in size equal to large viaducts to pinholes (I exaggerate
) But the key to in-ear earphones like these are to use correct fitting ear bud gels
So I changed the default medium buds the earphones already had on with the small ones to fit my, what-I-thought "dainty", ears
And I thought, these are awful
Well, I switched them with the large ones
Uncomfortable, wouldn't stay in my ears and another disgusted look
So, I put the medium ones back on
TADAH
It's the circle of earbud fitting - and hey
The little pamphlet it came with says that to get the maximum performance, the buds should be the appropriately fitting ones
And with that, you have really excellent sounding buds, nice bass frequencies and you know what
The reviews that speak of bad sound
You have to attribute that to what they might be listening to, how that stuff was mixed, etc
These are fine
The cord's a little thin, but I don't need 25 gauge wire hanging from my ears either
Check 'em out, put 'em in and dance
Picked these up at an FYE a few weeks back
Was looking for either Noise-Isolating, or Noise-Cancelling earphones as I travel (trains,planes,automobiles) enough that being able to listen to music, watch movies, etc
with high quality sound was important
I also have the traditional 'ear buds', bose 'over the ear', and a pair of noise-isolating sure in-ear headphones
I have to say that these Seinnheiser in-ear are my favorite, coupled with 'foam' replacement tips (is a must if you use them often), are outstanding
Especially since I got them for 1/2 the price of the sure in-ear buds I have
They come with silicone tips, and replacements, which are fine, but for short $$ definitely pick up some foam replacements
Comfort, quality, this combination is solid
Also come with a handy little pouch that is very sensible to put them in, take them out, little hassle
Only downside, wish the cable was a bit more lofty, similar to my Sure earbuds
Highly recommended
Bass is good, treble is mediocre but I got used to it
I love the noise-cancelling effect, it works very well and fits very well in my ears
Used it occasionally for a couple months now and have no problems with it so far
They also look cool :)
This was my first pair of ear buds and I don't think they are for me
The sound is good and I think they are best used for travelling (they block out sound ok if you can get a good fit in the ear)as opposed to using for running or in the gym
They are a reasonable price on amazon
For the gym I would prefer sennheiser 'over the ear' sport headphones
I have a pair of koss over the ear ones that also work well too but I think the soft covers will eventually get destroyed due to sweat
Overall the design of these is good but the sound is bad
There is a clarity to the bass that is better than cheaper earbuds but overall the lows overpower mid and high, so much so that you have to setup special EQ settings that normally would sound weird
Very disappointing buy
I ordered these from Amazon over thanksgiving weekend for approximately 25 dollars
They fit very comfortably and look and feel solid
The sound is good, but not what I would expect from a Sennheiser
My previous low-end headphones an older pair of JVC Marshmallows outperformed it in a few respects
In the low bass frequencies sound a bit dull and hollow
In the mid frequencies the CX 300's shine and deliver a very smooth sound
The highs sound crisp for the most part
Overall the CX 300 delivers good performance although its low frequencies sound soft and unnatural
What kind of user I am:I listen to my iPod at work/school/travel
Therefore, my earphone is daily beaten both indoor and outdoor
Basically, I listen to every kind of music from high def
vocal songs to strong base driven songs and from classic songs to pop songs
I would even use my earphone to listen to lossless music at home sometimes
When I pick an earphone, it has to offer me a strong beat of base while providing me a high level of clarity
I am not an audiophile who would spend $$ and do all the professional things even for a portable music player
Nothing is better than listen to the original instruments and voices at live
However, I am pretty picky on the quality of audio products since my dad and my uncles are audiophiles
Little history of what I have owned:I have own the Bose in-ear 2 headphone for almost 6 years
Currently it is my 2nd pair already and it never disappoint me, I really love it
However, the wire that connecting the 3
5mm head has wore out and it is starting to break apart
So, I need to search for a replacement and I want to try something new
Other earphones that impress me the most are Shure E3c and Westone UM2
The reason why I didn't pick them is mainly because of the price tag
(I am a student
)Why I picked this:I have read the review from Amazon and some other audiophile's forums
People claim that this earphone is an 20 bugs earphone which offering 100 to 200 bugs earphone's quality
There is not much negative feedback from users as well
Therefore, I think it is worth for me to give a try
First impression on sound:When I received it from Amazon, I plugged it into my iPod right away
First off, it has a very high treble which is very annoying to me but I guess maybe this is normal
All in all, my Boss has processed all the EQ setting with a chip on the earphone for me already and I may fooled by that
I have to set my EQ to reduce the treble
After the setting is done, I tested it out with different types of songs
Performance of this earphone:On base:It is very impressive and I can say it is not worst than my Bose
The earphone is offering a pretty strong, punchy base which satisfy me when I listen to pop and rap like Dr
Dre and Black Eyed Peas
On vocal:I tested with the song Habanera and Time To Say Good Bye, it is not crystal clear but I believe an adjustment on high pass in EQ would solve the problem
Yet, I can say it is excellent considering for the price tag
On acoustic:I tested it with a lossless version of Hotel California live version, it is impressive and very clear
I can clearly hear and distinct different layers of the song
On general:It is very precise and it does emphasis the base while it won't kill the clarity of other elements of your song
Also, the noise isolating works out pretty good
I don't even realize my roommate had walked into my room when I was testing the earphone
In conclusion:It is really an excellent earphone
A 20 bugs earphone which offering the quality and performance very close to a 100-200 bugs earphone
One thing that I don't really like is that I have to deal with EQ setting in order to push the earphone close to my personal preference
I was thinking to give a 4 stars but really when I see the price again, it deserves a 5 star IMO
If you want an economic upgrade on your earphone and you do a bt care of the sound quality it offers, this is the best choice
If you consider yourself an audiophile, perhaps I don't think you would even glance on this product
I don't now how durable is this earphone but again it just 20 bugs from Amazon
I don't mind to get another pair if it broken after couple years
Disclaimer:I'm sorry that you may have a hard time to read my review since English is not my first language
The review is based on my personal preference on listening music and my two cents knowledge
I am not a profession on wave science
I don't mind you teach me or correct me if I made a mistake but if you do want to criticize my review, screw it
Hope my review would become helpful
My old CX300's were going strong (after 3 years) until my son chewed on the headphone cables
I weighed these $35 headphones against far more expensive dual driver ear buds
I'm very happy with this purchase
The old model was great but these MKII's are a notch or two better
The sound is fuller and the bass is warmer without being overly pronounced
If I want $200 hifi cans, I would do better with AKG's or Beyerdynamic's
I am new to the whole Iphone experience and knew i needed to upgrade the unbelievably HORRIBLE headphones Apple puts out with their phone
(how can the phone be sooo cool, and the headphones so ridiculous
)
anyway, i read the reviews and decided to try the Senns
in the meantime while waiting I picked up some Altec Lansing 15 dollar buds at best buy to get me through a long road trip
Big improvement in comfort and sound for me, and I am still very happy for the price paid
now come the Senns
they show up and the build is very nice, seem to be made for the long haul
I was expecting them to be similar to the altecs but they are definitely a step up
the mids and highs are more evident and the sound is more "spatial" if that makes sense, its a very rich sound
I paid 10 bucks more for these than the Altecs and am very happy with both
but the Senns are the winner here and well worth the small difference
If you on the fence, get these, you wont be disappointed
Bought this item at late October, and the price drops 40% within no more than 1 month
Bad luck
Amazon should pay back in such kind of case
I have owned a few pairs of the CX300's so when I needed a new set and saw there was a newer model I picked these up
The sound from these ear buds continue to be of amazing quality
I also have a pair of Beats Tour (also in-ear style)that were given to me by a friend and I can honestly say that while the Beats sounds a hair clearer the Sennheiser's are my clear favorite and tremendously cheaper
Pros:Fit well in my ear (and provide multiple sizes for everyone)While not actually noise cancelling these buds do an amazing noise blocking job, with the right ear nubs anything past mid range volume on my mp3 player and I do not hear a thing other than the musicHits the lows at the beginning and end of the song, surprising me with lyrics I had never heard before on some songsNot ridiculously pricedCons:These tend to break on me, the CX300II's are my third pair in 1 1/2 years
But I do use them a lot in the gym so I am rougher with them, but they do come with a 2 year warranty
Neutral:As an FYI the cord is asymmetrical, meaning at the split one side is longer than the other so it will snake behind your head, which I personally love, others may notConclusion:Continued Excellence for a great product and good company
The buds quit working after about 10 months
My son, whom I had purchased them for Christmas, contacted Sennheiser for a warranty return only to be advised that A 1 is NOT an authorized Sennheiser reseller, thus Sennheiser will not honor the warranty
I checked on the Sennheiser site and voila, sure enough A 1 is NOT an authorized reseller
I have done business with Amazon for years and this is the first instance where I have found that their primary source for a product is NOT an authorized reseller
Buyer beware
I bought this for only 20 bucks, from the other reviews i became convinced about getting this
Amazing audio quality, the bass is just great, it's a little uncomfortable using them for the first time but i got used to it, these earphones cancel the noise very well, i'm just surprised
These are also my first in-ear earphones and i feel very satisfied
I totally recommend this if you don't want to spend more than 30 dollars and have an amazing product
It also comes with a carrying case which is very useful for protecting the earphones and another 2 ear adapter sets for a total of 3, a small one, a medium one, and a large one
The earphone is pretty good for its price
But the case is totally a joke
It is just two piece of leather which can do nothing to protect the earphone from pressure or twist
If you are going to buy this one, consider it as without carry case
I will start with saying that I love headphone/earbuds, and I am on a life-long quest to find great sound
Actualy, sometimes I feel it is more like an addiction (like buying a new set of cans at 2:30 in the morning because I cant sleep)
It is not realistic to say that these little buds are the Be all End all of pristine and perfect sound quality that people spend beacoup bucks trying to find
Not everyone is crazy like me and willing to spend $400-$800 on a set of buds or cans that will bring ever so slightly supperior sound quality
So unless you are me and have a need to stick anything that claims to be high quality in or on your ears, and you are just looking for a fantastic sound at an unbelieveable price - GET THESE
(But a strong word of caution - buy only from authorized retailers
I suggest chooseing ships and sold from Amazon as they are an authorized retailer and honor the 2 YEAR warranty
)A little backround on my references of comparison:  As far as earbuds are concerned, I own the Monster Turbines Pro (gold), Ultimate Ears Triple Fi 10s, Monster Jamz, Maximo iMetal w/ mic, Etymotic Research MC5, and of course the Klipsch Image S4
I'm not going to bother with much comparison of the Turbine Golds or the Ultimate Ears, suffice it to say they are slightly better sound, better Isolation, better asthetics, better accessories and hundreds of dollars more
Lets also toss out (litteraly) the Maximos, they are terrible but have a good mic
I gave them to my wife who could care less about sound quality but loves the cloth wrap on the cable
This leaves us with the Monster Jamz, the Etymotic MC5, and the darlings of cnet and therfore the internet - the mighty Klipsch S4
In this case we are really just nit picking here because all of thease buds are great for the price (or the street price)
I found that if isolation is what you are looking for the Monster Jams and thier solid metal construction provide the best, but the lows are flat and the buds themselves are heavy
I have also heard that they are prone to cord breakage and other issues, but they do have a 3 year warranty
I wouldnt know as I use them sparingly
The Etys are a great set of buds and offer great sound quality for the buck, but have a very odd look to them and also leave the low end of the spectrum a little flat and in the background
As for the Kipsch S4, this is a very good set as well, but I am a little amazed at how highly regarded the are
They are good, dont get me wrong, but are they the best earbud under $100
No, no they are not
They do try very hard to be dynamic and emphisize bass and trebble but this also comes at the cost of the midrange falling into the background a bit
This emphisizes the frills of a song, but leaves the meat of it a little left behind
They also take forever to burn in, for me it took over 70 hours to get the best sound
My biggest issue with the S4 is that because the dynamic driver pushes an emphasis on the highs they can sound tinney, metalic, or unnatural at times - Try Amy Winehouse's Back to Black at a reasonably loud level and you will hear what I am talking about
And I do not mean to pick on the S4, but if all your are going by is the Cnet or Amazon reviews then they will push you toward this set and you may be missing out on hidden gems for less money
The Sennheiser CX300 MX II are incredable for the price here
They have do have a dymanic frequncy responce curve that favors the higs and the lows, but less exagerated and the dip in the mids is not nearly as pronounced as the S4
The Senns still have supprisingly punchy bass and clear highs and all the while are virtually distortion free
It certainly is a matter of oppinion, but the majority of listeners will bennifit from the Senns flatter frequency curve while still enjoying a good-excelent bass responce
All this being said, the Senns are about half the price as their lowest competitor
I highly recomend starting with this set of buds due to their price tag, and if their sound leaves you wanting more you can always go up fromt there (Beware this can get addictive)
But, I believe that over 99% of casual music listeners will LOVE these
And even for someone like myself, thease have become my most frequently used buds because the sound is fantastic, and if something were to happen to them I know I can pick them up again without breaking the bank
Here is my rankings:1) Senheiser CX300 MX II ($25-40)2) Etymotic Research MC5 ($55-85)3) Klipsch Image S4  ($79)4) Monster Jams  ($40-120)*Note:  This is ranking sound quality and overall value, if you are looking for superior isolation look at the Monster Jams, or the Etymotic
Pros:  -INCREDIBLE BASS
It literally sounds like you in a room with a sub
-The highs are crisp and responsive as well
-The 90 degree plug is awesome  -Earbuds fit comfortably, but firmly in ear
Makes them great for running  -They're $26, i mean reallyCons:  -Mids sound a little muddy and washed out
Messing with the EQ with alleviate some of that  -The asymmetrical cable can get in the way if you're like me, and prefer to put your MP3 player in your right pocket  -The asymmetrical cable also makes it awkward to wind them up
Conclusion:  For $26, I dare you to find a better pair of earbuds
You definitely won't get as good sound as an over-ear design, but Sennheiser makes one of the best efforts that I've seen to bring top-quality sound to earbuds
The muddy mids are a little disappointing, but won't subtract from the enjoyment of your music
I really wish Sennheiser made these with a more traditional Y-cable design, but the cable is long enough that it isn't too big of a problem
But with all that said, you will not find a better pair of earbuds for less than $30
I've used Sennheiser earphones for many years now, mainly because of the great quality of their products
That's also why I turned to these CX 300 MK-II, when my Apple in-ear phones decided to call it a life after some 5 months of use
These are half the price of the Apple ones, and the sound quality is better by no small margin
They are very comfortable to wear, even after hours of use
They come with a selection of small, medium, and large interchangeable fittings, allowing one to find the ones best fitting your ear size
They also come with a small satchel in which you can carry them
This little bag, however, is nothing to shout about
I never use it, finding it nigh on useless
Highly recommendable
Very good sound for a small asking price
Just received my CX300mkII's
The sound on these is unbelievable
Sounds like you are in a room with a huge subwoofer
Very good low bass response, and equally good sounding highs
Highly recommend these earbuds
This is my first pair of in-ear headphones
I also own the Sennheiser PX100 and Sennheiser HD280 headphones
I have to say, for $70, the Sennheiser CX 300-II in-ears have rather great audio quality
Bass thumps and the highs are clear
The mids could be a bit better but boosting the proper frequencies with your audio player's equalizer can improve the sound
Using the small sized adapters, I get a good seal, and after a little while I don't even really notice them in my ears
I can't comment much on durability, since I've only owned them for two weeks now, but they seem sturdy enough so far
Overall, I can't imagine finding better quality canal headphones for this price
Definitely a good buy, whether you're on a budget or not
I bought a pair of Sennheiser CX 300 headphones approximately six months ago
The sound was wonderful, crystal clear, well-defined highs and lows
Three months later, the left headphone started cutting in and out, a few weeks after that, the right one followed
The store I bought them from replaced them under warranty, and the exact same thing happened to the new pair in about the same amount of time
For reference, the headphones these replaced a set of Shure SCL2s that lasted four years, through much rougher treatment, and much harsher conditions before the covering on one of the cables started to fray
I love these ear buds
The package comes with three pairs of ear tips in different sizes so it was easy to find a pair that fits my ears well
The noise-blocking feature is pretty great except when I couldn't hear my boss calling me at work a few times, because I was listening to music with these ear buds at work
Oops
The sound quality is amazing, and I just love the bass and the beats
Great value for the money
I would recommend it to anyone
Will probably buy another pair in white so they'll match my new iPhone 4 in white
These are excellent headphones
Sound very good and clear
They are a steal at this price
I think they are better made than most, but all headphones of this type must be carefully protected
I use an Altoids tin for mine
Have bought this (or similar) Sennheiser products for several years and love them
I use them principally for listening to audiobooks and occasionally music on my iPod and plugged into my computer for listening to musical performances on youtube
Sound is fine for these purposes
I like the fact that they are robust as I transport them from computer to my car to iPod for bedtime listening
They are versatile and I'll continue to buy them as I occasionally lose them
Sad to say, the senior Mr Sennheiser died recently
I also have two of his more serious over the ear headphones
Simply the best sound I have heard for the money
It is a great value
I trusted that Sennheiser's products were of high quality based on the high amount of praise and respect the brand receives, so I had very high expectations for the CX-300 II
Unfortunately, the pair that I received broke after only a month of use for seemingly no reason, and now only the left earbud works
If this hadn't happened, I probably would have given these a 4 or 5 star rating, as they fit comfortably in my ears and sounded very good for the price
While I am far from being any sort of audiophile, I will still say that these earbuds had clear sound (most noticeably the base) and the noise-cancelling was fairly good
I also liked the asymmetrical lengths of the wires
To say the least, I am highly disappointed to see how poor quality this product turned out to be
It is possible that I was unlucky and just received a defective pair, but I'm not going to take any more chances by pissing my money away on Sennheiser products again
These earphones are excellent--as long as you don't move your neck or head
Otherwise, you get a deep thump from the moving cords, almost like a stethoscope
I've also had iPod, Shure and Bose earphones, none of which had this problem
I found it highly annoying and sent them back after a couple of days
I went for the Sennheiser cx300ii ear buds because of the outstanding reviews that i have read about it
I also trust Sennheiser to be one of the better audio companies out there, so I started out with high expectations
I am not an expert on headphones, but i have listened to a few high end pairs so i know what i am talking about
The Sennheiser cx300ii did exactly what they claim to do
They had very good noise cancellation
I literally could not hear any outside noise when the volume was turned on
You don't even have to put the volume up too high for the noise cancellation to take place
Even when the noise was off
they still blocked out a lot of the outside noise
The sound quality of these headphones are good, but i would not say that they are the best for this price range
The headphones deliver good base, but i still heard a little distortion when the music was turned up really high
The headphones also have a very sleek sennheiser look, that i was impressed with, and they also seem quite durable
I have had no problems with them so far with durability
I do not like how you have one side of the cord longer than the other, so you can put it behind your head, but this is just a personal choice
Overall these are a great pair of ear buds for the price, but i have heard better sound quality in the 50-80 dollar range
I had a pair of these for about a year and because of my misuse(yanked on it while it was still attached to my laptop) the wiring broke near the connection
Of course it was still under warrantly and they just sent me a completely new pair for free
Maybe it's just my ears but I have yet to use a pair of headphones that are more comfortable than these
The way the right ear piece is longer than the left makes these headphones great for working out and the way the ear buds are designed they will not fall out unless yanked on
The sound on these are amazing of course, It is Sennheiser after all
During the time I had sent the Sennheisers for repair I decided I wanted to try another pair of headphones
Did some research and looked up some reviews and came across Klipsch IMAGE S4 In-Ear Enhanced Bass Noise-Isolating Headphones
I ordered a pair from amazon and the first day of use I already hated them
No matter what ear piece I used it just wouldn't fit right
They kept slipping out during physical activity
The sound was rather muffled compared to the Sennheisers and this is definitely just me but the feel of the wiring just wasn't satisfactory
Anyways my new CX300 II are back and that is what I'm using atm
I'm going to sell the s4 headphones to one of my buddies for half the price
OH don't forget the CX300 II are cheaper than the S4s as well
By like $20-30
I LOVE THESE HEADPHONES I HOPE YOU DO AS WELL
There are GREAT earphones for the money
I was pleasantly suprised when I ordered these to wear while cycling or motorcycle riding and needed something discreet that'd fit under my helmet
I found these for $25 - you should be able to too
And at that price, they are an AWESOME deal
I have the Monster Turbine earbuds ($179), I received them as a gift and I honestly don't really care for them much - especially at that price point
But I also have the Ultimate Ears Super
fi 5 EB, and though the Sennheiser's don't necessarily compare at that level, they area bargain at $25
The Sennheiser's themselves are a comfortable fit, very small (I can wear my motorcross and street helmets over them) and they stay in my ears at the gym or any other activity
The longer cord for the one side is so you can drape the cord down your back, it's kinda annoying to me since I always tuck into my shirt anways, but some people my like
I don't get much body feedback and what everone is asking, the bass is very, very good
Way better than the Monster's and "almost" as good as the Ultimate Ears ($170)
I wanted to write this article to recommend a good deal to my fellow Amazonians
If you're considering these, I'd buy 'em
These were great headphones
I used them primarily at the gym, but, after 2-3 months of use, the wire connection to the audio output broke
Now only one of the earbud works
I lost my Sennheiser CX-300's, so I got this updated model as a replacement
I was happy to hear that the sound production of these is just as good as the CX-300's were, but these have a higher quality fit and finish
They still have the assymetric cable (which wraps around the back of the neck instead of dangling in front of you), and I know this is just my own preference
But I like to drape the headphones around my neck when I'm not listening
It's a useful feature
Improvements of the CX-300II over the CX-300 are a longer cord, and a more durable L-shaped connector plug, and a much sturdier connection between the two cords that lead to the ear buds
One nice thing to note about the quality of these, is that the opening canal of the earbud is covered with a metal mesh grate, which is a better idea than what Sony does
they cover the earbud opening with a piece of felt paper with a hold punched in it
This paper deteriorates over time, but the metal on the CX-300II's does not
In my opinion, Sennheiser did the right thing by not messing with the sound of the CX-300s
They are almost legendary
All they improved was the finish and durability, and these were good improvements
As far as comfort goes, this is very important to me, as I listen to audiobooks and podcasts, and can have my earbuds in for hours at a time while I'm working
The Sennheisers are one of the few models that never hurt my ears after prolonged listening
I don't even feel them in there
I use the largest size silicone flange (it comes with three sizes), and they fit snug and stay in
Very comfortable
I might get another set of these in case they are discontinued at some point
These headphones far exceeded my expectations for sound quality
I couldn't believe that the mini-bud style even has the capability to produce bass this low and precise
However, the product quality is terrible
Before I bought these I read multiple reviews claiming that the jack was too easy to break and that the headphones get loose connections without effort
I discarded them thinking that the majority of people don't take proper care not to stress the wires and instead simply yank the jack out all the time
Well, I wish I would've listened
There appears to be no stress relief on the jack at all, so the slightest pressure breaks a solder joint
After being meticulous and careful about plugging them in/out and storing them properly, they lasted for a pathetic four weeks
I feel like they could've saved everyone the trouble by either not bothering to put their amazing company's logo on the product, just using a jack that heat-shrunk to the cable or simply filling the jack with some kind of hardening polymer (like a glue gun)
Putting the stress on the jack/outlet instead of the tiny gauge wires is very simple engineering
I know there's a 1 year warranty on these, and I plan on dealing with the cost of shipping to get a brand new jack end on them, but I also plan on making them a worthwhile product when I have them returned to me by voiding the warranty and adding my own stress relief
I am a classical musician with very discerning ears
I have also recorded CDs, and have worked closely with producers, editors and mastering engineers during the recording process, listening through a variety of different headphones
Because of this, I had previously invested in pricey, Shure E4Cs years ago, which worked well until one earbud began to fail
I expected the quality of the sound of the Sennheisers to be far inferior to the shures, but this is certainly not the case
Furthermore, there is definitely more than just a few dollars to be saved
The noise isolating on the Sennheiser CX 300 are not as good as the Shures, which do have a tighter fit (they sit a little further up the ear canals), but if you like a looser (and thus less noise-isolated) set of in ear phones, these may well be the right ones for you
Because of the slightly inferior noise isolation, I often hear extraneous noise on trains/planes/cars, and thus need to turn the volume higher than I would with the Shures
Therefore, this means more sound going into the ears
I personally don't prefer this, although the slightly elevated volume hasn't caused any ringing of discomfort
All in all, due to the price and quality, I highly recommend this product, for travel, leisure, or even an extra pair of headphones to keep in your backpack or car
The seller Closeouts Master sold me fake sennheiser cx300 II earphones
I was cautious about ordering these earphones because of the large number of fakes circulating, but I believed that a "fulfilled by Amazon" purchase can be trusted
I was wrong
The moment I received the package I knew that it was a cheap counterfeit
I have owned a genuine pair of cx300s for over an year and I know their packaging, build and sound quality too well
The packaging I received from closeouts master was awful/shabby to say the least with numerous little paper bits/dust and multiple huge scratches on the "inside" of the plastic casing
I wanted to return the product right away
but I first wanted to try the earphones anyway
after all I had waited for these for 2 weeks since placing my order
The quality of these fake earphones was pathetic across all dimensions
the flimsy earbuds, the fake sound driver casing, the uneven mesh/grill, the artificially enhanced bass output, you name it
I just returned this product
I guess I will have to buy from an Authorized Sennheiser Dealer next even if it means that I will have to pay the full retail price and not the Amazon discounted price
well worth it imo considering that it'll be a genuine sennheiser product that I will be buying
I originally bought the CX300-B last year when Amazon
com was still selling them, and they stopped working recently
I found the warranty information online and sent in my earbuds for repair and they sent back a brand new CX300-II Precision pair
It has great sound and is even better than what I bought originally
Make sure to only buy from authorized dealers such as Amazon, b/c there are a lot of fakes out there
Definitely worth the price, and the 2-yr warranty just makes the deal even better
Great sound quality
Other sound completely blocked out
Fit comfortably
However the design is weird in that the left and right earbuds split from an awkward spot near the left earbud and have a long and pointless wire over to the right
This is weird looking and can't be adjusted
I don't understand the design
I'm no audiophile, but I did need to replace my last set of earbuds after I rather brilliantly sent them through the washing machine in my gym shorts pocket
I bought the Sennheiser CX 300s based solely on reviews here at Amazon
I'm please to report that my fellow reviewers were spot on
I feel like I'm hearing more of the music than  I did with my old buds and definitely was surprised at how much base these tiny things put out
Recommended
Do not buy this product for less than ca
55 $ at a certified retailer
I can approve of everything that has been said about this cheap copy: the sound does not compare to the original and the build quality is inferior
The original Sennheiser CX-300 II deserves 5 stars and is definitely worth the money
i've had these for two days now and love em
but first off let me just say, do some research and find out about the impostors, chances are if u are paying less than 59
95 you're gettin the fake ones, sounds crazy but i think its true
anyways i went to best buy to get em cause their an authorized dealer, and when i was their i saw the klipsch s4's so i got em both and am in the process of comparing them to pick one, and i am having a hard time picking one and saying one sounds better than the other
i have had the j bud j3's for a while and love those by the way, their just as good in my opinion maybe just not as balanced (a little harsher at high volumes)
but just want u all to be aware of the knock offs
the real ones have a rubber cord by the way not vinyl or palstic
i heard someone say pony up the money and get the real ones from an authorized dealerupdate
-you want a review, you can't handle a review
i'll try to make this short and sweet
i went to best buy to buy the sennheiser cx300II's and when i got their i saw the klipsch s4's and skullcandy titan's, which i read lots of great reviews on all of em
anyways i went to get the cx300's from best buy cause they sell the real ones, their an authorized dealer, before you get anything from sennheiser call them and ask if the place you're thinking about buying them from is an authorized dealer
their's lots of fakes unfortunately
when i was at best buy i saw the s4 and titan's and wanted to hear them all so i bought them all
well to get this out of the way the titans sound good (crazy bass, ridiculous) but the s4's and cx 300II's are simply better, one thing the titans get kudos on is the cord, its like a thin strong shoe lace feel
anyways i burned em both in for a couple weeks before really comparing, i really couldnt tell any difference, i wanted to like the cx300II's better cause their 20 bucks cheaper and more comfortable (way more) and flush with your ears, they dont stick out at all and i really like the around the neck cord, it frickin works, ok, its genius actually, they'll never fall out no matter what you do, it stays outta the way better and doesnt get pulled on, way less cord noise too, like none
the cord is a lot nicer too, a little thicker and rubber not vinyl
but those s4's just look so nice man, the design is pretty sweet
i think after that reason, the reviews (cnet too,whatever, that chick should do the comparison i did) the fact that their more $$, my mind was fooling me into thinking they are better
so i got sick of trying to compare by pausing the music unplugging one plugging in the others and then puttin em in my ears, it just takes too long and by the time i hear the next set i cant tell a difference
so i broke out the splitter (male into 2 females) plugged in both sets turned the volume up a little cause you lose a little power with both plugged in
then the trick is to switch phones as fast as possible with the music still playing, like hold the set you're gonna switch with your thumb and pointer and pull out the others with pinky and ring fingers then pop the others in real fast but still making sure you get a good seal(sounds crazy but wow its the only way to really hear a difference) i was switchin in like 2-3 seconds
when you have a instant change then you can hear differences
anyways to wrap this up the difference was quite remarkable
the bass on both seems to be pretty equal, but the mids and highs on the cx 300II's are clearly clearer louder and crisper and richer, whatever you wanna call it, its just clearly, better
do this comparison for yourself if your trying to pick and having a tough time (just make sure you buy the real sennheisers, i dont know what the fake ones sound like and i dont care)
so the winner of this battle is obviously the cx300II's
ps both of these are better than the jlab j3's too, i have em and still like em, but both these are all around better
sorry one more thing i'd like to say
i now have the sennheiser IE7's, which, if crap was holy, holy crap these are amazing
leaps and bounds over s4's and cx300's, which  of course they should seeing as how they are so much more money
butfor me i was ok with spending the extra money cause i listen to music all day at work and wear em everytime i ride my motorcycle, which is all the time
by the way the cx300's are way better (than the s4's)for riding less wind noise and the ie7's are the best, best noise isolation and least wind sound, im talkin bout wearin a half helmet of course (which helmet straps have a big part to play on wind sound too)
cx300 is best for full face as the helmet goes on easiest, then ie7 then s4, although its not too difficult to get a full face over the 7's or s4's just requires a little more work
i did try the ie6's too but the 7's sound better and are way better for riding
bikers will appreciate this
by the way if you have ears on the bigger side which most males do, the s4's might tick you off a little with their small tips and stupid oval design, c'mon, oval design
the ie7's retail for like 389 but i found them for 170 new from an authorized dealer
they are built like a frickin army tank, very comfortable, lots of tips, double flanged baby, sweet box (no big deal), an amazing case, amazing
and the sound is just phenomonal, blows cx and s4 outta the way, all around, and i do believe they require a lot of burn in time( like 100+ hours) before they reach their full potential, i didnt believe this but now that i've reached this point they sound beter than ever
if your like me and listen to music a lot every day you might be interested in this
oh yeah they look sick too
one more thing, you can get the ie6's for like 20 bucks more than the s4's on here, which are way better
big review i know, had a lot of stuff, hope you could handle it
This is my second Sennheiser headphone purchase and again not disappointed
The Sennheiser CX 300 II Precise Bass headphones sound amazing, excellent job on the bass
These sound like they cost twice as much
I expected them to be smaller, they are still big
sound is just OK
good
BEST EARPHONES EVER
I had a litter higher expectation of these
They pretty much sound like $20
00 headphones
These have a good sound for the price
They produce a great amount of volume and are pretty comfortable in the year
It is definitely a good buy for the price
Great earbuds
I fall asleep watching movies on my tablet,  and these are very sturdy
Really amazing headphones considering the price
I just wish that they weren't so long; they often get stuck on things and yanked out of my ears while I'm walking
A detachable cable would be a nice addition too, but considering that these suckers are only about $30
00, this is the best bang for your buck
They sound great
Enjoying ear buds every day
I bought these for the sound quality, which is fantastic for the $$
That aspect I wouldn't trade, but some of the other "features" totally irk my caboose
The length of the speaker spindle is so short that I have to take the cord over the top of my ear to be able to insert it into my ear properly
This isn't a ultra-significant issue
The compounding factor however is the disparity in the length of the earpiece cords beyond the junction where the cord splits into two
One is very short and the other is much longer
I am not really tacking on the reason for this
They say it is to help alleviate cord tangle but the truth is (for me) this feature is totally obnoxious
Because I have to wrap the cord over my ear, I have to bring the earphone cords around the back of my head
I have had to customize the cords by winding the long ear-cord to the main wire with a tie
I'm getting used to it but it is not cool to have to spend all of this effort to "fix" something that Sennheiser's engineers shouldn't have done in the first place
If these cord sections were of equivalent lengths I would personally be more pleased
Again, for the cost, the sound quality rocks though
Very disappointed with my experience here
Received my ear buds with a defect
Right cord is more than twice as long as the left
Sent these back to receieve another with the same exact issue
Value for money, better audio quality than azure $70 version
Sennheiser equipment seems to usually beat out the completion
wonderful earbuds, the sound quality is amazing, and the price is good
nuff said
I've gone through a lot of sub-$50 earphones over the years: ultimate ears, sony, skullcandy, and sennheisers have been my favorite in terms of build and sound quality
I've also tried several models in the CX line - 200, 300, and 400, and the 300's have been the best bang for the buck in my opinion
My wife did have a pair fall apart on her after a couple years, but she traveled with them and kept them in her purse without a case
My office pair are going on about 4 years, and work great
If you're going to put earphones through the ringer than I'd suggest looking elsewhere or be diligent about storing them securely, but if they're staying on a desk, then I'd highly recommend these
These headphones have superb sound quality
You can feel the powerful base, but it doesn't overpower the treble
Listening to songs using these, it's almost like hearing a different song because there is so much more depth and character to the sound
With these headphones, I can actually recognize the difference between high and low quality music
The build on these is what you need, a long cable, and the wire from the splitter to the left earphone is shorter than the one to the right
Especially for the price, these are a great buy
It worth 20 bucks, love it
Much better than my old Iphone earbuds
The quality is very good for the price
The clarity on the ear buds are great for the price
I was really enjoying them until I compared them to the ear buds I got with my phone
They low frequencys and base is just practically non existant
Also, one ear bud cord is longer than the other and is uncomforting
I have been using a brand of headphones that few have heard of called SoundMagic
The E10 to be exact
The reviews were good, and lived up to the expectations
But I needed another pair of headphones because I would forget them at home sometimes, wanted some for work
Sennheiser has a reputation so I decided to try these
What a let down
No contest at all
The SoudMagic E10 are superior in every way
The Sennheiser are so staid and lifeless, with less isolation of individual sounds, and generally 'smaller' sounding
I kept switching between the two while testing and couldn't wait to get back to the SoundMagics as soon as possible
These Sennheisers are adequate as a backup, but that's about it
Seriously disappointed
I just love them
great sound for the price
The quality is great
Perfect
Beautiful sound and good fit
Hands down the best in ears for the money, I'm taking one star off because the wire is thin and easy to tangle and break
I broke a pair once just by putting it in the case wrong
As long as you're careful though, it's great
For those looking for boomy bass these are not for you, but those looking for pure clean headphones with high clarity mids and highs for a low price these are headphones you simply must try
Sony's Are Great
But These Tiny Little Cutie's Are Awesome More Base
How
At Two Third's Less Too
Possibly 1000 Times Smaller Then Those 50mm Head Phones
And So Carry Easy
Sound Perfection
Best Yet
Thanks Amazon
An Awesome Surprise
Not Expected
Best sounding ear buds I have ever heard
Has really nice bass and is extremely clear
Impressive headphones that after 8 months of hard use during workouts, work, and everyday listening: have given me awesome sound, good fit with the multiple size things, haven't fallen out of my ears, block out pretty much all outside ambient noise, great bass, great highs no distortion, have the gold plated jack, and have survived numerous washes (as long as I let them dry for for a few hours before trying them)
However, there are two things I don't care for, which is the jack being at a 90 degree angle, meaning it plugs in then the wire comes out perpendicular
I don't notice it much but it can be annoying when I put my phone in me pocket and it snags and pulls the jack out, no biggie
Another thing is the odd length of the left and right bud wires
The left is shorter (I guess to prevent them from tangling
 whatever)
Still damn good headphones (earbuds if you gaf)
Buy them you won't be disappointed
Awesome sounding ear buds for the price
I am no expert
Never had the ears to be an audiophile
So take my words accordingly
The CX 300 II deliver beautiful, clear sound
I've used them for months, watching television, movies, playing games, listening to 320bitrate music
They are the best earbuds I've owned
That may not be saying much, as I've always bought fairly cheep
And while these are certainly less than expensive, they do stand out from the pack
Particularly in performance
Their sound is a wonderful, layered tapestry
Hmm
can a tapestry be layered
I submit to you it can
Especially an audio tapestry
The one true and prime disappointment I have with this pair lies with the claim of "Enhanced Bass"
Perhaps the bass is enhanced from earlier CX 300 models
Though it is nothing to ejaculate over
I desire more
Are they worth buying
For the price found on Amazon, you bet your bleeding ear canals
Personally, I'm still looking for a pair of earbuds that blow me away
This journey shall lead me into an impoverished existence, as all the promising examples cost so much more
So I reiterate: for the price, the Sennheiser CX 300 II earbuds, are incredible
great
Earbuds work great and were a great price
I use them for travel because they are so compact
Very comfortable to wear with the cushy rubber
Excellent sound quality
The sound quality is quite good, but I cannot recommend this product
Making the cord lengths unequal between ear buds was truly a horrendous design decision (there sadly is no mechanism to adjust this)
There's too much slack in the right ear bud that the cord will slap against your chest while running and ruin your listening experience
Got this for around $30 back in last december
Used it mainly in only buses and waiting rooms
Right side busted in 8 months
Sound quality is just above average
Not recommended
What a waste of money
As others have posted very, very noisy as they move in ear
Cannot even walk without loud sort of scratching noise
They have been tossed in a drawer
Did Sennheiser engineers even test them in the real world
I think not
I like the sound quality
However after a few months the rubber tube that attaches to the earbuds detached and now slides freely up and down the wire
It still works well though
A bit too much bass for me
I returned it an bought the Sennheiser standard earphone
I bought these because they were cheap and I have a lot of respect for the Sennheiser name
I have a pair of HD600 over-the-ear headphones which are amazing
I needed some in-ear headphones for listening to music in very noisy environments
I had a pair of $100 Sony ear buds, but my dog chewed them up
These Sennheisers are not as good
They fit well, and block out external sound well, but I am a little bit disappointed with the sound quality
They sound a little bit "crunchy" with annoying resonances up and down the spectrum
They are worth the discounted price, but I guess I was looking for a really good deal
I have had several earbuds, and several from sennheiser alone
They have always sounded great and I have managed to get the for amazing prices
I'm not really a fan of the one side being longer than the other to go around the back of your kneck, but you can't compete with the sound and build quality of the sennheisers
They never break either, I just tend to lose buds easily
Fits well, several ear piece choices so you can find a good seal
Over all very good sound
Lows aren't spectacular, but better than most small ear buds at this price
The cords to each ear are asymmetric, so that the right ear can flip behind your head
This keeps the cord out of your way
I love it for doing yard work
This might be annoying if you keep your phone in your right pocket though
The sound quality is fantastic for the price, but the "asymmetrical cord" is downright obnoxious
When I opened the package I thought I received a defective product
It is neither functional (a small breeze and it's game over), nor appealing (they look ridiculous)
I'd return them, but it's not even worth the $32
50 I paid for them in the first place
Explore other options before settling on these earbuds
These earbuds fell apart just after Amazon's 30 day return window
The audio jack separated from the rubber attachment to the wire
Either the unit I got was faulty or Sennheiser earbuds are completely shoddy
I want to take advantage of my 2 year warranty but I can't find information on how to do it
They are great
Wonderful bass
Comfortable
I do not like asymmetrical cables,but no matter, I love them
I love these headphones, the sound quality is excellent and they fit really well, when I wear these I can barely hear anything else around me, so they seal very well
The only thing I am a little disappointed with is that the left ear bud is purposefully shorter (I didn't notice this on the description), but it makes storing them a little more difficult
great performance but the noise of wind is quite obvious,so not suitable during windy day
The quality of these ear buds are pretty good
The bass is very nice of course, HOWEVER
The left wire is shorter than the right, so the wire for your right ear is supposed to go behind your neck
I did not realize this until it was too late
I do not like this style of headphones and wish they made it more clear in the title or at least the description of the product
Amazon is also not letting me return these for some reason
Possibly because they are shipped from Australia
Another thing to be aware of: The warranty is only valid for residents of Australia
(Seems a bit like false advertisement to me) In conclusion, I'm not satisfied with the description of the product, the style, or the return policy
This was definitely not one of my better purchases from Amazon
com
I bought these a few months ago and I regret doing so
I have another pair of sennheiser earbuds which retail at around $50 and they have great sound quality
So I was expecting some similarity when I bought this particular pair but I was hugely disappointed I can't use them they're that bad in comparison
I do not recommend these not saying sennheiser is bad just this particular model
as for earbuds none are really all that great
where these differentiate is the different combinations of comfort attachments for getting the right fit per ear size
a little too brilliant on the high-end, but adjusting the eq solves that to an extent depending on the production quality of the source
regardless, they are far better than what apple provides with their ipods/iphones
Best buds I ever owned
Quality product
Good quality, it would be better  if more mid-tone sound
Fit good but sound cheap
Should be worth around $15-20
Astounding sounds produced from these in-ears
I am a musician at my church and we use P-16 personal mixers and these in-ears work amazingly well
The responses of the bass guitar, drums, keys, vocals, electric guitar, and my own acoustic are crisp, bright, full, and clear
I also use them for personal use off the stage and the sound is still amazing
You can easily hear the bass runs and the kick drum clearly, the vocals are nice to the ears (not piercing), and the guitars are well balanced
I know that it is from the mixing of the recording producer, but these in-ears don't add in colors to the instruments and vocals
The noise isolation is astounding as well
If they sound is not coming from inside the device, then you ain't gonna hear it
Big reason why, the band I play with, now calls me Moses, lol
For $60, you can't beat that price for these
I love them and would definitely buy them again and again if it is still in production
I also, these in-ears, I have been using them on and off stage for 2yrs now and they still sound amazing
Great headphones
These were a birthday gift for my son and he was very pleased with them
These are one of the best earbuds I have ever owned
It is very portable, sleek and most importantly, there are very few that can contest in the sound department
(I mean that goes without saying considering it is Sennheiser right
) Anyways, it was packaged very properly and also has good audio jack that seems very durable
It is a very great item to own
This is the second pair I have purchased and I am very dissatisfied with the fact these failed within several months of purchase
I thought the other pair might have been lemons and so purchased a second
I would definitely not recommend these unless they were used by someone who was very inactive
I often wear pods with my iPod at bedtime and listen to audiobooks
These will not last
These are great earbuds
You can wear them all day (8+ hours) with _zero_ discomfort
Very good sound range
I bought several for my wife and myself, and intend to buy Sennheiser products
Awesome
Worth every penny
very comfortable
Only had them for a week or so, but they are by far the best sounding earbuds I've ever had
Love them
They have great sound and the hug to the inside of your ear
I can out them in while in bed and watch a movie and they stay put
I don't have to keep putting them back in
I have been using a brand of headphones that few have heard of called SoundMagic
The E10 to be exact
The reviews were good, and lived up to the expectations
But I needed another pair of headphones because I would forget them at home sometimes, wanted some for work
Sennheiser has a reputation so I decided to try these
What a let down
No contest at all
The SoudMagic E10 are superior in every way

I kept switching between the two while testing and couldn't wait to get back to the SoundMagics as soon as possible
These Sennheisers are adequate as a backup, but that's about it
Seriously disappointed
I just love them
Already i knew this brand before
They are very professional on their job
for this price i advice this headphone
Usually it much better than other very expensive brands
This price for this quality makes sennheiser ideal option
I gave 4 stars just for there are higher versions of this model
Sound quality is good, but I don't like offset/uneven earbuds
Sent back to Amazon and bought a pair of Sony's
Do not think twice
It is awesome
So worth the money, these sound just as good as a hundred dollar pair
Comfortable and great quality sound 9/10
Very good sound quality for the price, noise cancellation is super
I love this earbuds,  Excellent sound
I owned previously a CX215 until the thin left cable tore apart (my fault), and after them a very good pair of IE4 until I left them don't know where
Both of them had very good sound for their price, the IE4 obviously superior
It was a big loose
But this CX300 have an even better sound
Well balanced, not so aggressive bass, nice fit
Love them
They sound great but the sticky rubber that they wrap the cables in gets stuck to everything and ties itself in crazy knots
That is seriously annoying
sounds great, but came with left ear cord 5 inches shorter then right ear
too much trouble to send it back for another pair
they still work but vender must have purchased rejects at a deal
Pros: Amazing audio quality, extremely comfortable
Cons: Easy to break, only lasted me about 3 months
If you are going to be sitting in an office, or on a chair in your home, these are great
If you are going to be active while using these, I would advise against buying them
I love Sennheiser products, but the durability on these is quite low
Best headphones you can buy for $50-60
I really don't know if the one I got was just one of those rare 1% defect in stock but it sounds terrible
I'm not aiming for the stars and expect $500 worth of sound quality but this one is really just unexpectedly plain, especially after all the positive reviews I've read
Compared to the new apple Earpods, these are plain, lacks base, treble is "off", just not something I want to ever listen to anything through
These are the best in ear headphones I have ever purchased & they come with a 2 year warranty
I wear my headphones most of the day, so they get much wear and tear
It was very easy to get Sennheiser to send me a replacement set when I short occurred
Love these earbuds
Sound is amazing
Excellent seller
Just buy them, worth
Best headphones to buy at the price
I have a pair 18 months old and going strong
Deep bass sound
Have used for running, planes and trains ( not automobiles
)
Very comfortable for my ears
Has a range of bud sizes
I love my sound and this remains the best set of head phones I've ever used and I'm very fussy
These things work really well
until 1 little problem comes along, then its all down hill from there
I owned 2 pairs of these terrible things and after a few months of the first pair, the right side just went out, no reason for it, just died
However at the time I really did like them so I ordered another pair and after a month and a half the wires are all screwed up and now I have to press down on the black part that contains the plug in for my iPod because if the wire moves even a little bit, the sound gets horribly distorted
If you plan on listening to music with these headphones but never leaving the house, go for these then as the quality of music is awesome, but if you plan on doing any physical activity, find another pair
Best earbuds I've ever had
I've tryed so many other earbuds and they just don't match up to these
For the price I was pleasantly surprised
They are warm sounding with an enhanced bass
Good mids and highs
Actually more pleasing then my beats
Always thought the beats were a bit muddy
A good low cost listening experience
Cables rather fragile
Recommended
Great quality headphones, but the right earbud cable is WAY too long
I know the idea is to wrap this around your neck, but that’s incredibly uncomfortable
With a series of loops I evened it out, and the sound is crisp and wonderful in them
Got them while on sale for about $32
Fit well with good isolation from surroundings and came with a nice carrying pouch
Good bass but wish the sound was a little crisper
Only really noticeable when I first started using them and then quickly adjusted
Very satisfied with the product for the price I paid
It's Great
I'm not really professional in earphones but at least I promise this one is ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT from the free earphones with your iPhone
(I hate that earphones : \ )  I also have "Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Headphones"
That headphones sound better than this one
But after all these are tiny earbuds which are very convenient to carry on when you go outside
In general, I am sure these are the best earbuds under $50
Tips:1
The price is fluctuating
I bought it @ $30 sold by Amazon but I think it's super worth to buy it if the price < $35
2
It includes carrying pouch
I like it
So don't forget it
It is hidden in the packagings
Fortunately I glimpsed the picture of pouch on packagings before I almost threw it into bin
Two words
Buy them
Pros
Cheap (got them for ~$35)Way better than Beats
Bass <3Nice highs
Plug that you plug into audio place is sturdy and wires won't break
Cons
None
Honestly,I had mine for about 8 months with heavy use
(School and such) and they are well worth the money
For under 50 bucks these are a steal
What are you waiting for
Buy some
:)
Awesome sound
Love these
They have great sound for the price
Like
elementary SENNHEISER product
good performance INDOORS - the sound of wind is ridiculously  clear when there is wind
Terrible design
Do not buy them
The first thing you'll notice about these headphones is the wires leading to headphones aren't the same length
The splitter is fixed with the left ear wire considerably shorter than the right
It's supposed to be an ergonomic design, but it's just really frustrating having the splitter on one side of your body, you're constantly aware of it, and you instinctively want to pull on the wire as you walk b/c it's running down the side of your body, and not to mention you look like a moron with one length of wire hanging under your face
The splitter is also huge and pulls on the left ear every time you turn your head to the right
I already mentioned this but you can't change the lengths of the wires coming out of the splitter which makes the headphones not versatile at all
Can't take them running or use them while doing an activity b/c they just get pulled out out your ears
There is also minimal to no bass as much as they want to advertise these headphones as enhanced bass
You can hear a nice mid-range and vocals come through very well, but no bass
I'm also not sure why they felt the need to make the 1/8" jack connection huge as well
It's about half as wide as my iPhone
Terrible headphones, I wasted $30, look for something not stupid
I'm sure they're wonderful sounding
If you're deaf
Pros:1
They're headphones2
Did not cost too much3
The sound reproduction is excellent, even at lower volumes they retain the warm and body of the music
4
The little vinyl pouch is more useful than I thought it would be, I use it to keep the headphones intact in my pocket
Cons:1
way way too loud
on setting 1 volume, they deafened me to the point of pain in quiet situations
2
The stereo mini jack into the device I'm using from the headphones has this weird arch, I would prefer a low profile, as the higher type gets caught on things
3
Asymmetric headphone wire - this is an exercising improvement - but really - if you're using these for exercising, let me introduce you to any set of headphones that hook over the ears or Bluetooth
In summary, these headphones are great for everyday commute use, but not for a quiet office
The vacuum cleaner ate my old Sennheisers that fell on the floor
These are good quality as usual from Sennheiser but they are tinny sounding compared to the phones I got with my Iriver MP3 player
I miss my old ones
Great in-ear headphones for the price
The shipping was fast but the product did not work correctly it has to do with the cable jack it was messed up
I had to rotate it in a certain direction in order to get sound i tryed many devices to make sure it was the ear buds
the quality of sound that came out was ok not any better then the CX 215 witch is alot cheaper than these but than again the messed up cable jack could have hindered the quality of sound another thing i dident like about the CX 300 II the left wire was longer than the right i thought at first that it was a manufacturer mistake but comes to find out that's the way it's suppose be, i must have missed the fine print some were
Had another paid of the same model in the past, but these are much less comfortable
It's always my favorite earphones
Great sound quality with cheap price
One of the headphone died quickly within only one month of use
Great Sound
Have had mine for years now
They've outlasted more expensive pairs and still sound great
they sound good
Pros:- The sound quality is good
- The jack connector is well made
Cons:- One ear wire is longer than the other
- The earbuds do not fit very well
Overall:- Spend the extra $20 to get the Klipsch s4
Let me start this off with a warning - if you're looking for earphones for running or otherwise exercising, these do have a fair amount of cord noise
For straight up listening, or even just walking, though, these are an amazing-sounding pair of earbuds for a very good price
They do an excellent job of isolating outside noise, are surprisingly comfortable if you find the right size seal, and in terms of sound quality, it was like I was listening to my music collection for the first time again :PThe build quality also feels quite sturdy, I don't feel like I'd break them by dropping them once (and as a matter of fact, I didn't)
Sounds great
However, I was more amazed by how lite feel the speakers are when in the ear
It seals off really well too
Good earbuds for kids who are always loosing them
Great bass sound
value for money
not suitable for running as you can hear the cable sound
Had these for 2 months, and still working great
For the price, these headphones give a great, loud sound
Plus, especially with the bent adapter, they're rather sturdy
The bag is also a nice touch, and takes up very little space
For me the medium size fits great in my ear, and after a while I sometimes forget I'm even wearing them
Overall, one of the best you can get for the discounted price
These earphones are well made and fit comfortably in your ear
I'm giving this 5 stars
Good earphones, that sound nice
Think it may take me a while to get used to the asymmetrical cord however
The sound quality is superior to even more expensive headphones
Yes, earbuds that are way better than many headsets
Very fair price for the quality
Sennheiser never disappoints
Standing in an airport several years ago I saw these in an electronics shop as I realized I needed a replacement for the poor quality ear buds I had left at home
I worked in high-end electronics in the 80's and Sennheiser was a headphone powerhouse then for the discriminating, so I picked these up based on their old reputation
Short summary - it was not a mistake
I paid more than what they sell for now, so the current pricing makes them a killer deal
At a glance do not seem overly sturdy, but they hold up very well
Having now traveled around the world a few times with them, wrapped and re-wrapped them up to fit in their cute little pouch, and used them daily at work, I can vouch for their sturdiness
For sound quality, they do cancel outside sound well, being very effective on airplanes or loud offices
Once in your ear and seated they will give you very clear sound, letting you hear things you may not have noticed before
On one long flight I was given a pair of Bose noise-cancelling headphones (which costs hundreds more than these)
Having never used them before I gave them the A-B listening test (yes, I was bored - it was a very very long flight)
After about an hour I gave the Bose back to the crew to get them out of my way
They sounded nice, but these little Sennheisers had a better noise cancellation, as well as a much finer sound
Highs come through quite clearly, and voices are both clear and sound very natural
As one who listens to much acoustic, classical, jazz and electronic music, these to me seem to fit all I have thrown at them very well
As a warning, I have found out that the musical source does make a difference
Make sure your digital output is high quality for the best sound
Google iPod DACs some time and you will see what I am talking about (it can be a rather heated debate)
My old iPod touch has better sound quality than my newer iPhone, for example
On poor quality headphones you would never notice this, but with these I clearly can
While you can go much higher in price and achieve far better sound, if your pocketbook like most of us cannot do that, then this will be a highly acceptable solution
It makes a great birthday present to yourself, for example, so enjoy them
I'm not a fan of the "y" style of the product where one side is much longer than the otherwise
Sound quality can also be better as it lacks bass
Have bought Creative headphones for less with more bass
Sound Cancelation is good
So far these are the best buds I've owned - clear sound and comfortable
Really great sound from a very affordable headphone
Solid bass with none of the fake distortion that comes from other brands with built in equalizers
I listen to a lot of pod casts and voices are normalized and clear
Music is crisp and clear
I'm very happy with these headphones
The J set up is odd t (one headphone has a much longer cord that goes behind your neck) but quite useful once you  get used to it
These headphones are amazing
The sound quality is beyond superb
The bass is not boosted which is great, I have my equalizer for that
The sound quality is so clear it'll make you question the quality of your music
I highly recommend
Easily the worst headphones I ever bought
The cable was a different length to each ear and then the left earbud stopped working in two days
Garbage
The sound quality is amazing and it blocks out a lot of outside noise
Now if there was a sport-specific version of these that would be brilliant
These are good quality headphones for the price
However, the main reason I was disappointed was because the lengths of the earbud wires were uneven
My friend liked them, they came in perfect condition
I'm sure they're wonderful sounding
If you're deaf
Pros:1
They're headphones2
Did not cost too much3
The sound reproduction is excellent, even at lower volumes they retain the warm and body of the music

These are good quality as usual from Sennheiser but they are tinny sounding compared to the phones I got with my Iriver MP3 player
I miss my old ones
These are my favorite earbuds I've ever encountered
The bass sound is amazing for buds and I really want for no other pair of headphones
Bae
The headphones actually work well, but the cord for the right headphone was more than 2 times as long as the left one making it extremely uncomfortable to wear
A shame the company is wasting good engineering and design via low cost/quality manufacturing in China
Returning them now - if the new ones come as advertised I will update with a better rating
Fantastic sounding earbuds for the price
I use these every day at the gym
They stay in my ears despite how sweaty I get
I used to use the Panasonic RP-HTF600-S Stereo Over-ear Headphones, but quit using them in the gym due to the length of the cord
I originally purchased the Sennheiser CX200 Twist-to-Fit Earbuds, and really liked them, but then I misplaced them and needed a new pair
The cx300 II is an awesome ear bud
It cancel’s noise better than anything I have tried except for Bose noise cancelling headphones
I was shocked and impressed the first time I used these ear buds
They are resilient, and sturdy
I have stepped on them twice, and yanked them out my ear a few times when catching them on a barbell or something ( I try to keep the cord under my shirt when weightlifting, but forget to sometimes) and I keep them in my gym bag that gets tossed around in my truck
I’m very happy with these and will eventually try one of the top line Sennheiser headphones
Thank you
Also let me be utilized
Outstanding sound
Deep bass capable and sharp trebles
Great bang for buck
Wowing
I have Sennheiser HD 280 Pro cans and absolutely love them
So how could I go wrong in getting buds
it went wrong
Precision Enhanced Bass is what is in the description of these buds
The bass presence is none existent, absolutely zero bass
I tried different genres of music and it was all the same result, no bass presence
I am returning and ordering some Skull Candy buds that a friend of mine let me try out
Beautiful
Great full sound
Crystal mids, clean highs, and deep precise lows
Yes I listen to rap, hiphop etc and these sound great with that, but I also listen to a ton of podcasts such as securitynow
and freedomainradio
This set works equally well for the pure talking as I find it brings the baritone out in the mostly tenor men's voices
Cats chewed through one set, shoulda kept it in the bag, any way I immediately bought another set and am still happy even if it's like I paid $70 for one pair
The medium earbuds are perfect for me
Also I have some cheap RCA earbud tips that fit this like I glove that I use
This headphones is perfect for music with powerful bass, like Metal, R&B, etc
I Recommend it amply
These earphones are simply great
Nice sound quality and do not tangle easily
excellent quality sound
good sound
I would say they are one step above the stock apple headphones that come with the purchase of an I pod
They are more comfortable to wear than apple headphones
The Quality Of The Earphones Where Ok No Problems Nothing I Did have a problem because i remember reading that it had a mic and it did not have a mic and one was smaller then the other cored just like how they sound other then that they suck
OK headphones
Sound is somewhat "dry"
Definitely not worth $80 (although Amazon sells them for $30)
Philips SHE6000/28 for $25 beats this product hands down
I will be returning this purchase
I've had two pairs of these (I lost one in my car) and I love them
The sound quality is good and they block out background noise very well because they go in the ear
The multiple size ear bud cushions are great as well
The chord is a little long though so it gets tangled in things sometimes
Love these headphones
They are loud and fit well
Not a huge fan of the short/long cord but I'm getting used to it
I wear these on my motorcycle under my helmet without issue
The Sennheiser CX 300 delivers good base and other frequencies better than other earbuds that I have owned
My only complaint is that the wire to the left channel is shorter than the right channel  wire - an unusual design
My first pair broke when the longer wire got snagged on an object that I walked past pulling the wire from its socket
But the sound is great
Very good especially if you want to use in flights
Comfortable for long durations as well
I love these headphones
I use to own the Bose ear buds
After about three years one side shorted out so I decided to give these a try
The balance is great but you can still get some pretty good low bass
For the price they are a steal
I use them everyday and the fit is comfortable
If you are looking for Bose quality for the Skull Candy price I would recommend this product
I have not been disappointing yet
I order a pair about once a year
I use ear buds a lot and every pair (different brands and models) eventually die out on me
Because of this, I don't want to spend $100+ a pair, so this price is much more reasonable
These buds sound great for the price
Just the right amount of bass for my rock and metal without it feeling empty or overpowering
They have good range
Not THE best you can buy, but also for a fraction of those
I'd recommend these over any Beats or Skull candy product as well
Don't get me started on those
These headphones cancel so much outside noise its insane, they might as well be soft ear plugs
The response on the low end is nuts
They look and feel exceptionally well built
The sound is crystal clear; it is so clear infact that you can hear that your pandora stream is not perfect
Amazing product, would buy again if it broke and the 2 year warranty didnt cover it
Comfort is 10/10, I dont see how an in ear set could ever top this at this price point
Didn't measure up to my expectations
Didnt sound that great and wouldnt stay in my ears
Better after break-in but still not great
The sport headphones are much better value
loved it
These are Sennheisers
Sounds like it actually sounds
Reproduces what it gets, crisply and cleanly
No bass overload and/or mush like the Dr
Dre/Monsters I ordered at the same time
Tough trade between these and the $120 Klipschs (sp
) I also have
Unless you like Rap or ridiculously bass heavy stuff, get the Sennheisers
service was really good
Headphones are just soso
I for my sansa clip, skull candy ear buds are cheaper and sound better
The sound quality is good, but the wires are rubberized and tangle extremely easily
I have two pairs of $9 earphones that are easier to unwrap
I prefer the cheap earphones over these
These are my favorite IEMs or in ear headphones for the price for the music I listen to
I listen to anything EDM, house, trap, dance, etc
If listening to these genres I would say these are a great buy since they have a V shaped frequency and has a great low end and a nice sub bass
If you plan on listening to any other non-bass dependent genres I would get a different headphone with more crisp and accurate mids and highs
For the money these are great and are actually quite comfortable
The cord is also tangle resistant and rarely gets in knots
The Sennheiser CX 300 delivers good base and other frequencies better than other earbuds that I have owned
My only complaint is that the wire to the left channel is shorter than the right channel  wire - an unusual design
My first pair broke when the longer wire got snagged on an object that I walked past pulling the wire from its socket
But the sound is great
Very good especially if you want to use in flights
Comfortable for long durations as well
verly goodSennheiser CX 300 II
These can't be beat for the price
The sound is superb and the asymmetrical cable is awesome
At first I was disappointed to find out that cable wasn't symmetrical like the one found on the original CX300, but after learning that the cable is suppose to wrap BEHIND your neck allowing you to hang the buds around your neck when not in use, I found that asymmetrical cables are far superior
The shorter end of the cable goes the the left and the longer to the right
There's an L & R printed on the buds which stands for Left and Right ear
I wear my buds all the time at work and I never need to stash them away in a pocket because they're always hanging off my neck
They also stay in the ear better then the CX300s because there's less cabling pulling down on the buds
All thanks to the asymmetrical cable
I wear then at the gym and while biking and I've never had a problem with the buds popping out
Plus they sound awesome with a little tweaking of the EQ on my Rockboxed Sansa Clip Zip
Great sound,adequate bass,terrific price,only drawback is the stiffness of the wires themselves,not very pliable like Sony MDR,for instance
Good product quality
The best sound ever from a pair pd earbuds any at a great price too
The expanded bass along with super mid-range and high notes creates a great listening experience second to none
For the money, the sound produced by these ear buds is excellent
I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them on, What an improvement
I've bought more expensive headphones that weren't as good
For the money, you wont be disappointed
great audio quality
I don't like the uneven length of the L/R headphones though
Great ear plug stand ins as well
It blocks out surrounding noise very well
Good quality for good money
Great audio sound quality, but came with only the one set of rubber ear pieces
Product description advised there would be three sizes (small, medium, and large)
A little disappointing
Tac
In my search for a new high quality IEM less than $100 to use on a daily basis, I tried multiple different ones and returned them all due to lack of sound quality, not fitting properly in my ear, or they had build issues right off the bat
I passed on the Sennheisers a couple times due to their reviews and low price tag (I was assuming lower quality, my mistake)
After doing a little more reseach, which I always do before actually buying, I came to find out there are a lot of fakes floating around out with some serious quality issues, hence the multiple 1 and 2 star ratings
I decided to take the chance and buy these directly from Amazon and I could not be happier with the results
These IEMs are a STEAL for $30
In comparison to other more expensive IEMs that I tried, it isnt even close
The build is very nice, earbuds have a nice feel/weight to them and they deliver big sound
Highs, mids, and lows all blend perfectly with all different types of music that I tested them with (funk, rock, acustic, electronic
) with nothing over powering the other
Bass is crisp and sharp, it is present but far from muddy which would have been a deal breaker
In the end high sound quality and a good fit was what I was looking for and these definitely delivered
Are these the best IEMs ever made
No but I dont think you can find a better set for less that $120
These are a great set of high quality IEMs for a bargin price, plain and simple
Good value for the price
Great Product, it have a good sound
broken on arrival
Pretty good phones, nothing special but seem to work well with decent sound
If anyone wants really good headphones, get Grado Open ears, these are good for the office to block out external noise, good bass
These don't stay in my ears at all, with any of the covers that come with them
Perhaps it's the shape of my ears, but I also thought the sound had too much treble
Ok
These are decent ear buds and have good tone and volume
They claim to have some noise canceling ability which they do not
I find that they are not very comfortable and the wiring has to be placed at odd angles to keep them from falling out of my ears
I tend to like my cheap candy ear buds better
I never had Supreme Quality headphones until I bought these
These earbuds sound better than my over the ear headphones I typically use for gaming
And since they're noice cancelling due to sealing of the ear canal, they are perfect for my business trips and being constantly in an airplane
Outstanding range
The bass is eyebrow raising in it's fullness
I am extremely satisfied with the performance of these earbuds
These sound great and the price is perfect
It took a little getting used to have the wire on the back of my neck but once I adjusted to it I find I prefer it to the conventional "wire hanging in front"
The bass output sounds great and they really are noise cancelling
This brand was recommended to me by my boyfriend who, is rather tech savy
I was a die hard sony headphones fan until these
I hope they last long
Im totally notorious for headphones blowing out >:) lets see how these last
Great sound quality so far, cancel out noise too
I was about to buy a pair of those Beats headphones but I did a little research and came across these
Wow
Awesome sound
Bass is hitting, the highs are very clear, and the music quality is amazing
Nice product and smooth transaction
BEST EARPHONES FOR PIRCE
Great sound good price and I like the asymmetrical cable around the back of your neck
You can take one bud out and it doesn’t dangle down to your belt and pull the other bud out
With that you can listen to your wife while keeping the music going in the other ear
I have been using these for a couple of months
I won't be replacing these unless they are lost
They sound really good and are very comfortable in my ears
For me, the initial fit was snug but never turns uncomfortable
I haven't needed to try the other sized rubber pads
I've fallen asleep listening to music with them on and in the morning they still haven't fallen out
The sound is clear and I think all the highs, mids and lows are all fairly represented
The bass is present and you will hear it on music where it is present, but I don't think the bass is overly emphasized
For volume, they get plenty loud even with my smartphone player or my android tablet
I have to stop cranking the volume before they start to distort
They don't have a mic, but i can just talk to the smartphone when I need to
The earphones seem durable and have survived some mild abuse so far
The little carry bag is more usable than most others because the spring loaded opening and closing is very convenient
I like them so much I bought a second pair
One pair kept at home with the android tablet and one pair in the bag when I am out and about with my smartphone,
Product shipped really fast and was as described
These headphones are a killer value and I would highly recommend them to anyone who wants affordable high quality headphones
Arrived in a very timely fashion and the item is stellar
I would absolutely order this item again
These are great
A staple in my sons life
Very please with the quality
Love these phones
Still going strong after three years and lots of abuse
Super clear sound and great frequency response
I have to say that I'm very disappointed in the Sennheiser CX 300II
Perhaps I received one with quality issues
It is supposed to be "Enhanced Bass" but it seems there is very little bass at all
Stock Apple earphones are much better
I had a pair of Bose earbuds and they were great
excellent bass response and very good through the rest of the frequency range
The CX300II are crisp, but nearly all treble and high tones with no bass
I'm disappointed, especially after mostly glowing reviews
If there was way to return them for a refund, I would
Otherwise they will sit in the drawer unused
Great sound quality
Only thing I don't like about it was the "asymmetrical cords" of whatever
One side's cord is considerably shorter than the other
I guess you're supposed to put the longer right ear bud around the back of your neck to your ear, it's kinda awkward but the headphones never fall out this way and I don't find the cord getting in the way as much
Good
Horrible I want a refund :(
I would love to write a long review about these, i have been through alot of headphones, including the klipsh ones and these blow anything i have ever tried away
deep bass response and the clarity is fantastic
Good Price
Good Quality
I have owned several sets of Sennheiser headphones (over the ear) for listening to two channel stereo
The all provided a consistent sound that I find pleasing
When I needed a set of earbuds, the choice was easy
I find these items to be solid performer at a reasonable price
They fit my ear perfectly and provide a full spectrum sound that is at least as good as the source material
Well done Sennheiser
I love using these at work
It blocks out nearly everything around me
The sound quality is very good and you can hear the highs and lows very well
Love the sound quality out of these
my only complaint is the awkward cord that tends to tangle up a lot
I use these at the gym and sometimes they get in the way of things
These are the best headphones you can buy for 30 dollars hands down
I'm a long-time user of Sennheiser products and they never disappoint
Sennheiser is the best
Great sound
Didn't realize there's no speaker
But amazing for listening
These headphones work great
I ended up getting them because I was sick of replacing my Bose In Ear headphones every year when the cord broke
For the price, these do a great job
They aren't nearly as nice as the Bose model, but they are 1/3rd the price and have lasted me two years now with no notable damage
They are comfortable in the ear and provide adequate sound quality
It does not have any noise cancelling and the cord tends to get extremely tangled the second you try to fold it and put it in your pocket, but other than that, I like it and would buy again
There is a significant difference between the CX 200 and the CX 300
These sound fantastic
I've give this as a present a few times now
A hit
Packaging is terrible, otherwise good headphones for the money
Quality is very mediocre
First, I'll start with presentation
It is appalling; Plastic packaging, which is a massive pain to open without harming the packaging inside, I don't know about others and you may personally not care about packaging, but to me presentation is a huge thing
Something that Sennheiser has failed horribly on
Especially when you experience an amazing un-packaging, earbud quality experience right before it (looking at you beautiful Xiaomi Piston 2
0s)
After this, I inspected my earbuds as I do all of them (qa on my end
) They appear cheap, compared to other less expensive ones I have purchased in the past (the poor cord, mesh, and plastic sound driver casing)
Never been a fan of the whole angled input either
Sound quality
It's barely above what you would get out of Skullcandy Ink'd line, and the bass is certain enhanced, it drowns out any other instrument, so if you solely listen to bass heavy music, and don't care about anything else, these would be fine for you
Otherwise, I'd go for better pairs
Pretty great IE headphones for 30 bucks
Sounds better than the free samsung ones
I don't suggest using these while working out
They fall out a little too easily
Also, the wire lengths are different so you can put one around your neck
Im not very fond of this, but I should have read more before buying it
At first I thought something had gone horribly wrong in production
Don't expect real audiophile quality with the k701 soundstage or anything like that
30 is worth it though
If you want good headphones at this price and don't mind them over the ear, check out the koss porta-pro
Using these for one and a half years
They are good earbuds
One earbud blew out, not what I was expecting from Sennheiser, I've used their products for years, these were just cheaply made all around
I bought two of these, they are really comfortable, sounds great, really worth the price
Best earphones in this category
I killed another pair of headphones (yet again) and purchased these after I've grown tired of using my default ipod earbuds
these have taken a serious beating this month and I had zero confidence they would last this long
They are very durable and solid comfort in the ears, although if you sweat a lot or get caught in the rain, they will do a little weird suction thing sometimes
The sound is beautiful and clear
I am a Dubstep fan, so I like my bass to be strong, these earbuds did not fail me
I know the sound is good when everything else around me is zoned out
you are in your own little world with these headphones
If you like bass, - buy themIf you need durability- buy themIf you want good quality at a good price - buy themIf you are easily irritated by the fact that the left earbud's wire is shorter than the right -buy them anyways, you'll get used to it
(seriously, if that bothers you too much, don't buy them
)
I personally bought these because the ones I had before (Skullcandy S2IKDY-003) stopped working correctly; and judging on the general "hype" people had on a good majority of the reviews here I suppose I expected a better sound quality but honestly in my personal opinion they sound just about the same (maybe just barely a tad clearer, but not very considerable) to the Skullcandy ones
As far as physical quality goes, they don't seem very durable, the cords AND the actual headphones feel remarkably fragile (also I noticed that the left headphone has a way shorter cord than the right, maybe made that way to easily identify left from right, I've actually never seen this before, but I don't know if I like it lol)
With that being said, I think the headphones are okay, the price is pretty low considering the quality so I guess it is fair, and maybe these headphones are made for a general music genre that I happen not to listen
So I'd say if you are in a desperate need for headphones and only have 30 bucks go ahead, but if you think you can wait, try to save some more money and get some better ones
Had these before but I broke them after about 18 months of hard use, so when I saw them in the Memorial Day sale I couldn't resist
Great deep sound, nice fit and they stay in my ear even when I'm exercising hard
Combined with some Bose QC 15s for travelling, my headphone needs are well and truely covered
I bought these on whim looking for a little better sound without breaking the bank
If you are a person who sits a lot & enjoys crisp sounding audio, buy these headphones
******((BUT))*******  FOR JOGGERS AND ATHLETES
One ear wire is 2x longer than the other, I guess to help it run down the side of your body
It's not a very good layout for running, jumping
or really much moving of any kind
Only had for a month
They were relatively inexpensive and I am pleased with the base
They sound much better than stock headphones
Cords look thin, might be a problem
Earbuds very comfortable
Good purchase
Love it
Great quality for little cost
Amazing bass and clarity
I use this headphone primarily for workout
The earbuds doesn't slip off as easy as the apple version
Buy it
Seriously buy it
The only con is the wires gets easily tangled
But whatever
Headphone only cost like $30
Why do people wear earbuds
So they can listen to music
in public
On the train, walking around, at work, whatever
When the cables are asymmetrical, it makes you look absolutely ridiculous
You end up with this weird necklace/beard of a cable just dangling limply below your chin, held up by the tension of the other, shorter side
Someone else said they're designed to go behind the neck
Uh, what
That may be true, but that looks equally ridiculous
I just simply can't put these on, look in the mirror and not say "Wow, I look absurd
Facing the world like this would erase years of social climbing
"So, that was a waste of money
It's really too bad, my previous Sennheiser earbuds were the best I've ever had AND they had normal cables (until they one day inexplicably snapped)
I just can not in any world fathom who thought this was a good idea and why companies still do this
Shirt sleeves are always the same length, pant legs are always the same length, etc
Please, can a company make an earbud that (a) fits snugly in my ears and (b) has normal cable length
I pretty much don't even care about sound quality anymore
I just want to be able to listen to music
Nice sound, excellent quality
The rubber buds fit nicely in your ears but, if you are working out and sweating alot, they do tend to get loose
Affordable, great sound, lightweight
Only complaint is the 70/30 style headphone cord
Never have been a fan of it but oh well, doesnt affect performance just a personal thing
Awesome sound and overall quality for the price
Highly recommend
Sennheiser has impressed me yet again
Really good bass quality and extra rubber buds which is always nice
I bought these after I lost my old ones, which I had bought about eight years ago
I loved that pair; the sound was very good and they were small and portable
Easy to take on the plane, etc
After searching and searching my house, I finally broke down and bought a new pair of CX 300 II
Two things struck me:  the sound seemed better than before - I was picking up little background notes and sub-melodies I had never noticed before;  the second thing I noticed was the cord noise was noticeable and bothersome
Well, two weeks after getting my new pair, I found my old ones
Now I have the chance to confirm my suspicions, I I was right on both accounts
The sound is indeed MUCH clearer and richer
Upon comparison with my old ones, even a casual listener could easily notice the difference
I think Sennheiser has really upped their game here
However, I was right about the cord noise, too
While there is similar cord noise on my old pair, it is lower pitched, and probably lower in "volume" too
The newer cord noise is comparatively high-pitched and grating
As others have mentioned before, the plastic on the cord is rather "tacky" so it tends to catch more, and every time it does so, it sends a thud up to to the ears
During the last two weeks, I have learned to be more careful of how I place the cord, and I can generally get by without much cord noise
Never had to take that kind of care with the old pair
I think Sennheiser really needs to improve on this
It used to not be so intrusive
Another, very minor, gripe is the "stylistic" shape of the plug
It sticks out too far, and takes more space
Unnecessary
In sum, I LOVE the sound and fit on these Sennheisers, and I'm 90% satisfied
If they could somehow reduce of that pesky cord noise, I'd be all in with five stars
Do not buy if you plan to run in these
The sound gets foggy and also sounds jumpy while running
Otherwise they would be fine
First off, these are definitely solid headphones that are comfortable to wear, they have good response at all frequencies
The worst part about them is the asymmetrical cords
As advertised, they significantly reduce tangling (but by no means eliminate it)
However, this means that the shorter cable is always under more slack which I don't like
I don't think I'll ever get asymmetrical again
Moreover, instead of the CX300s, I recommend the Sennheiser CX215s over this because I think they provide better quality sound (they're also cheaper)
I received from CX215s for a birthday present and I immediately loved them, they were super bass-y when I wanted them to be and when I didn't, the mids and highs were still extremely crisp
I was amazed by how great quality was (coming from someone who mainly uses V-Moda Crossfades)
I only bought the CX300s because I lost my CX215s and I expected the CX300s to have even better sound quality (since they cost more)
I was wrong and when I ever need to buy need in-ear headphones (as a gift or a replacement for myself), I'll be buying the CX215s
These Sennheiser earphones are small with big sound
Wow these are 2x better than my bose earphones and they cost a third of what my bose earphones cost
great buy
I have owned at least 7-8 pairs of Skullcandy earbuds in the past
Their sound quality was great, but I got tired of having to buy a new pair every 4-5 months
I decided to finally start looking for something else and came across these
I read up on some of the reviews and people claimed that these specific pair of earbuds lasted them at least a year
I felt the reviews were pretty trustworthy so I decided to give them a try myself
One thing that really made me glad that I bought them is that they are German made (not made in China like everything else is)
Since German products are typically a lot more reliable than Chinese products, I was (at first) more than happy to have bought them
Before they stopped working after only using them for not even 5 months the only thing that I found to be very annoying is the fact the the left earbud wire is half the length of the right
It gets VERY annoying sometimes
Even though this product has a higher frequency rating than Skullcandys, the sound is actually not that much better at all
And considering that Skullcandys are half the price of these, sound just as good, and will last just as long, I see no reason for me to keep buying from Sennheiser
There is a reason a lot of modern day house appliances like refrigerators and washing machines only last for a certain amount of time
My grandparents own a refrigerator that they bought in the 70's and still use it to this day
I know its only considered a conspiracy theory, but do you honestly expect me to believe that with the advanced technology we have today we cant make a washing machine or a refrigerator that can last longer than 3 years but yet back in 1977 (a time when technology was less advanced) a refrigerator could last you decades
Planned Obsolescence is less than a decade old
Ever since the recession, several companies have been doing it left and right
Tech companies are no different
Earbuds are the worst when it comes to this theory
Skullcandy, Beats and Sennheiser are all doing it
The people who claim their pair of Sennheisers lasted them a year obviously do not use them as much as me (I use earbuds every single day)
These earbuds only lasted me 5 months and then the left earbud started to go out
The point that Im trying to make is this: it doesnt matter what company makes it or what the price is, almost all tech companies use planned obsolescence when making their products so that they break over a certain amount of time and you, the consumer, must now go out and buy another pair
Theres literally no point in buying these headphones AT ALL
Skullcandys sound just as good and are half the price
Skullcandys are very similar to Sennheisers
They both last 5 months and they both have great sound quality
The difference
You dont have to pay over $30 for a pair of Skullcandys
Where the buds split one side is longer than the other
This makes it somewhat awkward to use sometimes
Sound seems good
They are horrible
They broke before they lasted a year
Not what I expected
Will never buy them again
Cheaply made
I want my money back
I got two pairs of these headphones right around christmas time this year i really enjoyed the quality of the music from these headphones
They perform very well in a wide range of frequencies
I found that these headphones deteriorate in about two to three months since both pairs have had the same problem where the left earbud becomes muffled and most of the quality is lost when only one earbud functions properly
Sadly I will only give them two stars because they stopped working properly after 2-3 months
only down side  is eventually one ear bud completely loses sound
in most cases it is unrepairable
had that happen with these and various pairs of skull candy earphones
I used these to replace trashed iPhone buds
Obviously a large upgrade in that department
These things are extremely bright and have an obvious lack of depth in comparison to my x11's
I still enjoy them for what they are and would recommend them in that respect
These were purchased as a means to replace the stock Apple Earpods and I can conclusively say that they are a marked improvement
The bass is nice and punchy without being too bloated, although that changes a bit when you push the volume too high (not that you should be listening to music that loudly to begin with)
They come bundled with three sizes of earbud tips which are great for me as I have small ears and most tips I find are simply too rounded to fit in my ears, so I have to give them credit for having a comfortable fit
Obviously these earbuds are not going to please the audiophile in your life for $34 (at time of review) but if you're just looking for an upgrade from your default headphones, you can't go wrong for the price
Make sure to read the description of the product
I didn't expect it to have an asymmetrical cord but it worked out for the best
These are great for everyday use and working out, as they do not slip out of the ear
They also have great sound quality
I would recommend this to a friend
HIgh quality sound, strong bass, nice mids, stock buds that come on are a bit big for my ears but 3 sizes come with it so that was no issue
Wonderful buy for the price
These are fantastic earbuds, I lost my other Vmoda earbuds (~$80) somewhere and needed a replacement
Well these are great earbuds
The sound is excellent, and the bass is not lacking at all, it is actually pretty powerful
They are also pretty comfortable
The only complaint I have is that the asymmetrical cord is a little awkward, but once you look passed that these are a great buy
I just replaced these for a lost set of $25 sony earbuds that i was using for years and couldn't be happier
These buds are LOUD
Bass is rich but not overwhelming, mids are punchy, highs are a little flat but can still hear very well
The only thing i don't like is the 1/8" L connector is raised a little bit too high and sits about 1/2" from the device, but other than that everything is living up to sennheisers reputation
For $30 I would recommend and purchase again
Excellent sound, fits pretty well on ear
They come with a nice bag to keep them safe
Gotta love sennheiser
I've had multiple ear bud headphones in the past, always the cheap $20 ones you get at target
Finally decided to splurge and get quality and hands down this is quality
The speakers really do cover a good range not just better bass
The rubber coating on the wires is good quality and feel like they have a low friction coating
Untangling the wires seems to be easier with this pair that with any of the others
The other cool thing was that this has to be the only headphone that I can wear for >4 hours without hurting
I would highly recommend this product
I'm not an audiophile by any means, so perhaps these are'nt the perfect headphones, but for a day to day basis these headphones are very top notch
The bass is pretty nice for the size and everything sounds pretty clear
The asymmetric design was weird for a little while, but once i got used to it i found it strange to use regular symmetric headphones because it so nice to have the cord behind your neck instead of dangling up front
Overall very good headphones and a very good price
To say they are good would be a lie, but saying these are bad would be a lie too
They are not what I was thinking as it reads "Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds"
The sound response is med rang at best
There is a bit a static sound with some songs and that is NOT do to under powering or overpowering the small speaker
JVC or Boss on the high in of price are a better sound for your buck
I was thinking that these earbuds would be OK to try for the price as we all know that none of these things last for long with active people
Who likes to bust out sixty to eighty bucks for new earbuds a year now days
You get what you pay for with these
For the price i paid @$25 for these ears buds are great for the price
but for the buds to be retailed at $80 definitely would not recommend buying that high
Reasoning is the Quality of the cord, and sound
Lots of low end ear buds now adays have better noise canceling than these buds
The other sound issue i have is when i Work out with them, Cord noise is one of the most annoyingest thing ever
This is a Sennhesier Review but i would like to compare these buds with my Klipsch s5i which hits pretty hard in all sound quality your looking for
Cording on these buds feels very cheap and easily tangled
when i take the earbuds out form the casing it tangles immediatelyI would say overall these buds are one of the best sounding ones out there, The cording and cord noise deterred me from ranking it a 4 or 5
If your using it for everyday usage that's not  physically challenged like running this is the Ideal earbuds for you
Look im no audiophile but i constantly listen to music on my iphone and I know what decent earphones sound like
Destroys far more expensive buds AND they are sturdy
Ive dropped hundreds on buds over the years, maybe a grand in total
These things are THE BEST
Do not hesitate on this purchase
These are my portable audio buds of choice despite having bombed tons of cash on other highly touted and outrageously priced ones
My absolute favorite Klipsch Image S4's finally gave up their last breath after 3 years
Foolishly I decided to try something new rather than buy an exact(ish) replacement
Ugh
Bad sound in one ear from day one
In process of returning to Amazon
For me the asymmetrical cord is just awful
I suppose it's a personal preference thing
What ends up happening is all of the weight of the cord (I know, it's not that much weight) ends up being held by one ear bud rather than distributing that weight between two ear buds
If the ear buds are already a slightly bad fit, this ends up pulling them out frequently
I also found that the amount of cord on the short side was much too short so it would be tugged at when I turned my head
Over all not a great experience at all
My new Klipsch headphones should be waiting for me at home today
I'm a sennheiser fan and using sennheiser HD 429 headphone for last 4 years and still working good
And I got needs for replacing my old Galaxy S2 earphone which is really good but cords is nearly broken
Cons:nice bassnice mids and highs (clear sounds)Pros:tiny cord
I cannot say I am a discriminating user but for the price, these buds sound great to me
And are not uncomfortable as so many are
I recommend them
I replaced my Bose earbuds with cx300's
It's hard to beat Bose for sound and bass response however, I was not willing to spend $100
00 to buy another pair
The Sennheiser's are very comfortable and the overall sound and bass response are sufficient for my needs
I feel these earbuds are an excellent replacement based on value and performance
I would recommend them to friends and family
Using these for one and a half years
They are good earbuds
One earbud blew out, not what I was expecting from Sennheiser, I've used their products for years, these were just cheaply made all around
Excellent sound, fits pretty well on ear
They come with a nice bag to keep them safe
Gotta love sennheiser
I've had multiple ear bud headphones in the past, always the cheap $20 ones you get at target
Finally decided to splurge and get quality and hands down this is quality
The speakers really do cover a good range not just better bass
The rubber coating on the wires is good quality and feel like they have a low friction coating
Untangling the wires seems to be easier with this pair that with any of the others
The other cool thing was that this has to be the only headphone that I can wear for >4 hours without hurting
I would highly recommend this product
Pros:  Sound quality is pretty good for the money
Sealed ear canal design shuts out most ambient noise
Cons:  Not good for running
Sealed ear canal design makes it where you can hear a low frequency thud every time your foot hits the ground
For me, that ruined the listening experience, and it was irritating
Even with the different sizes of rubber seals, they are fairly comfortable, but not great
This is the second time I have decided to go cheap instead of buying another popular brand for $99
These don't work for me for running, and the sound quality isn't quite what I wanted
For me, I think I need to pay the extra money
These are pretty good for this price range, unless you are planning to use them to run (see above)
Some of the highs are a little absent, but I think it is probably quite a design task to reproduce the higher frequencies correctly on this sealed design without blowing your ear drums out
For any use other than running, I consider these pretty good at this price range
For comparison, I would just barely rate them better than the iPhone ear buds
I like them they are good headphones for the price
The wires are really flimsy tho
get tangled very easily
There is little to no bass, yes i inserted them into my ear properly and the highs are muffled
Apple earbuds are better dont waste your money please
I don't exercise with these, so I can't comment on how well they stay in my ear for various physical activity
While walking though, they stay in very well and are comfortable
The sound quality is several times better than the stock Apple earphones
It was time to replace an old pair of KOSS buds that had a great sound and excellent bass response
The Senns are good for the price point, they have a good bass response
However, the midrange levels are a bit tinny for me and tend to be a little over powering
Overall not too bad
They sound good, good lows and mids, decent highs
Better for music with a lot of lows obviously, can strain under soprano lyrics in classical music unfortunately
can't go wrong with these earbuds
great sound all around at a perfect price point
I wont bother writing up a review as many others have already done it
I am a audiophile and these meet my needs for what I use them for
Dont compare them to non-earbud style headphones
they are not similar by any needs
compare them to other earbuds
If you don't like earbuds in general then don't buy them
Buy over the ear headphones instead
Sound is pretty good but I can't tell the difference between my skull candy buds that were half the cost
The friggin cord drives me nuts, as other have stated the right ear bud is longer so that you can drape the cord behind-the-neck as a safety feature"
well it's a stupid design and very frustrating
The only reason I use them is because I can't justify spending $$ and letting them lay around
They will be replaced hopefully sooner than latter
Great sound, excellent value, couldn't judge the durability because none of the earbuds included would stay in my ear so I had to return
A flat cord would be a plus
Sound not equal to Klipsch S4's but hopefully these would have lasted longer
I've owned Sennheiser earphones since 1975, always a good product
The newest headphones are terrific, in comparison to earbuds, all I can say is thank God for equalizers
Earbuds are good for travelling, light weight, easily stored in a pocket or purse and with the carrying case, won't get tangled with everything else
Haven't tried other brands, so can't compare low or high end to these buds
However, without an eq, these would be useless to me, they produce strong high end frequencies that can irritate your drums
And nearly every song needs to be tweeked to get rid of he raspy sound to blend a balanced mid range that fills up the normal listening range
Some songs have so much bass, they clip the buds creating, pops and buzz, with an eq, its controllable and eliminates the noise without turnng down the volume
Since this is the first time listening to  'good' earbuds, and Sennheiser claims these have 'Enhanced bass', again without an eq to boost the bass, I wouldn't even know it was there
I'll use them on flights to block out jet engine noise, but for casual listening, I'll stick with my HD428's for superior sound distribution
I have purchased these headphones four times because they are absolutely amazing
I use them probably ~70 hours a week (rough use) so they hav ea tendency to have one side go out on me and I end up having to buy a new pair
The have an excellent price point for such an excellent set of headphones
Until i find something better for the price, I will continue to purchase these headphones
Sound is smooth and clear
Both highs and lows, and bass is amazing
Awesome, as always
Bought time and time again, but usually after a good three years hard use, which is fine by me as they're really great and I expect things to wear with time
They don't fit in my ears and keep falling out
It also has one cord longer than the other, so you need to wrap it around the back of your neck
Dissapointed
Yeah the bass part of these earbuds is no joke
After listening to some dubstep my left ear started to hurt XD
Anyways these are just great for the price, highly recommend
Definitely an upgrade from the iHome earbuds i had
its really good in quality and name is enough for sennheiser ear phones
liked the bass of the ear phones
Bought these to replace a set of Ultimate Ears earbuds
I prefer the earbud style, the iPod type don't fit my ears at all
These fit snugly, and come with large and small earpieces for different sized ears
Sound quality is very good
I'm not an audiophile (and have high frequency tinnitus) and these suit me just fine, with pretty solid bass response
The plug has a right angle orientation which is actually nice, as it creates a shallower profile against my phone
Right and Left are clearly visible as silver print on a black background
I was a bit puzzled as to why the wire to the right bud was so much longer than the left
Quick Google search informed me that the right one is designed to go around the back of your head
Seems a little odd, but isn't a problem once you get used to it
Shipping was fast, as usual
I have tried & returned countless ear buds over the past few months (including Bose, Klipsch with bass boost, JLab, Sony, and ME Electronics) and have FINALLY found the perfect sound - not too much treble, just enough bass to sound rich without drowning out or thumping through non-R&B songs, and the perfect level of noise isolation without the ear buds being so large that they start to hurt the inside of my ears after wearing them for more than a half hour
Love, love, LOVE these
great sound and with the smallest ear adapter (have extra small ear canals) they stay in my ears while exercising on the stationary bike or treadmill
The cord length is more than adequate plus the different length (left ear cord is shorter than the right) for the ear pieces  works well
This was a great buy for my needs - I am very satisfied
Thanks Amazon

These headphones are well worth the cost
Perfect fit, great sound, and a great quality for the price point
5 stars
I got these as a decent pair of ear buds at a decent price
I don't listen to a ton of music so i figured these would fit the bill
All in all I used them for 2 hours or so a week for 3 months, and they've crapped out
No physical damage
Just no music through the speakers
You can do worse than these ear buds for 30$, but I strongly recommend you try to do better
I needed something for work and this worked quite nicely
Pretty good bass and clear sound
I can see why these rate so well on amazon
These earbuds have outstanding bass response, deep and convincing
The highs are crisp and clean
It captures all the drama fine, but the midrange is unrealistically recessed in relation to the bass and treble, especially at moderate volume and above, so capturing all of the vocal magic requires cutting back a bit on the bass and lower treble to restore a realistic balance for these buds to really shine
In its un-equalized state, it's like the buds are determined to be overdramatic and over-act
:DThis is somewhat nit-picky because it's easier to EQ down something that's  too present (too much bass and treble here) than to try to boost components that are missing, possibly because the device can't produce any more
The passive noise reduction is pretty good too
Don't expect miracles but they do allow listening at lower volumes in noisy environments, which can save your hearing in the long run
NR effectiveness is somewhat a function of choosing the correct size ear cups and ensuring a tight seal is formed
Don't be afraid to fiddle with the fit if it isn't forming a tight seal
I'd give this 5 stars because of the excellent sound
After tweaking with EQ, these buds far exceed my expectations for an inexpensive pair of earbuds
For under $50, it's a steal
Would recommend to anyone
Some may love these Sennheiser ear buds as the sound quality is really quite good for the price, but personally I can't stand using them for two reasons:- The perfectly round buds won't stay put in my ear, which is a serious problem with in-ear noise isolating buds like these that need a good tight seal to deliver great sound
- The asymmetrical cord is a huge hassle, with the shorter left wire constantly jerking on the left ear bud (breaking the seal and thus ruining the sound) and the long right wire getting caught on things
I've never liked this cord design and wouldn't have purchased the buds if I knew they had the short/long wire setup
So for me these buds are killed by the form factor, not the sound quality
A shame
If you like round buds and can live with asymmetrical short/long cords, these may be a good purchase for you
If you think not, check out the Klipsch S3 or S4s, which I found to be *far* superior both in sound quality and form factor
The sound is excellent but the build quality is terrible
The ear buds are glued together and it easily falls apart
After about 2 months of mild use there was no sound coming out of one ear bud and it later broke
I don't know if there was something specifically wrong with mine but I would exercise caution when buying them due to the cheap build quality
My beats broke (which i LOVED)
these are a close comparison
I've had some Bose before, and while i'm still in the first 100 hours of listening, so they are not fully broken in, i think they are great
Great base (could be better)
The only thing i do not like, is the fact that if they are turned up loud, you can hear them from the outside
I do not like this, because i work in an office and dont need other people hearing my "TURN DOWN FOR WHAT
"
For general listening, these are good enough, however I'm picky with my sound as I use higher quality over the ear headphones all day
These have a lower output of bass and cut the mids a bit too
I'm not a fan of them, but they work for when I'm on the plane traveling
They are less neutral than I was hoping for
Don't get me wrong, the sound is very, very good, but the mids are a bit hollow compared to my HD580s
I guess my expectations were probably too high for sub $100 earbuds
Very good earbuds
The best that i have ever had
For this money you can't get anything better
They are even better than much more expensive earbuds
I bought these earbuds because I had such a great experience with an older Sennheiser product (PX-100) which were fantastic
A year ago I neded to replace my old Sennheiser earphones and picked a Sony model based on price and review
Recently I felt flush and decider to buy another pair of ear music devices and saw the Sennheiser CX 300 II with a great price and great reviews so I went for it
I received my order and was expecting and excited to hear better sound from these earbuds than my old Sony playing (primarily) classical, electronica and pop music
Wow, was I wrong
At best, they are tinny
Where did all the great reviews come from
Did Sennheiser cost reduce their design and think the buying public wouldn't notice
I would not buy these again
Keep looking
The price is right and the sound quality is above average in my estimation, but yes, its the asymmetrical lengths that got me too in the end
Thinking that those who complained that they were poorly designed weren't allowing themselves to get used to wearing them a little differently, I was like, "yeah these feel good
I was right
"
Unfortunately, after a few weeks, I began realizing that movement in general and especially head movement left and right begins to catch the wires across your shoulders (collars, seams of shirts)
Its really starting to drive me nuts
Also, the wire is average length I believe, but for me was a half foot too long
Im 6 foot so I can imagine a shorter person having to stuff extra in their pocket for sure
I've had my Sennheiser CX300II earbud set for a little over a year
I bought it at the recommendation of my room mate and the AMAZING sale that Amazon had at the time
At first I was extremely disappointed
I had not expected a wrap around the neck right ear bud nor the apparent lack of bass
However, since then, I have used them almost daily and I now have nothing but good things to say about them
The wrap around style helps keep the cord out of my way, as I often wear them while doing homework or working
The lack of bass is made up for by the AMAZING sound quality and sound stage that I have only found with Sennheiser, and they are EXTREMELY durable
I find myself forgetting to check my pockets often, and I've now sent these babies through the washing machine twice
Both times they have come out no worse for wear outside of being incomprehensibly tangled
They still sound, fit, and work great
If I had ever doubted Sennheiser and their line of products, this last cycle washed all doubts away
I will never buy anything but Sennheiser
I love these headphones
i am not a nitpick so i have had no problem using these headphones when running
The sound quality and noise cancellation works wonders on the NYC train (complete noise isolation
)
i have not had any issues in keeping the ear buds in place when sweating and running
However, i was pretty upset when it stopped working after five months of use
It does have a two year warranty so i sent it back directly to Sennheiser and received a new pair within two weeks
at this price range these buds are great
I've used all kinds of earbuds over the years and I destroy them quick
These seem like they will hold up for a while
My only issue is the rubber ends, none of the sizes really make a good seal with my ears, this is pretty common with all earbuds though, some of the brands have great tips but sub-par sound, some have horrible tips and good sound, the CX3300II is in the latter group
If you pair these up with some nice aftermarket tips like the comply tips they sound a lot better
I would have rated a 4 for the first month
Great sound, really comfortable
However, literally one week after the deadline for returning, the right earbud stopped working
Ironic and very disappointing
I am going to have to look for a replacement, and not this one
Hi, I am wearing this headphones for last 8 years
I absolutely love them
Usually, they work for 2-3 years of active use
Sound is amazing for the money
Highly recommended
these sound better than a lot of buds i have tried - the cord is insufferable though
i never understood the 'one side longer than the other' idea - its dumb
if there is not a mic and there is no chance that you will use them as an interface to talk with there is just no excuse for this
As most cords on ear buds, these make noise when you bump them when doing any physical activity - A LOT of noise, more than most
rule these out for jogging for sure
You get famous Sennheiser quality German engineering in these full range high fidelity stereo earbuds
The bass is terrific if you make sure the buds are snugly fitted in your ear canals
They come with three different sizes of silicone cushions to fit various ear canal sizes
They are comfortable enough to sleep with them in place
I enjoy listening to my favorite music while going to sleep
Another advantage of this type of ear bud is that they block out external sounds
This is great for listening in noisy environments, including in bed if your partner snores
However, I cringe when I see people riding bikes or jogging with earbuds in because they can't hear impending sounds of danger, like an approaching car
In California it's a violation to operate a vehicle while wearing headphones of any sort that cover or block both ears
These buds feature the asymmetrical wire design that throws some people off if they have never used them
The longer wire passes behind the neck to the right ear, and the shorter one goes to the left ear
This has the advantage that the weight of the cord is not left totally hanging from the two ear buds but is supported by the wire behind the neck
Another advantage is that you can take the buds out and leave them hanging, supported by the wire behind the neck
I have used this type of Sennheiser bud for several years, though not always the same exact model
I have found that despite the surprisingly thin and light wires, they are well designed to hold up well
Mine typically last between one and two years of daily use
Sennheiser CX 300 II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds are a great bang for your buck
All sounds low, mid and hi are well represented
The bass is there but not overwhelming
It's not the best sound in the world but it's noticeably different than cheap headphones you'd get for $10
I don't want to say that the earbuds are uncomfortable but they are not the most comfortable fit I've had had with earbuds in the past
I'm not a fan of the one short, one long wire for earbuds but that's just a personal preference
All in all, great headphone and because of the price you won't feel horrible for inevitably breaking, losing, or letting a friend borrow indefinitely
They sound great, the bass is good but not overpowering or flashy
Would recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of buds that aren't too expensive
Good sounding headphones, did not realize the right earpiece is longer than the left and I do not like that feature about them
love these ear buds if only it had a microphone
love it brilliant sound louder than i expected
thank to youtube there the ones told me to try these
First I think it is important to note that the Sennheiser CX 300 II have been faked and sold by many for years now
I have a feeling that most of the negative reviews of these headphones is a result of someone being an unfortunate recipient of a pair of these that were not authentic Sennheiser ear buds
I have a hard time believing that anyone could listen to these and have anything negative to say about them
On to my review
As much as I loved the Klipsch Image S4 ii headphones,  I have to say these really do have a FAR superior sound than the Klipsch
the comparison of the two is like when you dont have your headphones plugged in all the way and then you discover this and push the plug all the way in and its sounds so much fuller, and more complete
the Klipsch have great bass,  and highs,  but the middle is very much absent in the Klipsch
These hit the mark perfectly in low, mid, and highs
Also, the Klipsch never seemed loud enough and  I thought that my phone was the problem
I was looking into headphone amplifiers,  but after using the Sennheiser CX300 II this is no longer an issue
Its plenty loud
Just a great purchase overall
They also stay in my ears unlike the Klipsch that I constantly have to push back into my ears while at the gym
I guess the only real drawback to these is the cord noise,  which is going to be the case with any of this type of in ear headphone
I just dont see a better purchase at this price point
Just make sure you are getting an authentic pair of Sennheisers
There are tons of fakes out there
I listen to headphones and earphones a lot, and have a very well trained ear, working in pro audio for several decades
I was hunting for small earphones I can use with portable devices, on planes, and when lying down
these are small enough to lie on, and the fit is pretty good, though getting a tight seal was difficult
I solved the problem with a pair of Comply Foam Tips, improved on the isolation, and get a reliable seal
But the real task was to find neutral, pleasant, and honest sounding earphones
I'd been buying Sennheiser M50i sets for a few years, kept breaking them, repairing them, breaking them, and replacing them
Probably bought 5 pairs
I wanted something that was built better, and these seem a bit more robust
The cord quality is much better
They don't have the mic an button the M50i has, and frankly, the are a little more boosted in the mid range, but not too bad
Audyssey Amp makes these world class, if you can use it
It remains to be seen how well they last, but so far, I like them a little better than the M50i and WAY better than the Shure SE315 and SE215, which I tried and reviewed here as well
The sound quality is great but the asymmetrical cord tends to be awkward for any type of exercise or activity one moves constantly during
Ordered these for husbands' birthday, he grumbled as he opened them (as he hasn't had good luck with ear buds)
He LOVES them, especially because he can REMOVE the rubber ear protectors and they STAY in his ears
THANKS FOR OFFERING THESE GREAT EAR BUDS :-)
The sound is clear had them for a few months still brand new
comes with a nice leather pouch so dont get tangled or lost

They are durable and have great sound quality
He researched them and is very happy
It would have been nice if they came with more ear pieces though
I tried these after getting strong recommendations from two different friends and have not been disappointed
I highly recommend them
Good Buds
clear sound reproduction for music and talk
I would reccommend these to anyone who wants good sound reproduction
very good sound
ear fit is very good
i cant keep making up words to tell how much i like the ear budes
I have owned a few different pairs of buds from the very bass-heavy like "Soul" by some hip hop artist, to some Sony's that were supposed to be decent and well balanced but ended up being very disappointing
I am so glad I took a chance on these ear buds
I wasn't sure just because of the price being so low and affordable for a decent pair of in-ear's, but pleasantly surprised is a big understatement
I listen to a lot of bass-heavy tunes, but I also listen to stuff like Cold Play, Ed Sheeran, and other alternative pop/rock so I absolutely don't want a pair of headphones that drown out the rest of the spectrum with too heavy and overbearing low frequencies
These fit the bill very nicely
I'm sure you could spend a few hundred dollars more and get better headphones, but I'm confident you wont find better in-ear headphones for under $100 that can offer the incredible lows that these things produce while delivering very clear mids and highs
Only reason I knocked off a star is, if your excising or doing some really physical activity I have to re-position the buds in my ears somewhat frequently
There are remedies for this though such as aftermarket foam tips
I personally do not like the foam tips I think they absorb to much sound reducing the quality of the music, but a good option if your running for sure
I've owned these buds for awhile now, at least 6 months and they just seem to get better and better
Buy these
You will not be disappointed
Good item for the price
Nothing crazy amazing but the seem to be reliable and good sound quality a can cancel out some outside noise better than some other generic apple headphones
*Note that the lengths of the wires connecting the left and ride earbuds to the center cable, the right side is about twice as long
I am not sure why, maybe they want it so the cable to rest behind you neck instead of dangle in front of it which has never been an issue for me
Overall they seem like nice headphones for me, don't do out and buy the fancy version, the $20 pair of these work just fine
I trust other people on here that seem to praise the sound quality and I am happy with the purchase overall
And since they were only $20, who knows - maybe I will invest in another new pair of earbuds and compare the two in a few months time
I sure wish larger over the ear (bose type) were highly acceptable in the office setting
At least where I work small and discrete is the only way you can go
Oh well, good purchase
4/5
The Bass in these headphones are SWEET
However there is 2 Cons to these badboys
1
the wrap around wire is kinda annoying
& 2
the high end is not as crisp as i would like it to be
This is the best bang for your buck
After hearing a friend rave about these headphones, I decided to order a pair for myself
The different earbud sizes were great, they fit my ears and drowned out noise
However, the pair I received died within 2 hours of use - audio only coming out of one earbud
Amazon replaced the product immediately and without hassle
The 2nd pair lasted about 3 uses before the same problem occurred
However, it waited to do so until I was outside the period of returning the 2nd set of headphones
Reliability sucks, and the audio quality isn't any better than a pair of Sony headphones I've had for about a year and a half that are still going stron
Cord is at least 8" too long
For me earbuds are portable this cord is extremely long and gets caught on everything
I'm not the biggest guy but I imagine that its too long for the average person (5 foot cord buy my estimates)
They also designed the L and R buds (right cord is at twice the length of the left) with different lengths and this causes all the weight to go on one ear and the other chord ends up curling and looks really dumb
You cant adjust when the cords meet up to fix this
Extremely frustrating product
I hope this saves someone else the pain I have gone through
Also had issues with them sealing in my ear which feels very weird
Have not had this problem with any previous buds
Oh they sound great for 30$
My favorite earbuds ever
Plus the warranty is the bomb
I had these fray on the cord and one ear stopped working
Forgot all about it for a few months and got a new pair
Then I remembered and I had a month left on the warranty
Sent it in and received a brand new pair
Sennheiser has a great customer support and Warranty
I was very disappointed in the quality of these earbuds
Bass quality was way lower than expected
I also didn't care for the way they fit into my ears
I usually buy my earbuds from Radio Shack but had read a lot of promising reviews on these so thought I'd try them
These headphones right out of the box feel extremely cheap And look like you could get them on a clearance isle at the dollar store
Another major issue is that one headphone wire is extremely shorter than the other, making the headphones look like they were cut off And re attached 3-5 inches shorter than the other headphone
Another issue is that the headphones are very small And are hard to put in your ear
However, the sound of the headphones are good And the bass is great
The price was cut down 7% after a while And the package arrived 4 days earlier than expected
I wouldn't recommend these, unless you need headphones ASAP
I've had these headphones for a few weeks now
I use them at work and while I'm at the gym
In both places they work extremely well
The cord doesn't prove to be a hassle at all, and the sound is crisp and clear
The ear pieces fit snugly without causing discomfort over time
At this price, I am very satisfied
If you are looking for good headphones in the $30-$50 range, I can't recommend these enough
In short, the CX 300 II's  are terrible
Lots of hiss and static
I bought these to replace an el-cheapo set of Plantronics headphones but playback through Plantronics is far superior
If these cost less than $8 maybe
but at $34 they are way over priced for the quality
I have owned a pair of Sennheiser  CX 300 earbuds for the last two years
They are phenomenal ear buds for those who love to hear the low end bass notes however this second pair that I just bought while delivering a great sound do not have the same wire gauge thickness
The wire is so small I am expecting them not to be as durable as my older pair
I use mine to listen to music when I work out at the gym and I will catch the wire on a piece of equipment once or twice a month
I'm concerned that this new set of earbuds will rip all too easily for as thin as they are
Hope I'm wrong if they ever get snagged on something
I bought this to replace the cx300-b's that I broke
the cx300-b is discontinued and by the model number and price these seemed liek their successor
The sound is good but not as good as my old cx300-bs
Maybe my ears are just too big or I'm too critical but every pair of in-ear earbuds I try sound like tinny junk
If I use the largest fitting and fiddle with the position in my ear, I can get these to sound okay and perhaps that's all I should expect from sub $50 earbuds
I've never usedany high-end earbuds so I don't know if its even possible for in-ear earbuds to work well for me
These and the Klipsch PK line just don't work for me
I was trying to replace my Yuin PK3s which I lost and I wanted something that would stay in my ear better while working
I should have stuck with PK3's which sound much, much better (for me at least)
If fitted properly, maybe these buds work well for some people but they're just so harsh on the highs, devoid of mids, and weak on the lows
It doesn't matter what I listen to (orchestral, jazz, classic rock, pop, etc
) I'll go back to the PK3s for working around the house (and my Grado SR125s for "sit-down" listening)
Honestly, I wasn't expecting that much
My son hijacked my last set of ear buds and I needed a new pair
I really wasn't looking to spend an arm and a leg; so, I thought I would try to find a pair from a well known manufacturer for a decent price
I personally think I hit the jackpot
Sennheiser has been making headphones forever and has a good reputation in that department and I have a pair of Sennheiser wireless headphones I use for watching TV (see my other review) and really liked the sound and quality
So, I bought these and thought they would be OK
I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they were amazingly musical
No, they don't have the bass of a subwoofer but if you expect that from ear buds
well
you know
At any rate, they reproduce the music you're familiar with exactly as you remember it
Personally, that's all I can ask
PS
There is the thing about the left ear bud cord being a bit shorter than the other one
Most of the time that's not a issue when you're listening and besides it makes it really easy to tell which is which even without your glasses
Really good quality, I thoroughly enjoyed them
They lasted a week before my sisters stupid guinea pig ate them :/
Separation of channels is not perfect, but Bass response is good, and for the price the overall sound quality is great
Certainly beats any 12 buck Sony earbuds I have been using so far
The fit is great, and it's comfortable even when you are sleeping on the side with them in your ear
Directing the right earbud behind your neck (rather than the wires meeting in front of you) may take some getting used to, but it does really help especially if you are doing work around the house or in a workshop, my headphone wire don't get caught on stuff anymore
The wires are some sort of soft silicone-y material that does not harden in cold climates (like PVC does), but they still tend to get tangled up in your pocket, so not perfect
The earbud drivers are 17
3 and 17
1 Ohms total as seen from the jack, and the wire inside the insulation is very very thin stranded wire strengthened by strands of silk
I got the CX 300 II in the end of October after some research
The sound I great, the bass is what I expected and the over all build was what I wanted
Used them manly for work in the office so very little stress, I thought i found the perfect ear buds that would last over 6 months
But alas it was not meant to be just as the Bose ones before it they did not last
The right side stopped working and with no visible kinks on the cord; I am perplexed how just a day before they worked great
Time to try another brand hopefully they can make it a year
I own several brands of earbuds but my 2 favorite pair are the CX200 and these CX300 II
The 300's are really sharp and clear with bass thats ok
When i first started using them I thought they were almost too bright but I think that's largely due to the CX200 being so bass heavy
If they hold up as long as my CX200's i'll be a happy camper
I love these earbuds
I like a lot of bass in my music and these sound great without any distortion
I'd definitely recommend these
Terrific value, great bass sounds, these are wonderful earbuds
I recently took these earbuds, instead of my larger noise canceling earphones, on an overseas trip, and was really happy with how well they performed
Great buy
My v moda buds which i think were great just started shorting out so i gave these buds a try they are better than the v modas imo the separation is suberb and they are much more clearer sounding while giving up a tiny amount of bass if any at all i'm sure these will only get better after break in the key to these in ear buds are the fit no matter how well they sound and for some reason they fit better than the v modas never working their way loose on me try em i think you will like them
I love these so much more than clunky huge headphones
They're about a million times better than the cheap white buds that come with ipods
They block everything out and nobody else can hear what you're listening too
for this price, i was expecting a lot more
compared to other earbuds on amazon, for the same price, the quality is not even close
seriously
i mean these are not the worst earbuds on the planet, so i'll give it 2 stars instead of one, but for this price - i feel ripped off
(i bought 3 different earbuds on the same day, just test, and these were the poorest quality)
Nothing to complain about these earbuds
Sennheiser quality sound
The pouch is a big big plus to carry around for travel
These headphones are awesome
The sound was amazing and the noise cancellation that they provided was beyond expectations
I just wish they had lasted
Bought them in December and by March the cable for left ear frayed
Not sure if I want to purchase them again
The quality of sound is great, and the fit of the buds is also nice, and you have options
The unfortunate part about these is that the cable is such junk you might as well not buy them
It's about as thin as a toothpick, fragile and one side is longer than the other (which I understand has a purpose) making it really uncomfortable to use
They're always falling out of one ear due to the unequal length, or getting hooked on my arm as I walk, or getting stuck in a zipper
It's just a poor design all around
Had the cable been different, I'd give it 5 stars
I have 3 pairs of these, 1 I use and 2 in reserve
They have excellent sound and the take well to equalization
If you like thumping bass and clear highs these are the ticket
If you like jazz, classical, etc, you can easily dial down the bass and adjust the middle and top a bit for more "flat" listening
They have a high SPL rating so they'll play loud with not so powerful sources, and the bass will having you looking around for the subwoofer
I can drive these to incredible levels with my Nuforce uDAC 2 and they play loud and clear
I could take or leave the uneven cable lengths
The added carry case comes in handy, and if you take care of these they will last a long time
My first pair is 2 years old and I use them a lot
Satisfied with sound quality, good headphones, case is necessary thing, its a good buy for its price I think so
It's a decent pair of earphones for the price I paid
They are not as loud as my Klipsch s4, but still not bad
They have a weird fit on my ear, but overall a good product
As many other reviewers noted, the wires are extremely noisy
As they brush against your clothing or each other they create a very disturbing interruption to an otherwise nice sounding set of earbuds
They buds themselves fit nicely and do a good job of blocking out your noisy cube neighbors
If these had been at the retail price I'd given them one star
If they'd been $12 earbuds I'd have given them three
On the low registers, these sound quite good, but when the treble comes in they are screechy
I'm quite generous in my ratings, but these are a definite do not buy
Not willing to pay a lot for earbuds or headphones, I'll stick with my Apple earbuds
They are not perfect, but for the money, they do a nice job
I do not work for Apple or any retailer, no do I have anything against Sennheiser
These sound better than the beats headphones I threw away (which was why I needed them to begin with)
I know that there are likely better sounding headphones and more durable headphones
but for the money
these perform extremely well
love them
great purchase//// have ordered more
great sound purchased mainly for warranty
will hopefully not need to use it
I love Sennheiser products because of their great sound and long lifespan
These pairs were just as great sounding as the other Sennheiser earphones that I have used but I was disappointed to find that these pairs only lasted 7 months (which is still pretty long compared to other brands) until one side of the earphones stopped working
However, for its price, I believe I got my money's worth
I know people that are experts, I am not one of them
that being said omg the sound out of these puppies is awesome
I first got them out of the package and ho hum they fall out nothing special
but changed the ear bud size and they fit perfect
no fall out and room noise limited
then the music came
oh my
nice bass, full range of sound
I couldn't  wear them for work because they are too perfect
I was  scared I would ruin them
sweat and dust
answer
buy a second pair
and that's why I only gave them 4 stars
I was forced to buy a second pair
damn Sennheiser
they got me addicted
oh and by the way I wear mine for work now, no problems the second pair are still in the package
and if you ask do I recommend these to others
no need
I just say try these
and they are sold
there is a reason they are one of the top ten ear buds
even a smuck like me can tell the difference
Ok, to be fair, I'm really picky
With that being said, these ear buds are uncomfortable
I don't think the sound quality is all that great
Now, I know for some, paying $40 or whatever I paid for these ear buds isn't a lot - and I agree
But when a pair of $8 Sony ear buds are more comfortable and about the same sound quality that's a problem for me
I wanted to like these, but I couldn't
I tried to give them to a friend when her ear buds crapped out on her at work one day - and even she returned them to me and told me they were terrible
My suggestion - go with something else
These aren't worth it
The sound was horrible with the original rubber ear pieces
It sounded a little better when I used the largest ones but not much
I found that if I pressed them into my ear and held them there the sound was great so it seems to be more as issue with the fit than actual sound quality
I also do not like the fact that the cable on one ear bud was twice as long as the other and the wire seems cheap and tangle prone
I would not recommend these phones
The packaging for the earbuds was the first problem, by the time I got it open I'd flung some of the extra tips across the room
Typical terrible electronics packaging, but then they decided to glue and tape things together on top of it
Aside from that, They claimed to have "noise isolation", which was very overstated
Nowhere near the noise isolation I'm used to from more canalphone styles
Top it off with the earbuds sounding tinny, and you have one very dissatisfied customer
I love these ear buds, both my fiance and myself own a pair
I listen to every genre of music regularly, these are what I like to throw in my pocket when I know there will be downtime because of their small size and sleek covenient travel pouch
sound:These have a very good tone to the sound they put out,  im not going to falsely advertise these as a high end headphone with "crystal" clear highs
The bass is not overpowering, but still very strong and very responsive ,  below 100hz, and even below 60hz
Although you'll get more thump from $20 skullcandys, the bass is very muddy in comparison and i would feel its 20 dollars wasted compared to these
Everything in between the lows and highs comes through these headphones wonderfully as well
I've never been able to hear any distortion from these, no matter how heavily I push them
And that reliability is my personal #1 thing to look for in a headphone because that means it will continue to perform just like they did on day one throughout the years
For the price, the sound is outstanding to say the least but if you're  a teenager looking for nothing but pure muddy bass,  just buy some cheap skullcandys
Durability-im in then United States Marine Corps Infantry
Purchased these before my first deployment,  now I'm currently on my 3rd
Nuff said
Ie, if you manage to break these, consider yourself very irresponsible
I cant count the number of times ive taken these to the field, or accidentally washed them
theyre tougher than they lookoverall, this is an awesome buy, great, reliable, durable on-the-go headphones
I give 4 stars bc they could always be louder, clearer and cheaper but I definitely recommend
I like it very much
Music became more beautiful
When I put it in my ears I felt it comfortable
Excellence sound response in all the right frequencies
High quality earphones for price value
Can't go wrong with these earphones
These headphones have excellent sound quality and the bass is phenomenal
The ear buds conform great to the ear and are very comfortable
Durability is great compared to a pair of Sony headphones that only lasted me 1 month
Cord is at least 8" too long
For me earbuds are portable this cord is extremely long and gets caught on everything
I'm not the biggest guy but I imagine that its too long for the average person (5 foot cord buy my estimates)
They also designed the L and R buds (right cord is at twice the length of the left) with different lengths and this causes all the weight to go on one ear and the other chord ends up curling and looks really dumb
You cant adjust when the cords meet up to fix this
Extremely frustrating product
I hope this saves someone else the pain I have gone through
Also had issues with them sealing in my ear which feels very weird
Have not had this problem with any previous buds
Oh they sound great for 30$
My favorite earbuds ever
Plus the warranty is the bomb
I had these fray on the cord and one ear stopped working
Forgot all about it for a few months and got a new pair
Then I remembered and I had a month left on the warranty
Sent it in and received a brand new pair
Sennheiser has a great customer support and Warranty
Ssennheiser is synonym of quality, Amazing sound for such small buds, recommended for daily use in outdoors, basses are good
I love Senns
I actually own some HD650 and the RS120s
I needed some easy travel earbuds and got these
They sound great, but I just couldn't get used to how deep they go in the ear
They work fine for what they do, but not my preference
on a low quality budget
Very solid sound
Nothing negative to report
You wont find anything better for around 20 bills
I was always buying those $10-15 earphones and they would always break after a month or two, so I finally decided to spend a little more on a more substantial pair and I'm so glad that I chose these
What I really like about them is the noise-isolation they provide
Awesome pair of in ear headphones, awesome quality, bass sounds amazing and it doesn't overwhelm the treb and mid at all
Highly recommend those who are looking at these and don't know whether or not to buy them, stop thinking and just buy them
Definitely worth it
I chose two stars because of how poorly these are made
yes the sound is perfectly fine
but the buds themselves are so tiny
I let a few of my friends try them on and they would not stay in anyone's ears
They would get gross and oily no matter how clear your ears were and they would push air into your ear making a clicking and uncomfortable pressure
I was really enthusiastic because of the price and how they sounded
but be aware
In my opinion these are a rip off
Spend your money on good quality and don't waste your money here
It was so cheap and I loved it, the quality of the sound is so good, and the wire is just long enough for me to put it in my jeans pocket
good quality for the price
However, I own the in-ear $100 Bose set and those deliver much better bass
Otherwise, these are a great set of in-ear affordable pair
If you are looking for the best sound quality, go for the On-ear Sennheiser
I own a pair of the noise cancelling model and they sound way better than their Bose counterpart
I use CX 300 mostly for running and sports
Buy a new pair every 2-3 years, usually one of the wires is broken or the connector
Once CX 300 were sold for about 20 $ and today the price is about 30 $
The new version has a different shape with silver logo, but feel the same (also the sound)
The cable is different and now the connector has a plastic mold on it for protection
Also now it has a small black PU leather bag with a spring that keeps it close, it's usefull when you put the headphones there
I say if you find them at about 30 $ - it's a good purchase, I would get 2-3 pairs
If you get a discound find them at about 20 $ - buy a dozen, it's exelent for personal usa and as a present
BE CAREFUL , make sure you buy the original product and not a fake (MADE IN CHINA)
Response is good
Great product for the price
As a bass and keyboard player it works very well for both applications
VERY GOOD PRODUCT
I have used the ear buds provided by Apple for iPods along with a few I purchased on my own
I was in no way prepared for this sound experience
It was incredible
I can't speak for people that live for their sound systems, but regular users will not be disappointed if their buds work like mine
These earbuds deliver a crisp, clean sound, and I was pretty surprised that they diminish background noise better than my Beats by Dre earbuds
My only complaint is that it does not enhance the bass
Other than that, I'm very satisfied with this purchase
I use these when riding my motorcycle
I use a large full face shoei helmet and these earbuds fit in my ears perfectly with and without the helmet on
I'd recommend these to anyone who enjoys good sounding bass clear mids and great highs
And who likes to ride while listening to music
stupid asymmetrical designbox states 19 - 21,000 Hz, Amazon description states 42 - 17,000 Hz
So which is it
cord makes noise
I went from Apple earpods, and these can't even compare
I bought these because I own a pair of Sennhesier 558's, and those rock
These things are just really terrible
The sound is muffled, bass heavy, and generally bad
Coulda spent 5 less and got another pair of earpods from Apple
Oh well
These sound fantastic for the price
Sennheiser makes high quality products
They also come with a nice carrying case that keeps them from being damaged if put in bag or pocket
UPDATE:The right ear has suddenly stopped working
It says it has a 2-year warranty but I am not sure how to make a claim
I listen to music while biking every single day
These are my 4th pair of these headphones
Normally they last me about a year before some of the wiring goes or I get them caught on my bike or whatever
The sound on these is great and the fit is perfect
I like these most because they don't give me the whooshing sound when biking
Normally I get wind noise from earbuds but the profile on these is low enough that it isn't an issue
These ear buds have a natural uncolored sound
They are not heavy bass or overly bright
just clean natural sound
I use the for watching movies with a media player
Great for dialog
works just as good for music
I wish the cord was the same length to each earbud
Good bass background beatLoops around the neckMultiple earbuds to fit different types of earsOverall it sounds great
I can only seem to get any set of earbuds I buy to last for 3-6 months
That said, these are a good value and sound great
My new pair of Sennheiser CX300 II earbuds do not sound good with a wide range of music or audio books
The "S" sounds are harsh, and that sibilance is annoying
I bought a cheap pair of JVCs at Wal-Mart to finish the week, that's how bad they were
The bass response isn't great
The small soft case is awesome--perfect size and the metal spring mouth is secure without the hassle/tangling of drawstrings or zippers
I'll use it with the next pair of earbuds I buy
I've had both better bass response and better sibilance with the cheaper Sony MDR-EX210B they tried to replace
The Sonys didn't have the clearest mid-range, but I could wear them for hours without physical or audible discomfort
Unfortunately, the EX210Bs fell and got drug the floor in a rodent-infested room
I'm not putting them back in my ears no matter how I try to clean them
Sadly, they don't seem to be available any more
The search continues
I've had a pair of Sennheiser HD 212 Pros for 10 years and am constantly amazed how well they perform at such a low-end price
I wanted some headphones that were a bit more discrete for daily professional use, so I chose these in-ear buds based reputation and reviews
Perhaps I am spoiled by other higher-end headphone purchases, but these didn't even match the quality of the stock ipod earbuds
They have decent bass, but at the expense of muddying the rest of the frequencies
I gave them some time to burn in, but still no improvement
If you just want a punch bass sound and aren't quite as concerned with soundstage, detail, etc
, then I can see these being an OK purchase
Not quite what i was expecting though
I would have given 5 starts but for some reason they made the wire on one side much longer than the other
Maybe good for someone 12 feet tall
But the sound is incredible
These are some of the best headphones I've ever bought
I have lots and lots of different buds, but none come anywhere near the quality of these
Purchased this product about 4 months ago
About 3 months after purchase no sound would register out of the left ear bud
Two weeks thereafter it stopped working all together
Not worth the high price
Would recommend a cheaper product
I am a religious Shure user, so when my set had to go in for warranty work, I bought the Sennheiser CX 300IIs to hold me over
I am the type to do 2 days of research before I buy anything, these get great reviews-- and they deserve it
Mids are decent and lows are very "solid" for this price point
Highs aren't too shabby either
They fit great, the "athletic" setup takes a little bit to get used to, but it works well
I use my headphones everyday, these worked great for me
If you are using cheap earbuds or, god forbid, the free earbuds that came with your device, order these immediately
I ordered these after doing a thorough search and reading reviews, plus my son has Sennheiser earbuds and likes them
Well, these are ok
I really wanted to love these but I don't
I do like the different size options as they do stay put in my ear while on the treadmill
I don't run but I do walk fast and this is where my problem lies
As the chord moves with me I hear the movement in my ear and it drives me crazy
I have tried repositioning the bud in my ear, moving my ipad, turning up the sound
I can not get it to stop
I am watching video and not listening to music but I still shouldn't be annoyed by the sound
I've actually gone back to wearing bulky headphones which I hate wearing when I'm sweating but the sound is so much better
The earbuds thrown in with the ipad sound better than these do but I can't get them to stay in my ear
Glad I didn't pay a fortune for these
Is the best choice for someone search a cheap earbuds with a amazing bass, aren't bigger and colorful, are little and elegant for people that want good sound and not a "cool" stylish like the crap of beats audio
Comes with 3 pairs of buds (S,M,L) and a bag for save
A negative point is the package, a blister-pack and is hard to unpackage, spatially who love saving boxes products purchased
These earbuds offer great sound quality for the price point
Not as nice as some of the over the ear cans I have, but for earbuds they're great
I love Sennheiser for their great quality and this product is no exception
I have been a Sennheiser fan since the mid 70's and I always will be,these are very nice for the money and the sound is crisp and clear,nice bass very defined, excellent
Bought it for a year
Hasn't broken down yet lol
The sound quality is ok
Come on, it's just $30 so can't expect it sounds like Beats
I know Beats is way too overpriced but honestly I like how their earphones sound cus it's more "real", compare to this CX 300 II, it sounds "warm", not "clear" and "real
"
These are great earbuds
I also own a pair of HD555's and find myself preferring the Ear Buds at time due to the low bass response
I've put them through some good torture testing with an amp as well and they hold their own for how cheap they are
After I purchased it , I won't  consider BEAT, BOSS etc
expensive headsetIt's sounds great and light, very easy to fit , I listen different kind music and I always travel ; I spent 3 hours minimum per week at airport; it's great staff
The only negative point: you need to take break after 1-2 hours ; otherwise, your ear fell uncomfortable due to it fit into inner ear when you use it
I am satisfy with quality and money I paid for
Hands down the best ear buds
Bass is deep and the highs are crisp
Plus they fit into your ear and the ear pierce rubber is soft so it doesn't hurt your ears after 10min of using them
I own 3 pairs of them
They sound fantastic, not as good as headphones, but you get what you pay for
The two different lengthed cables didn't bother me, in fact i prefer this layout as opposed to the normal earbud layout
Would buy again
This earphones are not as as durable as I ever imagined, but the earphones come with the best warranty with great sound
After 3 months of purchase, the earbuds stopped working, so I requested a replacement
My earphones have been replaced in 3-4 days at no cost
Sound is very good, just like you would expect from a Sennheiser product
Please make sure you try them with all 3 sizes of earpieces that they provide even if you think you have a good fit right out of the box
Most bad review of in ear monitors are from lack of bass which means you have a bad fit
Once I had a good fit with the largest of the tips I found the sound to be very good, and much better than I'd expect from such a low priced headphone
We buy earbuds because they allow us to do things while listening, and this is where the Sennheisers fail
The cable is very thin and very lightweight
So much so that I found it getting caught on buttons and collars and anything I seemingly game within 3 feet of
The fact that it is asymmetrical (left cable is shorter than the right) made the whole cable travel the left side of my body rather than the center which provided even more opportunity for the buds to be ripped from my ears as I got out of my car or reached for something
Not to mention that I and the majority of people are right handed, but the cable wouldn't allow you to carry your audio source in your right pocket
There is also a lot of microphonic noise from the cable so every bump and brush is relayed directly and loudly to your ears
I'll toss them in my briefcase for the airplane where their excellent isolation will be appreciated and my seated position should keep me from strangling myself with that crazy, ill-conceived cable
Best quallity for this price, i have them for half year, and no problem, everyday they are in my backpack
verry good
I am like many hardcore audiophiles: I want the best sounding ear buds for the lowest price
The Sonys are exceptional but not perfect
They have a few minor flaws: poor noise isolation (fine if you want to hear whats around you) and fit: my right one seems to come out easily
Sonys have a richer/ more spacious sound due to thier construction
They are only slightly lower in sensitivity: 108 dB (not noticeably)Pros of Sonys: freq resp: 12-22 kHz / huge 16mm drivers fr great bass / very inexpensive: I bought them here under $15 so demand has driven the price up
The price allows me to have several backup pairs in case of loss or a cord gets caught and only one bud continues to work
TECHNICAL DATA IS INCORRECT: SENSITIVITY: 19Hz - 21000HzThe Senns stay in snug but after a while you feel like your ears are plugged up (good for loud or distracting ambient noise)Great for working out
I also wear them when I ride my motorcycle: they stay in
I use the Koss VC20 to make fine adjustments to volume (also has a long crd) and it prevents wear on a device's volume control
Both Sonys and Senns are great values for the money
Yes I agree that you can spend hundreds more for slightly better sound but you will feel like a fool when you lose an expensive pair of buds or they are damaged
The package arrived early so I was pretty happy about that
The whole reason I got the headphones was to have a pair to board around with, they don't slip while running and they sound great
love em
Over all these are pretty good - I purchased them after reading reviews online
My main complaint is that they are a little weak in the bass range and the rubber cord tends to grab clothing (I've had buds with a plastic/smooth coating that doesn't grab cloth)
Like many other folks here, I've been through quite a few earbuds over the past few years, some cheap and some expensive
I'd have to say that these ones are one of the best values I've come across
Sure, there are better sounding sets out there, but at $30
Not too many
Sound is full and the bass is nice compared with some other small models
A little tweaking on the EQ and they sound fantastic
They are also surprisingly comfortable; I've been able to wear them for hours at a stretch and not been bothered at all
The only negative I can come up with is that the wires seem pretty thin and I'm not sure how long it'll last
If you are a little rough on your equipment, I'd take that into consideration
Regardless, I recommend these highly if you're looking for quality sound at a great price
Its a mystery how this product earned 5 stars from many customers
I promised you that this ears bud can't perform any better than Sony or JVC under $20 ears bud
Everything sounds out of place
Bass was so dam weak
I dont even know why dd they bother calling it "Enhanced Bass"If your budget set at $30 try JVC HARX700 (price as of Mar/1/2014 @ Walmart $39 @ Amazon),
http://www
amazon
com/JVC-HARX700-Precision-Sound-Headphones/dp/B0013OWPV4/ref=sr_1_3
s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1396352191&sr=1-3&keywords=jvc+harx500Your ears will thank you for it
Excellent head phones
Sounds quality great with the bass
Just like the other review stated not for running
Left ear side has a shorter distance than the right ear side which is almost 3x times the length
Got this through amazon wherehouse for a better deal
These ear buds produce pretty good sound
However I find them very delicate and don't expect them to last very long
that's why I'm giving them a rating of only 3
On the basis of quality and durability, I would not recommend the ear buds
but on sound quality I would recommend them
Not sure why so many people complain about the bass enhancement; it's barely noticeable to me
Granted, I despise the unadjustable cord length
That's my fault for not reading the specs though
If you can get these for 30-40 bucks, well worth it
They help me survive the LIRR on a daily basis
You can't beat these for the price
That being so, maybe these earphones aren't ideal for non bass punchy genres but, if rap, hard rock, etc is your thing, these earphones are perfect especially considering their price tag
I have been a Sennheiser fan since the mid 70's and I always will be,these are very nice for the money and the sound is crisp and clear,nice bass very defined, excellent
Bought it for a year
Hasn't broken down yet lol
The sound quality is ok
Come on, it's just $30 so can't expect it sounds like Beats
I know Beats is way too overpriced but honestly I like how their earphones sound cus it's more "real", compare to this CX 300 II, it sounds "warm", not "clear" and "real
"
Almost as good sounding as my Sennheiser over the hear headphones
Love these for work as the buds isolate beautifully
Besides my audiophile stereo system, I have a number of audiophile headphones–both in-ear and over-the-ear
These certainly aren't audiophile quality but they're sure really nice for certain situations like my iTouch or my bedside radio, neither of which can put out audiophile sound quality anyway, when I can't sleep at night and don't want to disturb my wife's sleep
For many people, the sound quality would be perfectly suitable and at this price, wow
I bought a bunch of them to put on all our computers and mobile devices
I'm a big fan of Sennheiser
I've used their studio headphones for years
These are decent earbuds
Bass response is good without being too muddy or fart like
Hold up well and get good and loud
While these certainly don't provide the best sound, I am impressed by the quality for the given price
These are great headphones to take to the gym or use for casual listening
The cords don't tear and generally don't get too tangled
The ear buds are comfortable and light
This is my third sennheiser headset
owned a cx-300, a cx-500 and this one
they never fail to please my ears
highly recommended
truly a best buy product
Buy this product a few months ago and only served for 2 months, I really do recommend the product and even covers I want to know if any warranty
Its amazing
I read many reviews and most of them stated very good sound
Clear, crisp highs, smooth deep bass
Yes the highs are there
I like that
Bass response is poor, beyond poor
I purchased an inexpensive Philips in-ear headphone a while back and was totally blown away by the sound right from the start
Never heard about having to burn in headphones, but before I send these back, I'll give them a chance
Update:  I forgot that ear bud size and placement is critical for these in-ear headphones
I switched to the larger size ear buds, inserted these further in and I found myself inside a concert hall
I compared these to the Philips headphone since I had also given one to my mother
She hadn't used hers so they were still new, never used
The sound from these are awesome too, but the Sennheiser has them beat in smoother reproduction, especially on the highs
The highs on the Philips are harsh, almost hurt the ears where the Sennheiser is softer, but still clear and crisp
Bass is good, no better than the Philips which is an older set and didn't advertise enhanced bass
Overall sound is fuller with the midrange being reproduced better on the Sennheiser
Not sure about this though as I prefer midrange to be muted a bit more
Build wise, the Sennheiser has thinner cords than the Philips and I do worry about the durability of the Sennheiser
As far as length and one side cord being longer than the other, I didn't find either to be a problem
Bottom line is for now these are a keeper, but it'll take just one little detail that I'm not happy with and these will go back
bought it for my son's b-day ( gift list)
He absolutely loved the j-cord (asymmetric design)
Sounds great
Definitely a good buy
VERY GOOD PRODUCT
I have used the ear buds provided by Apple for iPods along with a few I purchased on my own
I was in no way prepared for this sound experience
It was incredible
I can't speak for people that live for their sound systems, but regular users will not be disappointed if their buds work like mine
saw prior reviews but was hopeful they had some redeeming quality
The sound is phenomenal
But, I have had these headphones about 2 1/2 weeks and R earpiece stopped working already
Don't waste your money
I was skeptical buying these earphones because of some of the negative reviews
I took a risk because I have Sennheiser Headphones and found them to be the most well rounded Headphones I ever heard
Enter this product, which I purchased over 3 months ago, and you have yet another amazing Sennheiser product
The bass is crisp, responsive, and powerful
The His, Mids, and Lows are all balanced in this bargain set of earphones so I would recommend this for any genre of music
For me, this is the gold standard for any set of earphones under $40
I don't care about the sound quality of these buds, which are great
The reason I bought it was for the K-shaped wire, which is incredibly handy to have on my morning commute in NYC
being able to drape the wires around the back of my neck means i'm not constantly trying to tuck them behind my ear, or in a button, or in a pocket when I want to take them out temporarily to hear something or speak to someone
I'll probably by 3 more just to stock up since these are so hard to find now
Way better than BEATS
This and the JVC xx buds perform equal if not better compared to DRE's buds
Quality not hype
These have the design where the cord is very short on the left ear
I have only seen this on mobile phone headsets and have no idea why Sennheiser would do that on a set of headphone without a microphone
It puts the cord pressure all on one ear and makes them very uncomfortable to wear
I assume it will also cause the left ear to short-out over time as other reviewers have noted
The cord is also very noisy and the sound quality isn't anything special IMO
I'll be honest, these are not the best sounding earbuds I've ever used
But they're probably one of the best sounding $35 earbuds I've ever used
They don't have as much bass as I prefer, but I can deal with that
I was looking specifically for a pair of earbuds with asymmetrical cords that wouldn't get in my way and annoy me while at the computer
I was amazed at the bass level from such a small device
They are comfortable and create a nice listening environment
the very bust buds for under $100 got mine for 35ish
frequency response is very nice
bass present but not overkill
get these for metal and the s4's for rap/pop
These earpbuds preform well enough for their price, I got them cheap ($20+) during the black friday sales
When I received them, I was totally disappointed, they performed worse than a standard apple earbuds
After reading some reviews online about requiring to break in I decided to run metal/hardcore music at 70% max volume for 24 hours to break in, the sound after that was a lot better
Having said that, I ordered these with a pair of SoundMAGIC E10 for my girlfriend, and for that price, I would go for the SoundMAGIC, it's like comparing Justin Beiber (Sennheiser) to Ed Sheeran (SoundMAGIC)
I used to have the previous version, and these in my opinion sound much, much better
and the passive sound isolation is so good that I don't really feel the need to buy Noise Cancelling Headphones (Sure,  I don't use them on airplanes)
Great bass too
The ones I received are genuine
As before, to be safe I made sure to buy directly from Amazon  and not from other vendors
Great buy
Better than Apple by a mile
I hav't tried more expensive buds to compare except $100 Bose buds from Costco
These are better for sound range
Good sound quality for the price
Cord can get annoying when running and using the headphones though
Good sound isolation
I'm afraid I Have almost nothing good to say about this product
Almost as soon as I received them,one earphone immediately stopped working altogether,for no apparent reason
I am certain that I did absolutely nothing to damage them
These earbuds,were also a little bit more exspensive then some of the other ones I've ordered,so for the things to half totally stop working almost as soon as I got them,is just intolerable
maybe,it was just a fluke,and this particular pair was totally flawed for some strange reason,but either way,I don't think I will ever order another thing from sennheiser again,if I can help it
Because of my experience with these,I wouldn't recommend them to anybody
Headphone jack broke within a few months, can't return it
This occurred after light use
The headphone jack seems to have a loose/broken connection, now cuts in/out frequently
I was looking for replacement headphones after my Apple Earpods stopped working and a pair of Beats Tour that that broke
I was looking for two things:1) Good quality bass2) Comfortably while being wornFirst thing, I am NOT an audiophile
I just like being able to enjoy my music that's balanced and not just too much bass, too much mid or too high
To begin, the packaging is very simple to open
Once opened you will see the earbuds "stuck" in the plastic
After you have removed them you will have to further unbox the package and you will find a small bag for the earbuds and two more sets of difference sized buds
The first thing I noticed that wasn't in the description is that the right earbud wire is longer than the left one so one can wrap it around the back of the neck
This wasn't an issue for me but it would have been nice to know
When I started using them, I was pleased with the bass response that I got from the earbuds
It is well distributed for my taste
The bass also feels a bit stronger since the earbuds go into your ear canal and the vibration gives it a stronger feel
Overall I'm very satisfied with this product
I love Sennheiser products, second one I own
I will be updating for a couple of months of usage
I can see these lasting a long time, and the warranty that comes with Sennheiser products only makes this better
The little bag it comes with is great, as it lets you carry them in your pocket without having to worry about it getting tangled up
great stuff, my kids love the sound of these little suckers
i love the price
cant go wrong with that
Great deep bass and easy comfortable fit
Didn't make my ears sore like other brands but after excessive use at the gym sometimes I get ear fatigue but not severe like before
The right headphone cable is longer than the left which I didn't like at first but if you swing it behind your neck and over it keeps it from swinging wildly while you run
That became a great feature I didn't know id like
Comes with carrying pouch too
Highly recommended
I think they're better than beats at a large fraction of the cost too
Always loved sennheiser products for about 5 years now since day one
You won't be disappointed if you're a huge music buff like me or even an occasional listener
I got these for 29
99 when they were originally marked at 79
99 and I couldn't be more pleased
Sadly I left them on the other side of the country when I went to visit family and I'm anxiously awaiting their return to me
These sound great and isolate noise perfectly, though they tend to fall out easily
Luckily I use them while stationary so this isn't a problem for me
These headphones completely transformed my commute
No more train noise, no more irritating conversations from the people around me, no more insanely loud volume just so I can hear my music
They're comfortable, durable, and they sound great, even in high noise environments
If you're still using the headphones that came with your iPhone/iPod, you don't know what you're missing out on
I have gone through many headphone, both in ear and covered
These are by far the most satisfying headphones in terms of sound quality, utility and overall ease of use
the relation between quality and price here is just
incredible
After four years of abuse, my CX 300 earbuds (the version before the CX 300 II) began to fail in one ear - clearly a cracked wire near the plug since jiggling at that point caused intermittent signal loss
I foolishly thought I'd "upgrade" to some Etymotics that cost over twice as much as the Sennheisers
They sounded awful - ridiculous low-end roll-off and harsh highs and mids
They were sent back the same day
Since the CX 300s were still being offered in the new "II" model, I decided they were worth another try
After receiving them and listening to some of my most challenging music (for earbuds to reproduce), I am firmly in the Sennheiser camp
The CX 300 IIs are quite smooth across the whole audio spectrum with a slight boost clearly present below about 200Hz
The increased bass response, thankfully, is not heavy-handed - probably about 2-3dB
At lower volume levels, this sounds very natural - the sort of flat response I'd expect from my very excellent Sony MDRV6 over-ear headphones
At higher volumes, the additional low frequency content is a little more noticeable, though not unpleasant
The soft tips (three sizes included) provide a pretty good seal for reasonable isolation
I'd estimate you get roughly 20 dB of external noise reduction
One trick I learned from using my prior CX 300s also works well with the new model since the earbuds themselves seem to be identical in shape and the cord enters the buds at the same location and angle
inserting the earbuds into the ear canal then rotating them so that the cords are exiting the ear UPWARDS (opposite of what you would normally do) allows the ear buds to sit in a more natural, fully sealed position in the ear since the cords are not pushing against the outer ear trying to pry the earbuds out
This gives better isolation and further enhances the low and low-mid frequencies
Like every other set of in-ear phones I've used, cord noise is audible transmitted
As the cord rattles around on a bike ride, jog, or walk, you will hear some "clunking" between songs or if you are listening at low volume levels
This is just physics
Not sure how it could be eliminated with this type of earbud
Considering the price and faithful audio performance, these are a no-brainer
Have been using this model for over 5 years now
Am convinced these are the best mid-market ear-buds out there
I'm a heavy user, and have been using these both with my laptop and when exercising, with smth like 5-10 hrs/day average usage
With such a level of usage, it's important how well the headphones are built and how reliable they are
Tried iBeats - those lasted a couple months
Recently tried MEElectronics Sport-Fi M6 - those died after a week coz apparently they can't handle sweat getting on them
I recently bought my third pair of CX300II - previous two died after between year and two of usage
Apart from reliability, am completely satisfied with sound quality and comfort
The thing I liked about the headphones was that it really does block out outside noise
However, when I listened to it, the sound was a bit static-like
I'm not sure if that was supposed to be like that or not but it just wasn't for me
Perhaps it is a good fit for others
Sound quality is ok, treble is a bit too sharp
Design of the wire cable can be better, tangle up easily
An update on the review:After about 1 and half months' "run-in" of the earphone, the sound quality becomes finer, bass and treble become more smooth
Now I can give it a 3
5 to 4 stars rating
I enjoy my CX 215's better
but my wife preferred these over her CX 215's, so there you go
To Sennheiser's credit (which no one seems to disclose -- likely because they're simply unaware of their condition), I have slight hearing loss in my mid-low tones, so earphones/equalizers that will allow me to compensate by filling in the surrounding frequencies that I -can- hear better, as well as upping those that I'm slightly deaf on, is my ideal setup
The CX 215's allow me to do that better than these
however, my wife, who does not suffer hearing loss at all, again, prefers these
In either case, a good deal from a great company
I picked these up never hearing of the company a couple of years ago after my $300 bose noise canceling on ears were worn out
These are so dope, I just bought another pair to replace the ones my cat chewed through
the no tangle wires, noise reduction (which, at a decent level, I sat on a 10 hour flight with a guy playing the bongos next to me and never heard them till I had to turn it off for landing), and it never costs more than $50
I have used top of the line bose, sony and Panasonics, I have tried beats and skull candy, and pond for pound, sennheiser is the best
The sound isn't as crisp as the >$300 headphones, but again, all things considered these are great
they will slip out if you move about a lot, so not ideal for active wear, but for long flights or at school or something, you cant beat it
These earbuds sound great with my iPod, and you can't beat the price
You have to make sure the buds are properly seated in your ear for maximum sound
Better than Apple by a mile
I hav't tried more expensive buds to compare except $100 Bose buds from Costco
These are better for sound range
Good sound quality for the price
Cord can get annoying when running and using the headphones though
Good sound isolation
Despite the possibly misleading and terribly cliche headline, these are the best headphones I have ever had, literally
I know that word gets over use, but I am literally being serious when I say these are literally the best headphones I've ever had
They play, fantastically, everything from electronic pop, to garage punk, to folk, to hip-hop
After many failed headphones and many days and nights of shed tears, putting these into my ears and pressing play was an unexpected ecstasy running through my defeated ear drums
If ears could organism it would feel like having these play in your ears
This is not the wine speaking, I've only have two glasses, but I am now crying tears of pure joy over being able to listen to music crisply for the first time
I can only image this is how formally deaf individuals feel when they regain their hearing
Buy these headphones
That is all
Best $25 dollars I've ever spent on headphones
They even went through the wash and still work
Highly suggested item
I like to listen to some bass every now and then
And thats when I use these earphones
The bass is a little too prominent
Definitely not for the audiophiles
Bass lovers will like it
At times, it feels a little boomy, I must admit
It is very goodSasukeBlaze01 approves :DI do not have any complains with this mystical device awesome bass and sounds clean
These seem to be holding up really well and they sound great
The enhanced base is a really nice feature
These are awesome headphones
I was looking through amazon for a few Hr vI  I was looking for it the Best Buy and when I seen the reviews for these I decided I'd try them
They are great and the low price makes them even better
Quality sound I really enjoy these headphones over my bose,soul,beats, and yarbuds
They don't compare
I love the fact it's like two speakers in one and that's what makes it so great
These headphones are fantastic when they work, but unfortunately the right earbud has fried out a little
It is playing a noticeable lower volume than the left one and I have had them not even two months ago
Unfortunate because they sound great
I am going to contact the company and see if they will replace them
I'll update if they do or not, currently it is pending
I ride a sport bike and have gone through many different sets (cheap, expensive and custom made)
These are the best set I have owned
Objective: they are small and fit well under full face helmetSubjective: stay on my ears, seal great, SUPER BASS, sound great and not super expensiveLittle flaw: I consider the cable a little too thin for my like, but won't change the performance or rating for that
I bought this earphones in September 2013
But it stop working now
There is no sound at all
It looks the quality of the plug jack  part is very bad and the inside  line connecting jack are broken
I am wondering if I can get a replace from Amazon
- Luke
I've tried earphones in a similar price bracket to this one, and they are much better
This one is just ok, but the sounds quality isn't that good
I recommend earphones from KLIPSCHE
I'd be mad if I paid retail for these
I just had a hearing test and I hear fine and mostly flat
I can get a decent sound with my Cowons 5 band parametric eq but can't with my Ipod classic
I get the best seal with comply tips
They don't play the lowest bass that good or 15k+ highs; they're a little louder at the 100-500hz range (like peak at 200 hertz and downward slope all the way to 15k although they claim higher)
I haven't heard a single driver IEM that can beat the Old School Silver & Black ( Ultimate Ears MetroFi 200 Noise Isolating Earphones ) with comply tips for deep bass
They don't play the highs as good as an Armature but I haven't heard Single Armatures play both the Lowest & Highest Freqs equally
Almost every player has treble boost to compensate if needed;  I hate Logitech who owns UE because of their warranty practices (Wouldn't replace a not working pair of headphones I purchased from Amazon because I didn't have a "Receipt"
The Emailed Screen Shot Showing The Purchase/Paid/Order#/Shipped Date etc
Wouldn't Due
)  But bang for buck they are nicer than most
The only complaint I have is that the bud leads are of unequal length
Good product
Also has amazing bass
Pros:Sound quality is decentEar plugs are comfortable (they come in 3 sizes)Cons:Build quality is rather flimsy
I don't expect them to last more than 8 months of everyday use
May get damaged sooner if not handled well
Absolutely cannot wear it to the gym, will tear away
Lots of static noise
Used it for face time and wasn't happy with the amplified noise
I'm not returning them as they aren't so expensive and do the job
Wouldn't recommend though
These have astoundingly good sound quality, and I wouldn't purchase any other headphones after these
I vow to buy these until they stop selling them: I love these to death
Amazing quality, extremely durable, and it looks fantastic
I have bought 3 pairs for myself/ others in the last month, and will continue to do so
Couldn't be happier with my purchase, everyone needs one of these
These are a must have, and my best purchase this year
I purchased these earbuds because I needed a sturdy pair for the gym
Quality wise this product is just ok
The cord seems to really get in the way and the sound quality is not very good
I need to invest a bit more money for a better quality product
Was confused at first at the design of the headphones because one side is longer than the other, but it's actually a pretty neat design that makes it all just go on one side of your head (you loop the right earbud around the back of your neck)
The sound quality is very nice, and even after wearing them /a lot/ (even to sleep almost every night), they're still working perfectly and show no signs of breaking or anything
I have to say that the Sennheiser CX 300 II ear buds have met or exceeded my expectations
The acid test was using them during my commute on busy city streets and buses
I've been using the iPhone 5 ear buds, and by comparison, the Sennheiser ear buds fit better in my ear and the quality and loudness of the sound is better, which is why they work well during my commute
They fit completely and comfortably in my ear without even the need to try on the other two sizes that were included
The line for the right ear is longer, which I like in an ear bud, because it makes it less likely to fall out of the ear when walking or turning the head
The Sennheiser ear buds do not have the microphone capability that is included with the iPhone 5 ear buds, but I don’t need that for listening to music, podcasts or movies, which is why I selected a pair without the added feature (and cost) of a microphone
I also like that the plug itself is at a right angle, because it doesn't stick out so far once plugged into my laptop or iPhone, making it more compact and less likely that it will be a vulnerable stress point
The pouch is compact and opens easily in one hand with a pinch so that the ear buds can be easily and quickly stored without fumbling around with zippered cases that often require two hands
All in all, I highly recommend these ear buds, especially at the price
Truly a great value

OK
My order of these earbuds had a manufacturing error - the cord of the right ear was WAY smaller than the cord for the left ear; and I couldn't adjust the length
So, that was a failure
Second, the earbuds do not fit in the ear very snug
It comes with several different sizes but it doesn't matter
They didn't fit and I'd be forced to only use them when I was completely idle
Otherwise, if I was at the gym or even just walking casually, they would quickly just fall out
Third, the enhanced bass was not noticeable
The apple earbuds that come with an iPhone/iPod are better sounding and the bass is much more salient
So, perhaps my particular order was just a dud
Or, maybe all of the Sennheiser CX 300 II earbuds are like this
I can't say for sure
I just know that without a doubt, these were bad
I threw them away one week after I got them
Junk
the sound is not Dr
Dre but close and especially for people like me that are hearing impaired
I am very happy with this purchase
I bought these earbuds based on a review by Cameron Madera on the panasonic earbuds I also purchased
Let me tell you the sennheisers cost approx 40 and the panasonics approx
4
Panasonic blew the Senns right out the window in fit and sound
Dont waste your money on these earbuds, there are much better products to spend hard earned money on
I had a pair of these for about a year and because of my misuse(yanked on it while it was still attached to my laptop) the wiring broke near the connection
Of course it was still under warrantly and they just sent me a completely new pair for free
Wanted an extra pair of headphones, looked around a bit and thought these fell within my price range
After an hour or so of wear I found these very uncomfortable
Haven't used them in a while after the first couple weeks because they were just too uncomfortable
Sound quality seemed average, to boot
Amazing sound
Very clear
Distortion is minimal, if at all
Can't wait to compare to my girlfriend's beats and my V Moda lp, when they come in
I think these headphones sound amazing but I'm not much of an audiophile like some of the professionals in the reviews
I was hesitant about earbuds because others I've used irritate me after a while
I mostly use these at a desk with a laptop, no jogging
I like the asymmetrical cord design and I feel these headphones were well worth the price
Can't adjust the length of the ear phones
One side is way too long
Maybe there is a way but no instructions for the adjustment
I like these; however, when it comes to earbuds to wear for work (I work as a medical transcriptionist and wear headphones 30-40 hours a week), these are not my top choice
I did not realize that the wires are two different lengths, which annoys me to no end
I realize this is supposed to reduce tangling, but I have not noticed that it does
It just feels lopsided
I also have a strange hum when using these with my laptop, which is unique to these earbuds and does not happen when using other brands
I also have a problem keeping these in my ears as opposed to my Etymotic Research (with those, I use the squishy buds and not the flange)
The sound is okay, but not the best I've heard
They are decent for the price, but if you spend just a little bit more, you can have much better earbuds than this
Still, if you're used to cheap Skullcandy type ear buds, these will blow you away
I am used to pro phones though so I would say these are middle of the road, sound-wise
The sound quality of the headphones is gorgeous, from what I'm used to ($30 Sony headphones, better than stock Apple headphones, but not audiophile- level)
I am relatively new to the audiophile- segment
However, I'm listening to these through Audioquest's Dragonfly DAC
The high's are crisp and clear without being harsh
The mid's and low's are warm without being overbearing
There's just enough punch and ambiance to the bass to accentuate
I'd have to say that I agree with the general consensus with regards to other (audiophile reviews, not customer) reviews
For the price (on Amazon
com), I have not experienced music with this level of quality
I'm very satisfied with the product - I give it a 4
9, since I don't give out 5's
The seller was fast with processing the order and shipping it out - the package arrived before the said arrival date
I have absolutely no complaints
I did not communicate with customer service, directly, as there was no need
I'd actually give the seller a 4
99 (my best compliments)
Overall, this has been my best experience with Amazon
com

For superb (yet low-cost) in-ear headphones, the CX300s have always been my go-to
They are comfortable to stick in my ears and the quality sound and build is awesome in the overall aspect
Maybe i'm just used to them, but I I don't notice any one part of the sound spectrum overpowering the rest--perhaps the base is a little on the heavy side, but it's an enjoyable amount and not overbearing, uncomfortable, or causing muddiness (the EQ isn't biased towards a certain genre like Klipsch or Beats may be--not trying to bash on them)
It's just enough that when I crank the volume up a notch, I can get very good bumping feel on rock, hip hop, techno/rave/club styles
At the same time, the quality for classicals and accoustic tracks is just amazing
I have played the piano for 9 years and I am obsessed with hearing live quality sounds when it comes to piano tracks
Speaking of live, I enjoy listening to live sessions on these in-ears because the quality is great
The reverbs on the vocals come out really well AND the crispness of a piano or accoustic guitar is uncompromised
At least to my ears
I have always invested in the CX300 II's until the price shot up to $60
or were they always there
Could've sworn there was a time the prices were lower
maybe around $40 or $50
Then I would find them on sale for roughly half off
At the same time, they last me so long that I guess it pays off unless I run around the basketball court with them at which point they get caught and pulled around very hard
sometimes even stepped on
These days, i'm experimenting with on-ears but even the expensive ones are nothing compared to these babies
Or maybe it's always been like that, on-ears vs in-ears
ANYWAYS
I certainly recommend these headphones for their quality sound and build
However, do try to find them on sale rather than coughing up the $60 unless you're made of money or don't care
Also, someone in a review mentioned buying from an Authorized Dealer--I totally agree
When it comes to headphones that are $60 or higher, find an authorized dealer
perhaps even buy direct if you're paranoid about where it's coming from and who might be tinkering with it
For quality headphones that lasts me a while, I wouldn't mind buying direct
as long as it's on sale HAH
I have owned a number of earbuds before
These are competitive with buds 2-3x their price
First, the sound
Clear, not too "bassy"
The buds themselves do a very good job at canceling out outside noise
But I should clarify, they aren't actively canceling, just passively
Next, the cord is nice, but I certainly wish it had some kevlar coating that other manufacturers are using to help with the tangling
However, the carrying case these buds come with is SPOT ON
I have never bothered with a carrying case before, because they are usually too tedious to open/close
I know this sounds weird, but it was a nice touch
The cord itself has an offset length
The left earbud has a shorter cable to the 'Y' in the cord than the right earbud
it just feels weird at times because the right earbud now drapes around my head or under my chin
This leaves the earbuds hanging from my chin, tugging more at my left ear and less on my right
So it has a slightly off-balance feel
I haven't exercised with these yet, but I can update when I've had the chance to make sure these won't fall out while running, for instance
Lastly, no mic; so if you want a mic, these aren't gonna help
Aside from that, for the price and sound quality, I'd say these are great; especially when at work and you want to jam out without having a couple cans on your head :)
I was in the market for nice earbuds when my old Sony's stopped working after 10 years
The Bose IE2 came highly recommended, but I did not want to spend $100
So I tried these, and I returned them immediately
These did not fit my (small) ear, even with the small sized rubber pieces
The cord length is also uneven
Instead of splitting in the middle, this splits 75%/25%, so the smaller earbud was constantly falling out of my ear because of the extra weight on that side
There is no description anywhere that the cord lengths are uneven, but this was the deal-breaker for me
I can't imagine that these would work for every day use, especially if you are going to use for running or working out
I swapped these out for the Panasonic HJE12 at $8/pair, and can sincerely say that they are a better product
Do not waste your money on these Sennheiser
Will never buy this brand again
I needed a pair of headphones that I could take to the gym
These are great for staying in your ears compared to the apple headphones
So if you plan on doing something active that involves running or biking these are great
As far as the sound I was a little disapointed
The sound isn't crisp and I prefer the sound of apples headphone over these
These headphones focus on the mids
The lows and highs are missing
These do have great sound isolation if you are in loud environments
If you want something with bass these aren't for you
Sound is always a users preference
Gives these a try and see if you like them
I've owned these sennheisers now for about 6 months and I love them
The sound quality surpasses those of earbuds twice or even three times its price
No frequency overpowers another, they are all very well balanced
Everything from rock  and electronic to rap and jazz sounds great
The unique design for the cord allows you to wrap the right ear bud around the back of your neck so you don't have to deal with the cord in front of you all the time which is very convenient
However, my only issue with the design is that since the cord is made of a rubber, it does not allow for much slipping
This creates a lot of friction when you're moving around a lot and can cause the right ear bud to tend to want to `pop` out of our ear sometimes
This is especially annoying when you're exercising or doing any sort of activity that involves twisting your neck frequently
I unfortunately ended up damaging my earbuds today because of this while working out
Despite the questionable nature of the unequal cord lengths these are extremely good headphones that I would recommend to anyone looking for good sound quality on a budget
I still believe that these headphones rightfully deserve a 5 star rating
What they lack in durability and perhaps practicality, they make up for in sound quality
These headphones are AWESOME
Excellent sound
Wow
Comes with 3 different sizes of headphone rubber pads so you can adjust them to your ear size
The second I plugged these headphones into my MP3 player (which is a Sony) I was blown away
The bass is excellent and loud & clear
This brand is MUCH BETTER than Sony or any other brand I've tried
My MP3 player came with Sony headphones that broke within a few months & I just bought covers for my other Sony headphones that I'm only going to use as a backup
I think I'm going to stick with Sennheiser for now on
I'M VERY IMPRESSED
These are great headphones, I was a little concerned since they were so cheap compared to other pairs that I was looking at but these do not disappoint me
PROS:-Clear, distinct sound, especially towards the mid and low range
I am hearing things in these headphones that I couldn't previously hear in my old cheap pair that I got with my phone
-Noise cancellation: If you put this in with no music playing you can obviously hear things around you, just not so distinct
But if your listening to music you are immersed in it and it's helpful if your a college student like me who wants to drown out all the background noise while studying or working
CONS:-High ends may drown out just a bit
Because these are Enhanced Bass earbuds you obviously will noticed more of the mid and low range in these headphones
So the high ends may be a little to quiet but that's just my opinion
It does not effect my 5 star rating though by any means
Overall, these are awesome for their price
I've only had them for about a week and I think they are awesome
These earbuds don't like to stay in my ear
They keep slipping out
These also have one of the cables (that go to your ears) longer than the other
That makes then feel weird to wear
I wish they'd just make both the left and right cables the same length
I bought these because they were so highly rated, but I made a mistake
I bought them for working out, which they are not very good for because they pop out of your ears like every 5 seconds
I ordered these hoping I'd get a decent pair of earbuds to use while I'm at the gym; unfortunately these are a tremendous disappointment
The most important thing when considering the quality of a pair of headphones is, of course, the sound
Despite the advertised 'enhanced bass' the sound is gutless and tinny: really not that much better than what you'd get from one of the $5-$10 pairs of earbuds off Amazon
The treble/highs are pretty poor as well and there is some distortion/rattle if you are listening to music that is bass heavy
Granted, these are only ~$30, but my Apple earpods that these replaced easily sounded better (and they came with a mic and volume control on the cord)
The second big problem with these (as other reviewers have pointed out) is the bizarre cord situation
Having one ear longer than the other obviously can cause some problems, especially when you're exercising
I will give Sennheiser props for making the jack very durable, it seems like these headphones are less susceptible to 'cord death' from  the cord flexing near the jack
As much as I wanted to like these, they ended up being a let down
maybe I just got a bad pair
Sennheiser makes some excellent products, unfortunately this really isn't one of them
Pretty good quality
One headphones wire is longer which could be an inconvenience
Also if you're moving around too much you hear some crackling
You're better off buying Apple EarPods for better quality and price
I've experienced both
Great headphones for cheap
Left ear had connectivity problems after only 5 months
I think it should last longer than 5 months
Title pretty much says it
They sounded fine while they lasted, but they didn't last
To be fair, I'm pretty hard on headphones, but this was the shortest amount of time any headphones have ever lasted for me
The Sennheiser earbuds fits so snug and comfortably
The sound is clear and rich
I am not a careful guy
I keep them in my pocket and it is still functioning well
I got these on sale for $30
00, and I'm extremely happy
The bass really kicks, and the overall sound seems balanced
I'm not too picky when it comes to earbuds, but I've bought enough pairs to know that these are a great deal
I love these earbuds so much
Of course with things there are pros and cons, but with this product the pros overwhelm the cons
The cons are that the cord is longer for the right earbud, obviously for behind the neck use
This doesn't get in the way much (well for people like me with short hair) but if you're OCD, then this will give you one heck of a time
Also, these aren't for athletic use obviously, so the buds will eventually fall out of your ears if you are running or pounding the pavement somehow
The pros for this product are much better: The sound quality is outstanding
The bass stereo blends perfectly with the treble, deep, and moist sounds
They won't fall out if you stay still and pound your feet as if you were running
The noise cancelling is outstanding as well, I can't hear the person sitting next to me, even if they're shouting my name
The buds stay in my ears without me having to push them in constantly
Finally, these can put up a great argument against the brand "Beats
" I've never liked Beats and this gives me another great reason
These earbuds are inexpensive and fulfill the cost that I paid for them
I never have recommended Beats to anybody because they can't provide good enough sound for extreme music listeners like me
I had discovered Sennheiser a couple years ago, and I can't get over how amazing the quality of their products are
If you're considering buying Beats I would completely not recommend blowing your cash on headphones that yes, look nice and modern, but can't provide sound quality
I would recommend these earbuds, not only for their sound quality, but also for their style and portability
After using cheapo headphones and earbuds for years, I finally decided to try a quality brand
I started with Sennheiser, which seemed to have the most reasonable price
I am delighted with the wonderful sound I'm getting with these earbuds, and I love the asymmetrical cord design
One side is longer and goes behind the neck, which makes the cord hang straight to one side, instead of bunching up under my chin
The packaging is horrible
I found it almost impossible to open the blister pack, and I wounded myself in the process
If not for the diabolical packaging, I would give these earbuds a 5-star rating
Great quality, don't waste your money on s*** like Beats By Dre
Only gripe is that I cannot use these while working out as they tend to slip out
-Sound Quality - Exaggerated on the low end but acceptable for a product in this price range and category
-Durability - I've had these for about 3 months now and they've survived a few trips per week to the gym as well as falling asleep with them in most nights
No issues yet
-Fit/Comfort/Design -This is where the cx300's lose major points in my book
I'm content with the earbud itself it's compact and the rubber tips create a good seal in my ear canal
The asymmetrical cord is one of the most irritating "features" of these 'buds, at the gym I run the cord through my shirt and the cord split always catches on my collar and pulls on the shorter left cord that is bearing all the weight
The longer right cord has too much slack and hits me in the face or catches on things
The cable material is ridiculously prone to tangling
If you wad up your ear bud's into your hand and then open it again it will take a full minute to get the knots out
If this comes in and out of your pocket, Lord help you
Finally I don't care for the right angle plug but this is a forgivable design decision
My phone is the primary driver of these 'buds and the headphone jack is on the top of the phone making it awkward to leave my phone plugged in in my pocket
If using a laptop or phone with a side mounted headphone jack you might prefer this
I owned two pairs of Jbud J3's before buying these
The jack is straight, the cord tangles way less, and the cord is symmetrical, and the sound is nearly as good
The first pair lasted a couple years, the next pair lasted about a week so durability is a toss up
Sound quality is high and the in ear design is comfortable, however there a number of things about this product which have disappointed me
1) Rubberized cable transfers a lot of noise to the ear - you cannot use these earbuds unless you are sitting perfectly still
2) Silicone ear piece comes off easily
I've had one pop off while on an airplane - it was gone forever
3) Product is extremely fragile
I had a pair specifically reserved for office use which has under the course of a year required me rebuild the plug (epoxy cast) and re-solder the left ear cable (due to a loose wire)
Note: The solder job was not easy as the headphones use acrylic coated ultra thin wires
It was my third casualty
4) The earbud leads are uneven in length
This may not bother some people, but it was a constant nuisance to me
5) The warranty is not worth the paper it's on
I saved all of my documentation including UPC and original receipt and was unable to get the company to make good on replacing the item - due to 'wear and tear' not being covered
If I can't count on a set of earbuds lasting me longer than a year - I certainly won't be paying any more than 15 bucks for them
Pros: Sennheiser makes comfortable products with good sound range
Cons: See above
I won't be purchasing another set
Great headphones, bought it for my sister for Christmas and she loves them
Told her the price and she said it felt like $100 headphones
I got a pair of these headphones a few months ago and they still provide a fantastic range of sound
Aside from the quality of the sound these earbuds deliver, they seem to fit my ears superbly and that makes a huge difference for me when it comes to headphones
The highs are crisp
The mids sound great
The lows aren't shake your skull with vibrations good, but the CX 300's provide a clean low with no distortion and a little kick in the ear
I've played with equalizers and bass heavy music and you can reach a deep low that the headphones manage really well
The length of the left ear cord is half the length of the right ear cord
This is to wrap the right ear cord around the back of your neck and keep the whole cord running down only one side of your body
I personally like this feature, but it's worth mentioning if you don't want that difference and would prefer equal length cords
These headphones come with a small carrying case that I use daily
It's a nice touch to throw in with the purchase
I think it helps prevent my headphones from becoming too tangled in my pocket
Bottom line: I use these headphones daily and they sound fantastic
I checked the reviews, and these came up as the best bang for the buck
They do not disappoint
I don't consider myself an audiophile, but I can tell the difference between MP3s and CDs, so I wanted some earbuds that were decent
These are those
everything about them are great
great sound
comfy
light weight so it doesnt pull down on your ears
only small problem i found at first
but now not so much
the right ear cord goes on the back on your neck
I like the sound quality, I like the fit
But I'm 42 and this thing creates too much bass and after listening to music for 30 minutes my ear drums hurt
Not pleasant
I stopped using them
I didn't have that problem with my $99 Bose earphones that broke that I was replacing
I was really on the fence about what earbuds to buy or how much to spend
I'm a casual audiophile for home audio, but typically I don't get into all the mp3 player stuff-- I prefer a big soundstage
Well, these are changing my mind about quality and how easy it is to achieve a standard of quality without spending too much money
They're incredible, clear, and I would even insist they have great noise isolation
I can't think of a negative about these-- even the wrap-around concept doesn't annoy me as it did other reviewers
It's kind of nice to not have the cord dangling in front of you, but yet around the back of your neck
They're built so well, feel nicely weighted and have that rich dark sound Sennheiser is known for producing
Just buy them, they're cheap and the quality is worth three times the price
You cannot compare this to antoher earbuds, Sennheiser sound transportation gets you to every detailed sound that an opera can play
Quick Ship
Great sound, well packed, sturdy connections, quality components, should last for quite a while
These are the second pair I now own
I am a headphone aficionado, and will admit that I will be happy to give my opinion when needed
This is one of those times, but instead of reviewing the product, I want to know from anyone what headphones get this loud (113 db) and this clear (crystal clear) for this price
I'd like to hear from someone who'd like to offer their advice
Spending big money on headphones is for some
For me, I'd rather spend under $70 and should be rather content
And indeed I have been
If these headphones had more thumpin' bass, I am quite sure my head would explode
Sometimes you want to immerse yourself in deafening music, and I would be the first one to say almost all headphones can be louder and clearer
These do not fall into either category
These are simply of another level
Crystal clear at low volumes
heavenly at high volumes
Best bang for the buck and I would like to hear feedback of what could be better taking into account the price, crystal clear vocals, perfect amount of bass (no ear fatigue) and louder than life volumes that are also crystal clear (no muddiness, or cracking)
Glad I had a chance to give my opinion on these phones :)
It is really a value for money, this is the second one I buy, because the first one suddenly after 3 about months, I found that the left side phone volume was decreased to about 70% with no clear cause
No corruption on the wires nor the bindings
Very bright and sharp sound reproduction , not particularly heavy in bass at all , just clear mids and powerful highs
I have had owned 3 of these headphones and after one got destroyed, one was stolen and the other one was lost, I decided to go for it and buy another one
These are earbuds for an audiophile
For someone who feels the mid and low lines
Doesn't distort the sound in any way, and feels really good in your ears
The only bad thing, which is completely understandable due to weight issues, is the quality of cable
If you pull the cable, there's a chance that it won't work in one of the ears
Also, has really good filtering if you are not listening to really high sounds like Dubstep, or similar genres
Highly recommended
comfortable, low profile, affordable, noise cancelling and great for use w motor cycle helmet or on the plane
My wife keeps stealing mine
I received these earbuds and the left bud had about 6 inches of wire to the Y and the right bud had about 18 inches to the Y
Guess that's why they were less expensive(still $40 is alot to pay for a defective product)
The sound quality is fine but the experience of getting a product like this will make me much more wary the next time I buy a product on Amazon
I have been informed that the uneven length is by design
As a result I have changed my rating from a 1 to a 3 as the sound quality is nice
There are much less expensive alternatives that are available if you want something for the gym or for working out when sound quality is not that big of a deal
The sound is good
I'm playing in the band at church, and these sound better than a pair of Skullcandy earbuds
However, I probably wasn't paying attention, and didn't notice that these are an asymmetrical design
Now, I'm not sure if this is good or not
It seems this makes them more difficult to fall out, which is a good thing
However, one cord always sticks out instead of going straight down in the back, which is not visually appealing for being up front
One side is longer and maybe that's the way you're "supposed" to wear them but it was awkward
Sound is great tho if you don't mind the cord
I tried to get these to work for me but they just didn't work out
The fit is odd, I tried all the sizes and still couldn't get the good fit that my regular iPhone headphones have
This headphone should have cost 100-200$
For 30$ its awesome
I would recommend this to everyone
Case is good too
First off, I typically love Sennheiser headphones and use the over the ear ones when I record music
These headphones sound very bass heavy, and the sound is very intense
Call me crazy, but I prefer headphones with a very neutral frequency response because that's how the engineer wants you to hear it
The second thing that I find kind of obnoxious about these headphones is the way the cord is shorter for the left side and super long for the right
What this means is when You turn your head to the right, the left side will pop out of your ear 30% of the time
Fine, I'll only look left then
I wore/wear these when I go to the gym, and after about two months of 3 or 4 hours of use per week I noticed the sound starting to cut out
At first I thought my iPod was toast, then I realized that the thick connector that was supposedly really robust only worked if I kept it at a very particular angle in my pocket
Ok, so now it looks like I'm scratching my nether region when I'm trying to get the sound to come back and not just hear the bass register, which really gets you lots of friends at a gym
I don't recommend trying to find this "sweet spot" when some giant's girlfriend is doing squats
So in short, they are decent headphones with some less than desirable features and is primarily targeted for people who don't turn their heads very often or use them on a regular basis
I'm disappointed
I really like the entire Sennheiser line
These earbuds fully met my expectations
I even bought a second pair for my son- who also loved the sound and feel
If you don't need the big name/big price brands and you want something that will last much longer than the Skull products- then give Sennheiser a solid test
The good:nice quality soundgood lookslong cordThe bad:different length sides took a while to get used toOverall: good in-ear headphones
The only reason I returned these was because it was supposed to be bass boosted, but they had as much bass as the cheap $7 earphones at walmart
Other than that it was very high quality but it didn't meet my needs
These buds provided great sound and did block out noise, but they stopped connecting to my phone after a few weeks
Too bad
Worst design in the world
The cord for each bud are different lengths and makes these so awkward I've never used them
Do not buy them
Complete waste of money
Must resell on eBay
Liked sound, comfort of ear buds
Did not like wrap around cords especially when working out
Case was fine comes in handy
Sound great
I use them all the time
The fit is perfect and sound comes thru very clear
A great product
Amazing sound for the price, probably the best deal on a pair of great sounding in ear phones
Highly reccomend if desiring a more affordable pair of in ear phones
I bought these based on tons of good reviews, and I am sad to say they are OK at best
I am no audiophile by any means but I do appreciate good sound, I feel like the stock S4 headphones and apple's new earpods are better than these
I bought these as a replacement to my original iPhone 5 earbuds
I can't say if I like them more
Yes, the bass sounds much better than iPhone's earbuds
But the tremble is not a great
Plus the cables are not as flexible
These are great
so comfortable and really good quality
I had purchase some $50 jbuds, but they were really uncomfortable
These are so much better
Worth the price
Bought these for my daughter to replace the ones that came with her ipod
Fit is perfect and very comfortable
Audio is much better than with her old ones
She loves them
The Sennheiser CX 300B MK II earbuds has a great sound range, and bass boom fills out nicely
It has a long left or right lead to bring the wires to one side of your body, leaving that awkward hand/arm space free
Didn't even realize that was an issue until now
Nice sleek design in black and steel
They also fit very comfortably in the ear
Completely satisfied with my purchase
Didn't read there was no inline volume control
Sound quality just ok but what do you expect for a mere $25
sound quality is ok, not impressed
It broke after a week
not worth 30bucks for such a bad built
Boss is the way better
I purchased these to replace the cx475 pair that I had for about two years (the jack connection began to go bad)
This new pair of cx 300B sound comparable
Nice separation of treble and base, with a fairly balanced midrange
The bass is by no means overwheing, which works well for my sensibilities
My only issue is with the cord being split so the right side is longer than the left
I get that this is designed to wrap behind your neck, but is somewhat annoying
Otherwise, recommended
One star for a terrible lack of longevity
The headphones sounded fine (especially for the price) until the left ear bud died after just over one month's use
Spend the extra cash for better quality, because you'll be buying another set anyhow
Or, if you want to stay within the price range, go with something by Sony
I've spent less money on Sony products that lasted 10x as long and sounded just as good
I would definitely not recommend buying this product
One side is of the ear buds are longer than the other
Although I know it has a function I wish it had said it in the description
I do like the earbuds, the sound is great, fits very well
I'm thinking to order some more for the family
Not audiophiles, but quickly saw the difference between good headphones and the ones that come with your phone or player
Good bass tones from these and really obvious sound quality difference
These are great earphones for sure
As a heavy metal, hard rock fan i must say the bass sound is awesome
There's just one problem the wire it's kinda long and the left ear one is longer than the other
There's no remote either
Great sound nontheless
Found the mechanical quality to be above average but sonic performance is only middle of the road
I have a set of Koss KEB30K that are way better for less money
These headphones are actually really nice
The noise cancellation works very well and the sound quality is on par with other Sennheiser products
My friend had a Boss earbud set and these sound much better than his by a long shot
He paid a couple of hundred for those and even with the small amp built in, they do not hold up to these Sennheiser
The bass is great on these headphones
The mids/highs are also good and you can listen to anything from Hip hop to Jazz and not be disappointed
They're definitely worth the money but if you are a runner I don't know that I would recommend them unless you have other earbuds that will fit better
Again - I said runner - I walk around with these all the time with no issues but if you start running you MAY encounter an issue
Powerful and clear sound for the size
Comfortable fit in my ears as well
You'd think you were accessing the sound from a stereo, not your Kindle Fire
I am just an average music listener but I couldn't tell a significant difference between these and the cx200 by Sennheiser
Less than a week after I bought them I dropped my tablet and the metal jack bent and broke off, as I'm sure any headphones would
I sent sennheiser a repair request but haven't received ANY kind of reply back
The headphones came with a perfect case and 2 extra pairs of rubber ear inserts as well
Pros:-Cost-Decent soundCons:- When the wire is jolted there is some crackling and popping which is pretty painful to the ears
- Not very stable in the ear
Overall:- I would recommend going with the Klipsch IMAGE S4
They are all around better (better sound, more stable in the ear, no popping)
I would strongly discourage anyone looking for a set of headphones for running or for the gym from buying these
I really like the way they sound
The only thing keeping them from getting 5 stars is the length of the cord to each earphone
I'm not sure what they call it but one side is twice the length of the other
I have a cheap pair of ear buds I was trying to replace
The Sennheiser buds are not as good as the cheap pair
The sound from these is tinny, and distant
I want my music to be full and to surround me
I read all the reviews before purchasing, but I was extremely disappointed
My wife also tried them and agreed with me
not the quality sound that was expected
I love Sennheiser, but these earbuds were not that great
I have a pair of headphones from them that I adore, but again these are not great eaebuds
I don't mistreat my audio gear
However, these broke in exactly 2 months from the day I got them
I didn't even use them that much
I was using them to work out with, and one of the earbuds just popped during a song and stopped working
The cord was also a huge problem
I'm rather tall so it could just be me, but every minute or so one of the earbuds would pop out of my ear and I'd have to pull the cord up and put it back in
Basically, terrible workout earbuds
The sound quality isn't that great either
The base is usually clear, but good luck hearing soft notes tones
For $30ish bucks they're ok, but I'm quite disappointed with these
I expected better from Sennheiser
I've been through a lot of earbuds--use my MP3 walking, knitting and at the gym
My J-Lab earbuds were lasting an average of 4-5 months
My son gave me a pair of Klipsch and they lasted longer but the sound wasn't great
I got a pair of these ear buds on sale and loved them so bought another
The sound is better than any I've had before and so far I haven't managed to break them (it's only been 3 months)
I was not sure I would like the long and short cords, but they work find
These ear buds don't pick up noise from the wires when I'm walking or at the gym like my previous ones
very good deal for the price range and i compared it to all my other earbuds this one really make u feel a diffrence in sound quality and clarity go for it and stop searching any further unless u want to buy a dr dree one and i dont know if its any better or not
I've used these for over a month now to listen to music while commuting and while I run
Works well in both situations
I like that it came with different size rubber attachments since I always have trouble fitting earbuds and keeping them in my ears, especially while running
These don't come out while running at all, even through the sweat
I'm not an audiophile by any means, but they sure do sound a lot better than the crappy $10 earbuds from Target I used to go through every 3 months
I wish I had read that they had an asymmetrical cable because I was surprised when I received them
I don't like the asymmetrical cable, and don't use it behind my neck like it was intended for as I have long hair and the cord always gets in the way
Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase
I have never auditioned one of those $150+ a pair earbuds, because I am never going to spend that kind of money for something I wear to the gym
I have auditioned plenty of $30 pairs, and I can say that these are absolutely the best sounding buds I have found for this kind of money
The sound they produce is well balanced
Crisp, clean highs, and just enough bass
I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, but not rap
For those who do, these will not kill brain cells with each electronic drum beat
But for everyone else, you should find these ear buds pretty exceptional
I'm thinking of ordering a second pair, just in case
Very good sound and consistent
I got these and the j5, I think they were better but after a couple days they started chirping
These are one of the best pair of earbuds I own
The only downside to them that I don't like is that the left headphone wire is about half the size of the right one
The sound is perfect in them though
Disappointed with this name brand Sennheiser earbuds - NOT balanced mega bass - muffled sound - not enough mid and treble range sound
My son likes the quality of sound and was shipped timely
Overall a very good product as it has been used for over a month now and is holding up well
Not audiophiles, but quickly saw the difference between good headphones and the ones that come with your phone or player
Good bass tones from these and really obvious sound quality difference
These are great earphones for sure
As a heavy metal, hard rock fan i must say the bass sound is awesome
There's just one problem the wire it's kinda long and the left ear one is longer than the other
There's no remote either
Great sound nontheless
A great deal for the price and he says they block out external noise as well as producing a good sound for his music
While not much more expensive than any earphones I've bought in the past, these are by far the best I've used
I'm not much of an audiophile, but for the price I paid, I am extremely impressed by the fidelity of sound coming out of these things
Honestly, I've never had a pair of ear phones die on me this quickly
Even $9 ear phones last longer than this
I listen to music every day, probably a lot more than the normal user, but the left ear has up and died randomly one day
I never coil my ear phones and shove them into my pocket
They are always nicely kept, especially since I'm investing in a $40 product
It's possible I got a dud or something, but I wouldn't risk buying another pair
However, in the time that they did work, the ear phones produced good sound like other reviewers have mentioned
I would recommend it for the sound, but be careful in case you get a dud
Really ruins it, y'know
I'll keep my review concise as most other reviewers have already addressed the positives and negatives of the Sennheiser CX 300B MK II
Within less than two months of light to moderate use the cord frayed and then tore completely
Simply disappointing though not surprising as these headphones seemed to good to be true, especially in regards to the price
I recommend purchasing an actual durable headphone that won't become inoperable after a short period of time
PROS:High quality soundAesthetically pleasing (They definitely look nice)Relatively inexpensiveComfortableCONS:Terrible and feeble cord
It's been less than 90 days since I purchased these and the cord is dead for one of the buds
This is not acceptable as these are not $7 headphones
the sound quality is good however it is a bit overly bassy, and its just not as good of an overall balance
the overly rubberized cord is incredibly annoying and often gets tangled, as well as the asymmetrical cord is also fairly annoying, personally i would have rather have gotten Ultimate Ears at least those have flat non tangle cords
but i decided to give sennheiser a try because of brand recognition: Next time i'll stick with what i enjoyed the last time
Cord is weak, sound is on the high scale next to $54 Skullcandy headphones
has a nice little pouch I use for my Skullcandys
got them about a couple of months ago - I like these Senn earbuds more than a set of Senn open-air headphones I've had for a few years (costing about 10 times as much) - blows me away that you can get this kind of sound quality for $30
Excellent material and form
Lots of my friends have this earphones and they have always work awesome, regarding what other people say
Extra Bass
What extra bass
My old Skullcandy 50/50s sound 100x better
I feel ripped off by these things
Also, the one ear longer than the other
what's the deal with that
Bass is weak
Highs and mids are good to very good
The bass is almost none existent
Why all the good reviews
Decent for the price
On day two, the cord comes out of the bud
Great sound, but useless now
Even the $10 buds I've bought in the past lasted a lot longer than two days
I bought this because it had high reviews
The good news is: It was delivered to my house fast, it was brand new, and it worked when I plugged it in
The bad news is: I didn't like the sound quality
If you want to buy great earphones, I would recommend buying the Sennheiser CX200 Twist-to-Fit Earbuds
To me they are 100 times better than this
At first I was disappointed in these earphones
I first started listening and found the bass to be excellent and clear, but the higher pitched sounds were flat and distorted
After a few tries I figured out that you have to push the buds in deep in the ear canal to get the right sound
Once I did this the sound was more what I was expecting from these
I have never used earbuds before that are like earplugs, so maybe this is standard for buds
The nose cancellation is nothing more than an earplug effect, it blocks all sounds and even has that "underwater" effect that makes you hear yourself breath, chew food, and pick up other sounds that you wouldn't without earplugs
However, they do work well and sound is pretty good overall
I docked 1 star for the earplug effect, its annoying if your doing something while listening
The bass was perfect for my taste, deep enough but not to the point where it is unbalanced from the other sounds
I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good upgrade that isn't going to seriously hurt the wallet
The sound is good and what I expected and I really like that you can use different ear pieces to fit your ear
But I don't understand why there is a difference in the length of cord between each ear
I found that very frustrating
Liked these ear buds instantly, Good bass not overpowering
Good clarity overallKlipsch Image S4 may edge these buds out in stereo imaging
I often buy new earbuds because they're on sale, because I want a microphone, or because they look cool
When my new earbuds inevitably break one day out of warranty, I go back to these
Because they sound good and they're built well
I felt bad realizing that I hadn't reviewed them
"I review the terrible headphones that break, I should throw the ol' Sennheisers a bone," I thought
In summary: The best earbud-for-money swap you can make
For the money, they are a decent buy
Not enough bass though, especially since is says bass boost
The cords are really thin and I wonder if that will lead to the internal wires separating quickly like a lot of other earbuds do over time
This earbud provides good overall sound, and seals out room noise pretty good, the only thing I dislike is the overall length is too long, and the uneven length of the right and left cords
I have brought so many earphones and so far these have been the best ones Ive come across for the money
I didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars on something I listen to on beach and sking or on the boat wont be upset if i damage them when I use them in so many diffent places that arent kind to to electronics

The sound quality is wonderful, and the fit in the ear is nice, but within a short period of time, neglect on my part resulted in irreparable damage to the wiring
Rather disheartening
I do not have a single problem with these earbuds besides that magical elf that sneaks into your pocket and tangles the wire up
Now for the actual review: Amazing quality, gold plated prong (forgot the word for it, sorry), good length and just overall an amazing product
I got these on sale for $25 and I see that they go on sale quite often
I would've gladly payed the full $70 for this
The quality of these Earbuds are close, if not the same as my brothers $20 Audia Technica's
I highly recommend getting this
They are amazing great quality for certain
I was a bit concerned when I read one cord  connecting to the ear piece would be shorter then the other ear bud
but it does not change a thing very comfortable to wear
Only down side I could think of is they are a bit hard to get in the ear
but once you manage they stick like glue never have had a problem with them coming out unless I wanted them to
These headphones as very nice, they are cheap, produce great sound, and they cancel the outside noise, I love them
These earbuds offer awesome sound quality and are great for canceling background noise
The changeable ear pieces make them very comfortable
I purchased a pair of these 3 years ago and they have been excellent
At the gym, on the plane, and when working in the yard
When my teenage daughter "borrowed" them I decided another pair was in order
I am happy to report the bass is just as strong, and mids and highs are just as clean and clear
Noise isolation is pretty decent for air travel and they are very comfortable to wear
I highly recommend, especially when currently priced almost 50% than the originals purchased previously
She uses them everyday and she raves about them when asked
I've been using the standard earbuds provided by Apple with their iPods, which is my point of comparison for these earbuds
The Apple earbuds are hard plastic and come with these nylon sock-like covers, which I suppose are supposed to keep them inside your ears
However, those nylon sock-like covers are also very cheaply made and literally ripped to shreds in my efforts to place them on my earbuds
That meant no nylon sock-like covers and the Apple earbuds kept slipping out of my ears
These Sennheiser earbuds have three soft rubber ear pieces
I'm using the largest size and they fit just perfectly and are comfortable
Sound quality is superb
Bass is not overdone, despite the claim of "enhanced" bass
Rather, sound quality is balanced throughout
Noise isolation is also great
I'm used to over-the-ear sealed headphones that feel like they're vacuum sealed in place
That's kind of how these sound, but without that uncomfortable feeling of full sized headphones clamping down on your head
I am quite pleased
These are nice, but earbuds are always tough to keep in place
I use them all the time, while working
I would knock it down a star for the stupid asymmetric cord, but they sound so nice that I can't
The highs are high, the mids are clear and the bass is very nice
Going back to the horrible little things that came with my i-Pod, the difference is night and day
My father-in-law purchased these for me and they are the best headphones that I have ever used
Unfortunately, my original set was cut in half by the chevy logo on my car (true story)
Luckily, Amazon had a sale on them and I was able to get another set for half of the price of the original
ProsEar buds are comfortable and elegantSound quality is great, enhanced bass is noticeableBest noise isolation I've experienced with ear budsCannot yet comment on how long they lastComes with two sets of replacement tips/ear adaptersPouch is sturdyConsThe pouch would be more convenient if it had a tiny zip section for the extra ear adapters- I am already concerned with losing them
Packaging seemed extra complex for no reason
Got it on time
Good sound quality(best considering I got it for $25)
Been using it for 2 weeks now and so far so good
This is great , what a nice gift
I have had trouble hearing out of other earbuds but the sound is really pretty good from these
They fit in my ear well also
Nice that it came with a little bag to keep them in
Considering all the great reviewsi was pretty excited to try out these headphones
Sadly, they did not live up to the hype in my opinion
I'm not an audiophile but I thought my $10 pair of Sony earbuds put out a superior sound quality to these
They aren't bad, just not mind blowing like I expected
so far it works pretty well, and sound quality is above average
I haven't try to run or exercise with it, which i don't think is what it meant to do
As usual, Sennheiser offers excellent quality
I do not claim to be an expert on sound quality but the audio range seems excellent
I appreciate the small, medium, large selection of ear bud covers
My only issue is that none of the sizes fit very securely in my ears
I use these occasionally but usually grab my wireless Bluedio Revolution earphones first
I must say that these earbuds do have excellent sound
Sound came through clearly even at louder volumes
Satisfied with the quality and even more so on the discount for this deal
I have used earbuds for extended periods for 25 years
I work as a Swimming Pool Service Tech and can listen to podcasts all day
The  Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds are the best I have ever tried
Consumer Reports was right
They work well with my ipod shuffle
I clip the shuffle on my shirt sleeve and run the wires under my shirt and out the neck and they stay out of the way while I work
The gold plated connectors don't corrode, which is what causes the other earbuds to fail
I not big on headphones but I was recommend these pair by a friend and they are fantastic
With these ear buds I actually heard some things in songs that I didn't with other ones I've owned
I don't have to blast my iPod to hear the song
Most of the time I have it at about a quarter with these ear buddies
I wish it had a built in microphone to I could use voice command or Skype
But they're meant for music and they do just the job
When you amplify the max sound, it will happen noise
I try it is not the music issue, because when I don't use it, it sound good
Great product I am hearing music as I have never heard it before
Would recommend to anyone looking to improve their iPod performance
I've had these for about a month
and I'm not a product junkie, all I want from my headphones are a great sound and comfort in my ears
At first I was annoyed b/c of uneven wires of the headphones, the right side is longer than the left and I guess it's suppose to make it more comfortable when running but when I use them when studying at my desk the longer side kept slipping out of my ear, even when I changed the size of the ear buds
Turns out it I didn't place it in my ears probably once I figured that out problem solved
Now, the sound
it's amazing
I use Pandora and I could tell the difference from my other headphones instantly
the sound is clearer and crisper
it feels as though you are in front of the artist
every little sound is heard, sounds I didn't realize were even there when I used my other headphones
They aren't noise-cancelling but because the sound is so clear and the buds go into the ear, it blocks out other sounds effectively
1 month later
After using the headphones for another month, I'm reducing it to 3 stars
The ear buds continue to slip out of my ears even though I've tried the bigger size
Furthermore, the cord is always in the way while studying at my desk
The sound is still great (comparable to the Bose headphones in fact) but these just aren't comfortable due to the constant adjustment of the ear buds and fighting with the wires
I bought these for my teen daughter to replace a much loved and worn out pair of Bose earbuds
Sadly these were nothing like as good
Although the description says they offer a "powerful, bass-driven stereo sound with greater clarity and improved dynamics" the sound is actually rather tinny and thin
Bottom line is we returned them and bought another pair of Bose
Bought these and used them once
Sound was HORRIBLE and the design is idiotic
Total waste of money
I have Sennheiser headphones and love them and hoped that the ear buds sound nearly as good
Have bought these twice in the past from Amazon
The first pair were genuine and were great
I would definitely recommend these as good to use
After jamming this pair in a door by accident, the next set bought from Amazon were fake and of poor quality
You could see the difference in them immediately, and the pouch with them was of poor quality
After buying this third set, I'm not convinced these are genuine
When plugged into my iPhone, the sound does not always work when on FaceTime with family abroad
The case, although not as obvious as the previous fake ones, does not seem the same quality as my first set
I'm now reluctant when buying certain products from Amazon

These earbuds work great and sound great too
The price makes them a great deal
I would recommend them to anyone looking for a decent pair of earbuds at a great price
So I have been using this product for over a month, and have got to say, I am very impressed with these headphones
The sound quality is outstanding, and clarity is superb
For those of you transitioning from the standard $10/$20 headphones at some store, or the stock headphones that come with phones such as the iphone, you will notice a huge difference in sound
The headphones also fit great in the ears, and do not slip out like the cheap kind if you get the correct bud
Overall, I was very impressed and will buy again in the future should my pair need replacing
I am not an audiophile by any means but these headphones sound great
The $40 sale price has made them just that much better
My wife came back and got a pair we were so impressed
The title says it: I am not an audiophile, but my simple review is that I love these earbuds
I've gone through tens of $15-50 pairs over the years, and I really wanted an upgrade
This pair was well worth the extra money
The bass response isn't overwhelming and the treble is very pleasantly crisp, and doesn't really ever get sharp and unpleasant
The staggered wire lengths of the left and right ears helps immensely with tangling
So, if you're somebody who just wants to get an upgrade from low-priced earphones, I would say these are a great choice
Like the headphones and they produce all the highs and lows my other ones do, with good bass too that's definitely noticeable
They mentioned the asymmetrical cords, the one for the right one is probably twice as long which personally I think is just stupid and pointless but it doesn't bother me too much
Overall good headphones and I've had them for almost a year and they still work perfectly, and if anyone's wondering they fit with my otterbox defender on my iphone
If your comparing these to the other cheaper pair of Sennheiser CX200 Twist-to-Fit Earbuds, definitely get this one above all
the CX 300B just sounds much better and less harsh to the ear drums than the cheaper CX200
The bass is strong and impactful without being loud, it is really designed for bass heavy dance or hip-hop tracks
High Quality pair of head phones
I like a lot of bass from my ear buds and the bass wasn't as spectacular as I expected, but it is still solid
The awesome sound clarity makes up for the decent bass
Overall, they are great ear buds let you hear music, the highs and lows, significantly more clearly and with better clarity
Then, I thought I lost them
So I immediately bought another set for less than $30
Found the first pair
It was a steal
These headphones were well beyond what I was asking for
I take them everywhere I go
Very comfortable, even at the gym
Amazing sound and material quality, sick bass for a pair of headphones, and alot more affordable than its Beats by Dre adversary
Although $70 is a bit too steep, knocking the price down to $50 met the maximum price I was willing to pay
I say it's money well spent as long as you can make the headphones last
These are probably the best "affordable" pair of headphones out there
Thats what you get for great quality
Good job Sennheiser
Though these have enhanced bass, it is not overwhelming and the audio balance is wonderful
They are extremely comfortable to wear, and are built well (as one would expect from Sennheiser)
Spend the money & get a pair of quality buds
These are rated in the top three & well worth it
You'll enjoy the sound
Sound seem to be mildly muffled, mids and highs sound tinny
Bass is very nice though
Get these in-ears if you don't care much about sound quality but you want bumping bass

I had tried a pair my son had ordered
I Soooo liked the way they fit, stay put, and give you the musical experience I wanted
I liked them so much that I bought two, hiding the second one for back-up
This is not what he originally wanted, but after checking sennheiser out, he was willing to give them a try
Great price, great shipping, and he loves them
Good crisp sound from the earbuds which I use while running
Packaging can be shrunked down in size
Good for environment
I LOVE IT
I'm very happy whit this product
It is just what I wanted it
No regrets at all
You're better off with some Apple earbuds
I bought these thinking the quality of sound would be better than the quality on my current Apple earbuds
I'm disappointed to say they are not
The biggest flaw in it, in my opinion, is the right cable is almost two times longer than the left
I don't know why those chose to design it this way, but it looks completely stupid
Why have a wire hanging loosely while the other one doesn't
Do you want me to wrap it around my neck until I choke myself
I just returned mine
The ear buds sound great, but where the cod "Y"s one of the wires is only 6 inches long and the other is about 16 inches (normal length)
I am stationed in Kabul Afghanistan, already destroyed the packaging and no way of returning
so pretty much stuck with it
I love Sennheiser ever since I stumbled on to them about 4 years ago
I went through many different brands before I found Sennheiser
The sound quality has always been some of the best
The capacity for bass is not as I would like it but the audio is crisp
The quality of the earphone material is very high in that I can put these in my pocket, get them tangled and often during my working they may get snatched out because I work in some small areas
If you are like me and tired of having to replace other brand earphones because of such things then I would also suggest Sennheiser for you
If you would like quality earphones then I would suggest these
I really love the sound and feel of these earbuds, but sadly after around 4-5 months of heavy use (every day) my right ear bud has stopped making sound, which is just plain annoying when you are trying to  listen to music
But since I loved the earbuds so much, I'm off to buy another pair
Sound came through clearly even at louder volumes
Satisfied with the quality and even more so on the discount for this deal
I have used earbuds for extended periods for 25 years
I work as a Swimming Pool Service Tech and can listen to podcasts all day
The  Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds are the best I have ever tried
Consumer Reports was right
They work well with my ipod shuffle
I clip the shuffle on my shirt sleeve and run the wires under my shirt and out the neck and they stay out of the way while I work
The gold plated connectors don't corrode, which is what causes the other earbuds to fail
For the price, I like these
The mids and highs sounds great, but the "enhanced bass" could be better
You have to really cram these little things in your ears to get any bass at all, so that means for me using the smallest of the three sizes of rubber squishy things
Also, the material the cord is coated with makes it really easy for them to get tangled up, which is pretty annoying
I have to say I'm really liking the asymmetrical split in the cord for each bud (In case anyone was wondering--the left bud is the one with the shorter cord)
All in all, pretty good sound, nice and clear but there could be more bass
First off I would like to say these earbuds are worth their full price luckily I got it on the black friday sale
The sound quality is very good and has good bass
They don't tangle much
The only problem I have with these earbuds is that the right side is longer than the left which I don't understand
Great gift idea for teenager or college student
College student love them
I love when I save money and get it right
Daughter says thes are the best
was grateful for the gift
She has tried out several brands and wanted these as the clarity was best
I have a set of Sennheiser head phones (HD-598) and love them
So, when earbuds were requested as a gift I went with Sennheiser
definitely the best pair of earbuds i've ever come across
haven't worked out with them yet but they really cover the entire musical spectrum phenomenally
the sound isolation is also great, so you won't hear anything up to hyper-moderately loud noises
for their price i don't think they face any competition on the market
very comfortable in the ear, doesn't make your outer ear sore at all
nice work, Sennheiser
the one con i can think of is the uneven cord length, the left bud has a shorter slack than the right one and, as a person who enjoys symmetry, that annoys me
if you can overlook the oddly designed wire, then by all means invest in these
I think this is the best earbuds that could be get within this money
I believe in sennheiser's quality and voice
While I have been trying many of the more expensive in-ear buds over the years this is the first pair I have noted an improved listening experience
the buds that I replaced with the Sennheiser buds were nearly $50
00
I actually thought I was going deaf or my MP3 (Ipod) was finally failing
upon plugging these in and using them I had to turn the volume down over 50% so I could even hear enough to think
good sound quality, and great price
I've had these for about a month now and I can say very little against these ear buds
Like it says in the title the bass is fantastic and if you like hearing the bass in your music you need this product
I am also a PC gamer and I now use these as my everyday gaming sound periferals
They are much more comertable that the Astro A40's I used to use
My only con to these are that the highs can get a bit scratchy
I found it worst when listening to Bad Guy by Eminem when the girl sang
Besides that I 100% recommend these ear buds
You will love these they sound great , the bass is really good great value for the price no noise
The ear buds sound great
Even better than I expected
Bass is great, just as good as beats I would say
Great sound, earbuds stay in while working out
I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend to anyone
I have standard Apple earbuds that have much better sound
The fit is uncomfortable
One earbud cord is longer than the other
I suppose it is to wrap around the neck, but as a walker, the movement tends to pull the longer cord so I am adjusted them all the time
I wouldn't buy these again
When I purchased the earbuds, I didn't realize they were also noise-canceling
As a result, I had various people stop by my desk to talk to me and I didn't notice they were there -- works really well
Sound is also very good to my non-audiophile ears
Sound is excellent
Noise isolation is just fine
Have had other sennheiser products in the past
They are quality products
Very uncomfortable no matter which of the three sizes of bud adapter I tried; plus the cord on the right ear bud is twice as long as the left (what's that for
)
But the one star rating is earned because of the poor sound quality; muddy booming bass, tinny high notes and no midrange punch
Just crap
Also, I made the mistake of buying them in late October as a "stocking stuffer" for myself, so I didn't try them until Christmas, which turns out to be a month too late to return them
Read a review of these ear buds and found the best price on Amazon
The sound quality is very food and they fit the ear canals perfectly
Piece of junk
The highs are too harsh even with a week of burning in
Ever compared Hi Fi Speakers with PA speakers
That's what the Sennheiser CX300B sounds like_PA speakers
I have this one for a more than a year , this is great
The sound and design are so good
I like these earbuds very much
I use them mainly for audio books
They block the ambient noise on planes, so listening is a pleasure
These headphones packed an incredible power, with bass so brilliant that I could feel it reverberating throughout my brain
The audio was crisp and not at all fuzzy
Wire was a little strange though
My only problem is that these broke down 4 months after I began to use them, and I kept them in the case constantly, bundling carefully and not wrapping
The left one got gradually quieter and quieter, then the right one jumped to the left one's audio level to the point where I could barely hear anything at all
Definitely disappointing, because I was in love with them
(My first ever review) I bought these earbuds at the same time as my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled Cableand gave each a couple hours of listening
The mid's and high's on these earbuds are better then any other earbuds I have tried and almost as good as my m50
I can say prior to the M-50 the most expensive headphones I have purchased is the skullcandy skullcrushers Skullcandy S6SKFZ-003 Skullcrusher - Black the $45 range which is a waste of money
These earbuds are the best earbuds for mids and high "not headphones" I have tried but the bass is terrible vs the $15 sullcandy ones you can get anywhere
Skullcandy INK"D Earphones
I would get the skullcandy's but I put a little emphasis on bass
I have to say I have listened to the $100-$300 range of beats and they suck, so I actually know what I am talking about in terms of audio and build quality
At $30 if you don't care about bass buy these but if you do, spend $15 on skullcandy
I was not a believer in expensive headphones until I tried them but if you are able to save up to <$150 and buy the Audio Technia ATH-M50 they are soo much better then any headphone or speaker ($150 each) I have used
Only time I would bring these is if I have only 2x2 inch of space for headphones otherwise I will always bring my M50's now
I haven't tried these earbuds myself but I'm told that they provide excellent sound quality with a high level of comfort and at a very good price
First, note that one earbud is longer than the other
I believe this is meant so that the longer earbud can go around your neck and you'll have less cable in fromt of you
Fair, but unconventional
Sound quality is good for the price, but so is klipsch
Where these falter is that the cable feels flimsy and low quality, and the earbuds themselves feel cheap
The fit of the earbud is not very good, and I always have to push them into my ear again
The Klipsch S4 oval tipped earbuds are the best in class in terms of fit
Overall, it's ok
I'm thinking about returning these for Klipsch S4s
They work well, have good sound quality, and no issues yet
The unequal headphone length is odd to get used to at first (I know many people list this as a major con) but I don't mind it because I'm usually listening to music while biking or running
I got them on sale during Cyber Monday sale for $40 so I thought I couldn't go wrong
I have had multiple pairs of Skullcandy Ink'd headphones in the past (which worked well) however the cord always broke on them
Since these came with a 2 year warranty, I figured I had nothing to lose
On side of the head phone i could literately wrap them around my neck and still have enough slack still to put them in my ears
These are great
Comfortable, sound fantastic
Awesome for people who do not want to spend $200 bucks but want nice sound
I'm not an earbud guy, but I bought a pair for airline trips
Sonically, they work wonderfully
They are not noise cancelling, but that's never really been an issue on the plane
Fit is OK
again, would not have to wear them for any length of time
CLEAR SOUND, amazing bass, and a unique setup really impress me and are the reason why I enjoyed these headphones
I loved the sound quality that these headphones provided
Truly a nice experience for such inherently small speakers
However, there appears to be a design flaw
The 3
5mm plug that you plug has a strange design where it the plug is connected to a 2cm long piece of semi-hard plastic which then makes a right turn for a centimeter until it turns into a standard cord
Not sure if this has some specific purpose that I wasn't aware of, but within a month or two of purchasing these headphones, the connection inside the semi-hard plastic component went completely bad
At first I lost sound in the left earbud and eventually it lost sound in both buds
I am sure it is a connection issue because squeezing the plastic element in certain places will cause sound to temporarily come in either one or both earbuds
this is average, i expected more from the quality of sound
its crisp is there, but again, its not like what i expected
I wasn't sure I would be able to find something to replace my favorite Sony ear buds
I'm very happy to report these ear buds are amazing
The loudness, clarity and range is just what I was looking for
I'm so tempted to buy another pair just in case I need to replace the set I just bought
ProsGreat soundStay and click in your earGood build qualityBest ear buds for the priceConsOne ear bud is longer than the other meant for listening with one earbud in but gets very annoying
Such a high quality for small Earbuds and the price is right
I was impressed with everything includes the fast shipment
Pros : I used numerous in ear headphones, Klipsch Image S4, Etymotic ER6i, etc
The CX300B has a noticeably stronger bass compared to most headphones I had before, but not to the point that is distracting
I mostly listen to pop, rock and funk
If you are a bass addict, the CX300B might not be enough to stop your heartbeat
The mid range is reasonably clear and detailed enough to pick out the weaker instruments playing at the background
All in all, the sound quality is superb considering the price
Cons :1) However, there are two things I don't like
The asymmetric cord design causes all the frictional force (from rubbing on my cloths) pulling on the left ear piece
Many time it causes the barely seated correctly ear piece (another problem) to come off
The cord to the right ear piece is also pulling too much when I look over to my left shoulder, pulling that ear piece off too
It became so annoying that I need to do something about it
2) The fitting of the ear piece can be better
As everyone knows, these in ear headphones only sound right if they are snug in your ears with no gap between the ear tip and your ear canal
The Large, Medium and small ear tip that came with the CX300B doesn't offer too much sizing options
It is like offering a T-shirts that has only three sizes, XXXL, M and XXXS
The medium tips works reasonably well for me when I am walking and sitting down, but beyond that I doubt it will stay put
For example, I found both Klipsch Image S4 and Etymotic ER6i offers a much better and secure fit
What I had to do is to replace the original asymmetric cord with the symmetric one from my Klipsch (which was accidentally tossed in the washing machine in my jeans pocket)
Now I say my $30 is well spent
These are very good quality headphones for the price, I bought these Sennheiser headphones for $30 5 days ago and received them today
So far I absolutely love these headphones, the audio quality is pretty good (keep in mind I am no audiophile) the highs and mids are clear and the bass is surprisingly bumping, which is good for me because I mainly listen to bass heavy hip hop/rap music
I also like the soft case with the clasp it comes with, it's easy to just throw my headphones in there and stick them in my pocket
As far as durability goes I wouldn't know since I got the headphones today, I will say the chord does seem pretty thin and flimsy
Besides that my only complaint is the asymmetric cable design, where the right ear headphone cable is almost three times as long as the left ear cable
I honestly have no idea why someone would favor this over the normal "v" design, but this isn't a deal breaker for me because these are great headphones and definitely worth the thirty dollars I got them for
Some people say break in is a myth or is completely psychological
I don't know who is right, but what I do know is that out of the box I was 100% displeased with the sound of these headphones
I thought they were tiny and muddled- no better than $20 headphones from any other retailer
Before sending them back I decided I would go ahead and break them in for a few days
Rather than use pink, white, etc noise, I just let them play through my shuffled playlist for about 3 days non-stop
After that they really sounded like a new pair of headphones
Great clarity, nice low end extension, warmer mid range- pretty much everything I was expecting from them before
First off, the packaging and the accessories were nicely done
I like the pouch a lot, and the pads come in a good variety of sizes to fit well
The uneven cord lengths for the left and right ear don't impress me, but don't annoy me either
As for the sound quality, it's hard to ignore the bass punch
My wife settled in to them right away because they sound big
Myself, I like a healthy bass response to my music, but these over exaggerate it
Bass isn't why I listen to music, it's just nice to get a full sound
I found myself turning up the volume to hear vocals and more intricate details better, only to discover the bass was notably distorting them
Bad enough that I couldn't ignore it
Subjective, I know, but don't pretend that these are HiFi
Afforadable, well made, but bass heavy at a cost

The highs are too harsh even with a week of burning in
Ever compared Hi Fi Speakers with PA speakers
That's what the Sennheiser CX300B sounds like_PA speakers
Don't  waste your money the sound was horrible the review says I have to give a rating but I feel that is was so bad that it does not deserve a rating
If you're coming from a pair of Skullcandy earbuds of any model, these will be a huge improvement
They isolate outside noise very well, the bass is very prominent without being muddy
The music is clear despite the large amount of bass
They also get quite loud
Would recommend to anyone who needs an affordable pair of IEMs with lots of bass, particularly the Skullcandy crowd
the cord for the earbuds are different lengths
1 is very short the other is very long not very comfortable
I have been using the Sennheiser earbuds for a about a week now and I am really impressed with the sound quality for only 30 bucks
Great lows and clean highs
While I would not put them on the same level as something like Shure in ear monitors($100+) they still really good
i wish I could return these
Based on the reviews I thought I would be blown away with the sound quality
The sound is distorted
Almost sounds like no bass
Also these fall out of ears really easy
Surprisingly nice
I've not had other headphones to compare but I've used them in a Live band and on my MP3 player
Have 3 pairs due 8 years
Best price\quality rate
Price above 25-30$ is just black hole for you money
Never buy other headphones
sound quality was very good
Bass very punchy, treble was nice as well
The only problem i could not get a good fit for my ear
Had to add the loop off my blue tooth
Will order additional loops which will solve that problem
I am very disappointed with these Sennheiser earphones
1) they do not fir properly in my ears, no matter which buds I put on
2) the treble is dull and 3) the bass is simply non-existent
For the same price, please get the official Apple Earbuds, they are truly incredible
For the money, these earbuds are the BEST
Great sound, great fit with the three different sized ear covers to choose from
Pros: Very good sound quality for price
Bass and treble are plenty clear
They are also a comfortable fit
Cons: I'm still trying to get use to the "J" instead of "Y" shaped cable
Headphones seem to add some hiss to the sound
I will say it's Ok
Anyway, it's a 20-dollar thing and good, because you will not expect too much
If it is the original price around 80, I will not buy it
Good bass and overall a very comfortable in ear headphones, you will not be disappointed with this good bang for the buck buy
I accidentally left these earbuds inside of my jack when I decided to do laundry
I was astonished when I came to find out that the earbuds had survived both the washer and the dryer
I feel dumb now, but hell thanks
These earbuds are worth the money
I really like this headset it is simple and easy fashion beautiful and powerful
No light weight sound quality is very good song
NINE (9) years have passed since I bought the CX300 in Europe, 9 years serving almost everyday
These IEM (In Ear Monitors) gave me thousands of hours (and miles) of music, movies or simply isolating the airplane noise
I've had some Sony, Samsung, Philips and all of them ended in the botton of some drawer of broken in hands of one of my children
I've always returned to the beloved CX300 and in the last 3 years I completelly forgot the idea of buying any new pair of IEMs
Why
Because the CX300 demonstrated me why it is one of the most successfull IEM in history
They come with the following factors:TOUGH: CX300 demonstrated me they are tough
Not many IEM whistand years in my pocket without any protective case or pouch (The current version comes with a pouch)
SOUND QUALITY: I am not an audiofile, but I listen different kind of music, and movies
their bass is immersive, deep and outstanding to my ears
It is not saturated by any means and treble is crystal clear
When listening to movies, they are wide and immersive, these IEM put you in the middle of the action
BASS: I have to double this feature since I like powerful bass in EDM and action movies
It is difficult to hear real deep and immersive bass while enjoying the rest of the spectrum and this product makes the impossible
High quality high, mids a AWESOME bass
IT also provides a good sensitivity so no need to pump up the volume in the player device
SLEEP: Their housings are so small that you can fell sleep on it
And this is important since In an airplane or in the bed they provide just sound to your ears, not any pressure due to big housings between your ear and the pillow
NON INTRUSIVE ISOLATION: The isolation is better than average with the simple but effective isolation silicon
You do not feel them deep inside and they are really comfortable for wearing them on long flights of more than 10 hours
It is clear that I have been more than satisfied with the CX300, my only issue what the plating of the connector
Last year (and after 8 years of service) the connector started to make some creepy noise when it was moved in the socket, but I can understad that after carrying them in my pockets for years without any case or pouch
They are tough and I do not have any doubt about this
But I lost them and I had to buy a the current product
It is the same but it also comes with a nice pouch
Oh
and the L connector is gold plated and look toughter than the previous model
Totally recommended
Tracking says it was delivered 7 days ago but I still haven't seen it yet
I wonder what kind of legs it grew
Return says it has to be delivered back to them but I have nothing to deliver back to them if I never received it in the first place
I really don't want to return it, that is why I bought it
I just wish it would get here so I could try it out
The head phones work great
I wish they weren't around the neck ones
The bass is decent but not the best
The amount of sound and bass that come out of these little earbuds are great
The range is great, and the bass is even better
I highly recommend these
Good sound for the money
Noise reduction without the large head phones or price tag
I would buy them again
I went through 3 pairs of Bose $100 ear buds over the last 4-5 years
I love the fit of the Bose, and the sound, but I was not ready to go there again with my money
Figured I'd give these Sennheisers a try for 30 bucks
After 1 week, I am pretty pleased
I think I like the fit of the Bose buds better, due to the ear cavity shaped silicon
With these buds, you have to push them further into your ear cavity to achieve a secure hold
Once you do that, and can get used to that, the sound is excellent, including the bass frequencies
The thing I'm having to get used to is the feel and the sound of my own breathing and movement
With the buds pushed in as far as is required, I can hear my every breath and step, more so than I ever did with the Bose
Try try this sensation, stick your fingers in your ears really securely, and walk or run around a bit
That's what the "silence" sounds like when these are in
Of course, if you're playing music or listening to a book, so what
On the bright side, noise from outside seems to be more adequately blocked with these Sennheisers
Overall, I think I'm going to like these, now that I've figured out why the left side is shorter than the right
Reviews on head-fi/ headroom/ etc
tell the truth, one of the best pairs of earbuds for under $50
or $26 if your lucky like me
Picked up some skullcandy titans the other day for $20 and I almost wish I just added $6 more for another set of these
;)
This phone looks like seconds
The ear buds cable are different lengths
One ear bud cord is aboutnine inches the other is twice as long
Be careful with these ear buds
The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the fast shipping & tight packaging
Cheaply made and sounds terrible
When first used the left speaker stopped working almost immediately
Returned
I am comparing these to my HD600s, so maybe I am spoiled, but these are tinny and way too bright
Handclaps sound like pulses of white noise and cymbals are overly shrill and bright
Very fatiguing to listen to these for more than 20 minutes
I'm wondering if the highs are what are really enhanced on these
Also, the longer lead is a solution to a non-existent problem
I f'n hate it
Overall, I wish I bought something else
These have a better fit than generic earbuds, and a bit more bass, but they are not worth the money
High-fidelity
No
But seriously, you're not going to get audiophile quality at this price
I'm just tired of throwing away $200 earphones that break after a few months, so I got these with the understanding that they're disposable
As a point of reference, I'll admit to being an audiophile
Most of my listening is on expensive speakers in an acoustically-treated room, or on high-quality over-ear headphones
My idea of high-fidelity is admittedly snobbish
Clearly, the many 5-star reviewers here have lower expectations
Sound-quality: much better than the cheap plastic things that came with your iPod, but bass-hyped with scooped mids
Can be mitigated somewhat with your player's EQ
Build quality: very flimsy, like all of them
You could damage it just removing it from the packaging, so be careful
Comfort: good
As comfortable and secure as any others I've owned, including some costing 10x as much
Haven't tried it for long periods yet, though
I'll find out on my next trans-Pacific flight in 2 months
Isolation: that's the reason you buy in-ears, to shut out the world and be able to listen in noisy environments such as airplanes
These do fine, but it depends on finding the right tips
Summary: I'll use these when traveling until they break, then I'll toss 'em
If they last more than 6 months there's a good chance I'll buy another pair of these
Really good earbuds
They have great bass and are one of my best purchases yet
They are very isolated and you can turn them up load and nobody else can hear your music
sound is really good and basses are too
In this price this is really good choice
I am pretty satisfied
So far, the headphones are working very well
They were a Christmas gift for my son so he's only been using them a few days, but he is very happy with them at this point
These headphones sound really good, and I like the shape of the part that connects to the jack
This makes it so your headphone wires won't rip from over bending it
Only problem I have are the ear buds, they are pretty cheap quality and could of been a little bit better
None of the sizes would be right for me, because all of them will cause the headphone to slide out of my ear
This is due to the design of the earbud, but other than that the earbud fits in my ear fine, ignoring the fact that one headphone would easily fall out of my ear
Overall these headphones pack a punch into the sound quality, but honestly they are not worth the price
I got these on black friday for $20
the product is good, I just dont like the cord
the right side is much longer than than the left side
I bought these for my husband and he loves them
They have a very good sound and are great for the price
I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again
The base is not up to par and these do NOT have a microphone
Will be returning for an upgraded model that has better sound and more features
I'm impressed with how great the sound is on these headphones
If you're looking for something cheap but with actual quality, don't be hesitant to buy these headphones in particular
I've owned these since August and they still work as well as when I first got them
These are a lot smaller than I expected, but they sound great
I love that they are small because i can fall asleep with them on and they don't bug my ears while I'm sleeping
Great product, only flaw would have to be the two different cord lengths
It doesn't really bother me, but I'd prefer them to be the same length
Overall, better than my Skullcandy 50/50 and my J-Lab J4
The sound on these isn't as good as some sonys I have used but they sure are far more durable and I feel like they will last me forever
If you want long lasting earbuds that you can bring around anywhere than definitely buy these
I bought these for durability after my 2nd sony pair eventually malfunctioned and they're still going strong after nearly 2 years
4/5 for sound quality5/5 for reliability
I bought them for reliability primarily so 5/5 for me
pretty good but too much base, I like CX200 better, which has a deeper base(not louder) and a more crystal-like treble
These are excellent headphones they do have an awesome bass amplifier added to it but they have a granny sound to it which is a  down side to me
I see the cable is also kind of long
I use that to my advantage, I can easily make the cable go trough my back and i can use my headphones during class
I find this headphones to be excellent for in earbuds, over all I would give it a 8/1010 being just perfect 1 being s***
so they are pretty good
To start, I purchased these because I had been using Klipsch Image S4i's since they were released
I went through two pairs with heavy use
After reading a ton of product reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, I decided to give these a try
These were cheaper than what I could find another pair of Image S4's for (they fluctuate in price alot)
My thoughts in comparison, these are a lot heavier on the low end, but almost to the point where any mid-range clarity is lost unless these are perfectly set in your ears which is hard to do at the gym
Hi's were also lacking
Klipsch excels on the mid to hi clarity where these were low end focused
I also am a fan of the oval shape Klipsch utilizes rather than the traditional round that the Sennheiser's have
Pros:Price pointGood low rangeSlightly thicker cord than some of the competitionQuality buildDurable (gym use, no cord noise to note when active)L shape cord connectNice carrying caseCons:Lacking in the Mid-Hi range (I listen to primarily EDM and acoustical music)Contains 3 size earbuds but none seem to fit exactly the way they shouldSound almost mono if your earbuds are not in the perfect position (a problem while working out)All in all, great for the price I paid
My verdict however, is go with the Image S4i's if the price is within $10
I have had enough with Bose headphones
I have owned a few Bose headphones and I've had a bad luck with  them
They either break on me or I lose them
Me being in Afghanistan didn't help either :)
This headsets by far are the best I ever owned
They sound amazing
They are also priced very reasonably
I got mine for under 40 bucks
You can't beat that with a stick ;) I highly recommend this product
Just to give a bit of background, I own a pair of Sennheiser HD-650's and headphone amplifiers so I know what higher end stuff sounds like
The CX 300B MK II's have great bass response and overall excellent sound quality
They do a good job of blocking out ambient noise
So much so that I found myself vacuuming with the vacuum cleaner off
I didn't realize that the vacuum was off until it wasn't sucking up a spec of dirt on my floor
That's how quiet these can be
They felt great in my ears and come with different size buds to try
They come in a small leather case that could be a little bit bigger
You need to give these headphones about 10 hours or so to break-in
At first the bass was a bit harsh and the treble was bright and washed out
Every time a singer in a track pronounced an "sh" word like shine for instance, there was harsh treble and cymbals were also harsh
Once they were broken in though they sounded great
Those are the pros
The cons are the chord
The chord is extremely thin and extremely flimsy
Almost as thin and pliable as dental floss
These headphones lasted me one week
The insulation on one of the wires is completely split exposing bear wire
One channel of the headphones thus no longer works
So I spent $30 for something that lasted me a week
The headphones that came with a galaxy S4, which I was using when I didn't want to lug around my giant HD-650's, have lasted me almost a year and I haven't even kept them in a case
So I would stay away from these
You can't replace the chord like you can in other Senn's I own and they are not made to survive portable use
throwing them in a bag, getting them snagged on things, etc
The sound quality is very good ear, cost is very high, the quality is really good, I love it
Next time will buy
Very beautiful and stylish
Simple and elegant, high-quality
Value for money
I would recommend it to everyone
Another benefit is that it has a nice
not an audiophile
but digital bass yes it handles that
but actual bass guitar and maybe its my old ipod nano but the eq is set on jazz and still distortion happens
clear sounding on the Treble but still on some live recordings the voices sound muddled and maybe thats on the engineers who produced the live tracks
but they are better than your 10 dollar variety head phones
of course the suggested retail price is suggested
so who knows
The sound quality on these headphones rock
They've got a nice deep base and crystal clear to match
I would say the only thing I don't like about these headphones is that where the cord splits to two wires for the earbuds, they make the left side considerably shorter
I know many headphone manufacturers do this, but I can't think of a good reason why
Overall great headphones
The pair I got was counterfeit
I couldn't return them because I live out of the United States and I got this pair while I was visiting
This pair came in a suspicious packaging
Print on the box is not clear
The bag that it came with has a tag that has weird letter font and feels cheap
The connector seemed poorly made and had extra plastic that was supposed to be cleaned
My friend had a pair of the same model that was purchased from HK
Much better than this pair
Definitely fake
I'm on my 3rd pair of Sennheiser CX 300's
Don't mistake that for a mark against the build quality of these earbuds as each pair has far outlasted competing products from Shure and Sony
I used these daily over the past 5 or so years while running and working out
One pair was destroyed when it became entangled in the track of a rowing machine
The other was smashed by a weight plate
The Shure and Sony competition fell apart of it's own accord
The sound, fit, and value of these can't be beat
These are fantastic for listening to music while walking, riding public transport, or at home
Incidentally, I have recently switched to another Sennheiser product for use while working out, the PMX 685i, which depending on the fit I would recommend over these for those purposes
The 300s actually sound better, but tend to produce a lot of chord noise when running
I just received these earphones today and have started burning them in
To test the bass I started with BTO's - "Not Fragile"
The opening bass line told me what I needed to know about these
I then tested some John Henry Bonham on Zeppelin's - "In My Time of Dying"
Finally, a little Supertramp - "Give a Little Bit" gave me the nice, clear 12 string sound
At this price I'm going to pick up a couple of spare pairs
One pair won't last forever
(I'm still going to have to adjust to the different lengths of the earphone cords though
)
Nice buds, they are comfortable and sound great
another thing I like is that my ears don't fatigue like some of the over the ear headphones, and they stay in better then many of the others I've tried
The one dislike I have is the left side cable is kind of short, another being the thinness of the cable
As the temp's have gone down, the cable tends to get caught in the zippers of my jackets which usually results in one or both get pulled out of my ear
The sound is good though; clean, crisp and decent lows
I used to own previous version of CX 300 and was happy with them
I especially liked the j-style (asymmetrical) cable which allows for more comfort especially when wearing cable under the shirt
My previous CX300 cable broke at the plug joint so it's good to see that Sennheiser reinforced that part in this II version
The reason i'm not giving them more stars is that recently i got another pair of budget buds which cost only $10 and which have noticeably superior sound quality
I wasn't even aware of the lack of clarity of my Sennheiser CX 300B MK II until i compared them side by side with Monoprice 109927 Hi-Fis
300B distort on high end
Ts/tz sounds are saturated, it's as if somebody turns up the volume to 11 when there is a s or tz sound making everything sound kinda metallic/distorted
Unfortunately, Monoprice 109927 have a tangle prone cloth cable so overall CX300 are more comfortable to wear
But good sound is more imporant than a good cable
I will be wearing my Monoprice 109927 more often than my CX300s
I got these through cyber Monday for $13
Cheaper than the cheapest earbuds I've gotten in the past
These are, PHENOMENAL
There's actually sound isolation and when I first plugged these babies in I was blown away at how wonderful music sounds compared to all the other headphones (at a college students budget) I've owned
Those iPod headphones are dog fecal matter compared to these
If these had a control button, they'd be perfect
Yesterday I was walking back home and while I was crossing the street I thought I heard a weird noise
I finally looked around and it was a friend honking at me while they were stuck at a light
I barely noticed
You don't even have to have the volume cranked up to get the sound isolation
If only I had these for my runs outside before it got so cold here in MN
I don't write reviews often, probably the 3rd time ever, but these were sooo worth it
I'm no audio specialist, but I've gone through a ridiculous amount of headphones to say, you don't need those expensive Beats by Dre or whatever
I had those as a present until one of my cats ate them, but these honestly have sound quality up there
Now all those poor college students out there looking for the best cheap headphones that don't sound like the price, stop browsing the depths of amazon and just get these NOW
The cord is way too long and it is constantly getting tangled as a result of this and its sticky texture
I'm 6' tall and the cord hangs below my knees
It seems to me that the cord should never need to go below waist height
These earphones disappoint on so many levels
I bought these as a backup once my Monster Miles Davis Trumpet's died, and I needed to have a pair of earphones to hold me over while I waited for the Monster's to get replaced
However, I have to say that these earphones are horrible, worse than the Apple Earpod's (I have those lying around as well)
I am not an audiphile, but have had good earphones and headphones in the past (recent ones include the HD558, the Audio-Technicas ATH-M50, Monster Turbine  Pro Copper and etc)
These ones, even considering the low price point just bad
The level of detail is just lacking
The base is muddy and overpowers the mids and the highs
Its just a sub-par listening experience overall
The base is the biggest issue here, it just makes everything sound so muddy
I am not a big fan of the longer right ear as well, however I knew that coming in
Overall, I would advice you guys to looks elsewhere and if you can, spend a bit more to get a better pair of earphones, such as the CX890 or the Klipsch S4
Excellent product
Highly recommended
It offers a lot for a low price, if you are looking for something with great sound fidelityu, this is it
I love these headphones
They have such a great sound, great bass, are reasonably priced, and you don't have to worry about everyone on public transport hearing your music
This is my third pair in the last 6 years (they usually last about 2 years in my experience (although I also throw them in my handbag and don't put them in their little carrying case))
My only complaint that Sennheiser still hasn't seemed to work out in all of the years I've been buying these is the rubbery coating on the wires is so thin that you will get a little static electricity shock in your ear if you're wearing an outfit (or it's a really dry day) that might cause some static electricity
It's not like painful or anything, but it is annoying to get the shock in your ear
Obviously this hasn't been enough to turn me off ;)
Decent headphones, good for the price, the EQ balance of the headphones are a little off, sounds such as high-hats sound a little piercing, besides that it's not bad for the buck
I ordered these as "cheap" replacements for my other pairs (which, despite being different brands and different ages, all managed to break at the same time in slightly different ways) until I could buy an "expensive" pair
When I received these, based on the price I paid for them (about 20$) I was expecting the sound quality and sound canceling to be poor
This was not the case
The sound canceling is beautiful and works really well (about as well as expensive sound canceling headphones, though not quite as good) and the sound quality is as good as I would want it for everyday use
I am unsure about whether these are as good as is required for very music oriented professions, hobbies, etc, but they definitely work for me
I got these in-ear headphones knowing that other Sennheiser products I that I have bought had phenomenal sound, but, unfortunately, these headphones disappointed me
The sound is very tinny, and I hate the wires (one is longer than the other and tangle very easily)
I thought I could use these to replace my Bose in-ear headphones that break every year, but not so
The headphones that come with the iPhone is better than these
I can't recommend buying this product
However, the seller was awesome
I got them very quickly
These headphones are amazing for the price
At first right out of the box they sound clear and crisp already, did some burning and now they sound phenomenal
Fit for bassheads or audiophiles, or atleast you wont be disappointed, the highs are amazing, mids are great and the bass is not overpowered like the JVC extreme explosives and still boomy, which is superbbb
The asymmetrical cable isn't really that great but it's irrelevant if you're only using these for daily use, commuting etc
I personally don't really like the ear tips so I gave the JVC extreme explosives' ear tips a try and I noticed some changes in the isolation and bass, man I fell in love with them even more
Definitely a huge step up from Apple's 2nd gen Earbuds or pods
Great sounding headphones, and I love the extra long cable
Only thing missing is inline volume control/microphone, which I understood going into it
All in all I would buy them again
I have tried different Earbuds
I exercise with them and these are the best I have ever had
No compromise was made by Sennheiser by reducing high frequencies to enhance the low ones
These Earbuds have the best low frequencies for the price paid, deep and rich
I listen to all kinds of music but Jazz, Blues and Rock are my favorites
The true test was with a Pink Floyd live album recorded in Italy
The only reason why I did not give it all five stars was because as I exercise (run) the right speaker cable tends to weight to much and pull the speaker of my ear
Excellent sound
I had 2 pairs of these and loved both of them
I don't know what they call it but when one side has a longer cord and it is supposed to go behind the head
I don't really like that
Wish they were both the same length
Sound was as good as any in the ear monitors I have had
For the price, I have NEVER heard earbuds that sounded this good
Lows/Mids/Highs all sound excellent and the stage is expansive
The asymmetrical cord bothered me at first but I've gotten used to it and prefer to wrap the long end around the back of my neck at the gym
So far the buds seem to do what it says it will do
The music is clear bass sounds good
These earbuds are for all around, what I mean is you can listen to music, watch a movie, play games etc
These buds will do anything except extreme bass
I hear the JVC XX(xtreme xplosives) are the buds to get for xtreme bass
Good job Sennheiser
Honestly I love these, the sound is great and the noise isolation is perfect
I would've preferred a normal cord instead of one shorter that the other, though
I wouldn't buy again though, would want to try new ones :)
When used right the sound quality on these is better than I ever thought earbuds were capable of
However they also block out ambient sound pretty well so I have to pay attention when using them at work in case someone wants to talk to me
If the sound is tinny and terrible, you probably don't have them in right
I'm pretty sure the longer right cord is supposed to go around the back of your neck so it doesn't dangle a lot
Yea it's weird
Overall, very happy
Pros:Clear soundCheapgreat sound suppresionLast a long timecons:One headphone is longer than the otherkindof hurt my ears after a while of usage
L shaped jack, great for longegivty, but bad for pulling/putting back into pockets
The sound effect is amazing when I listen to  music using this sennheiser earbuds just as I was in the nature space
These stay in my ear but the cord makes lots of noise- not ideal for walking/running but good for use at the computer desk
The headphones are fine
I've had them for a month or so, and, so far, they are holding up fine physically
I am not a headphone snob, but the sound is perfectly pleasing
Two things to note: 1) the lengths of the individual headphones are different, which doesn't prevent wearing but can look awkward, and 2) there is no external control for volume etc (I knew this when purchasing)
I'll by stating WOW
These are the best earbuds I've had the pleasure of owning
I have a pair of Sennheiser PX 100, they are old over six years, but still sound great
Better than any other headphones that I have bought in the past
So with a little digging to find a good pair of earbuds for work and working out I found these
They are worth every penny, built very well, it sounds like I'm right there in the studio
The sound is crisp and clean, it blew me away
Thanks to Sennheiser, once again I'm falling in love with my music all over again
Well worth the price
I listen to earphones a lot, A LOT, at work, at home, ALL THE TIME
I am also not gentle on my electronics, and I have a fairly good ear from playing woodwinds for years and years
I am picky about my headphones and I don't like paying too much as I tend to have them disintegrate
Well, I am here to tell you that I have found my earbuds of choice
These are it
They are comfortable for my large ear canals, they block noise really well, they fit snug in my ear, and they don't hurt
They also sound very good, with clear high tones, plenty of middle, and a good bass
The bass isn't too muffled and sounds great, and it's just an overall clear, clean sound
I've had these for over two years, and they've also held up surprisingly well
I have bought way more expensive earbuds, and these outperform them
So, low price, great sound, good durability
Can't say enough good things about them
My only quibble is that I want more of the removable black cups that go in your ear, and had to purchase more when I lost one
For the price, these ear buds sound great
They have good bass, spacious highs, and the leather carrying pouch is a nice addition
While the asymmetrical design is a little annoying, i definitely recommend buying these
WOW
Bout all I can say about the buds
Absolutely the finest ear experience I've had outside a night out listening to "live" music
I bought this because I saw all the raving reviews about it
First, why on earth do they have different lengths for the right and left sides, it makes no sense, and if someone tells you it does, then ask why, because i don't get it
But what I got were basically the worst earphones i ever had
I have a better sound from the $5 ones i bought on another site
I run a lot so I wanted earbuds that would give me a great sound and would be comfortable to use when running
Not gonna work with those
The sound is awful, the bass is crackling so much it sounds like i'm frying something
Not for me
I have used these headphones for four years
I lose them every four month or so, but te affordable amazon price means I can buy them as needed
Excellent bass, fairly good at noise obstruction, and very comfortable
First off - yes, these earbuds do sound fantastic for the price
Problem is that I've gone through two pairs of these earbuds in the past two years
I bought the first pair in December 2011 from an unauthorized dealer and found out - a year later - that the warranty wouldn't be honored
My bad
So I bought a second pair directly from Amazon in February 2013
Ten months later, they had the same issue as the first pair: crackling sound in one of the earbuds
No problem, thought I, and submitted my warranty order right around Thanksgiving 2013
Two weeks later, Sennheiser sent the good news: they would be replacing my earbuds under warranty
And the bad: they'd run out of CX 300B MK II earbuds
They expected a new batch in February 2014
THREE MONTHS minimum to replace a pair of earbuds under warranty
Or, you know, I could drop more cash on another pair right here on Amazon, or any other website, because there's no real shortage of them
It's just that Sennheiser can't get their hands on a pair of their own earbuds
For three months
I understand that it takes time, but considering that my earbuds broke in ten months and it'll take another three months to get a replacement
that's bad, guys
I'm buying a pair of Panasonics to tide me over through Christmas, New Years', MLK Day, Presidents' Day, and Valentine's Day
And when the replacement Sennheisers break, as I'm sure they will, I will not bother ordering another pair
12/16/13 - Update; just got an email from Sennheiser saying that while the expected shipdate was 2/14/2014, my headphones would be shipped today
MUCH more reasonable
Still don't like that they break so quickly, but at least I've only been without headphones for one month instead of three
Accordingly, I'm changing my review from 1 star to 3
Very well-balanced all around
Not as tinny sounding as my old Ink'd/Smokin' Buds (Cant remember which) Skullcandy earbuds
I definitely recommend them
(I also like how the right side is longer than the left--makes it world's easier to figure out which is which in poor lighting)
Bought this as a gift and my brother loves it
I tried using it once, and the sound quality was more than acceptable: well-rounded with the response leaning slightly toward being bass-heavy
Im a pro A/V Installer so im used to comparing speakers and headphones for sound quality on a daily basis
These things are awesome in the sound quality category
If you're looking for something to listen to crystal clear audio with great bass response these are amazing for the price
The huge drawback is no audio controls or built in microphone
So not very good for phone calls
My Previous Review is below
Since then the head phone jack ripped when I tried to take it out of my phone
(I Always pull the jack out base as close to the end as possible
) I had to use plyers to get the metal piece out of the audio port
Started out good then went down hill
I purchased these for when I workout- Run/WeightsThey are a little uncomfortable
The suction created when putting them in you ears causes a little discomfort
The sound is decent but could be better
I think that these are good for the price I bought them at but I would defiantly not recommend buying them full price
I have had some skull candy ear phones of the same style and I would rank these just above those
This is what I think is better about each one
Sennheiser- Sound, Size, Price(with Discount)Skull Candy-Comfort-ability, ear piece accessories
This is my second pair of these headphones
I really like the fit and the general feel and sound qualit, but my first pair broke after a year
I am hoping that this pair lasts better
I bought these earphones to use so that I wouldn't have to wear my headphones when walking around, working out or in the library
I recieved these earphones today, and have worn them for the past 6 hours with no discomfort
They have exceptional sound quality - far superior to any earphones I have had before, for a price that's extremely reasonable
I would recommend to anyone
Outstanding sound quality and they are not cheapos
I use these when i work out and they do the job well
I recommend them
The BEST earphones on the market
My old pair finally stopped working so I bought the exact same earphones again because they are so good
Cords are too thin and eventually fail
Using these in my office, they lasted about 4 months before I started getting static/loose connection then eventually one of the earbuds died
Also the asymmetrical earbud cords are annoying and end up causing one of the cords to always be tugging
These headphones are great for the price
The best I've listened to in this price range
The bass isn't very strong or thumpy despite the "enhanced bass" label
had them for 4 years now
they get tangled like all do, but quality physically and aurally is superb
totally
I tore the packaging open as soon as I got it, and I was amazed by the sound
I bought these to replace my a-JAYS, and these do the job perfectly
At the price they are now, there is no reason not to pick them up even as a spare
I personally spent a lot of time reading the reviews here, so I made sure to make sure this review is as detailed as possible
I apologize if it sometimes seems tangential and disconnected; I've been up slightly too long to write coherently
[Sound]The sound is so well balanced that I don't even bother using an EQ
Nor did I bother to do a "burn-in
" I listen to many genres, and haven't been disappointed at any point
Today I've been partial to rap, and I'm shocked my the bass response in these
For most of the day, and especially early in the morning, I have these on the very first volume level on my HTC One
With my a-JAYS, I was at 50-75% most of the time
[Isolation]They also have an appreciable amount of isolation ability (blocking out sounds in the environment), which makes the listening experience even more intimate
Though I'm not writing anything, I still have my CX 300B in just to clear my head and block the random ambient sounds in my room (computer fans, keyboard, rustling, etc
)[Exercise]These are perfectly fine for lifting and body exercises
When I tested these while running, they quickly fell out as I expected them to, but the unorthodox cable length allows for many different ways to wear them
I'm going to test some of these tomorrow and will update this post with my results
[Packaging]The packaging was plenty tough to survive shipping, but I opened it in seconds with a pocket knife
[Accessories]The headphones came with several size ear tips, but I quickly switched to the Small ear tips that came with my a-JAYS
There are sizes for each ear, but not nearly as many as the veritable collection that JAYS provides
The carrying case is very convenient and well-sized
The magnetic closing mechanism makes me much more inclined to store these safely, as it saves a lot of time that would be wasted zipping and unzipping
The "pouch" easily fits into my pocket, and seems like it will survive much longer than the lifetime of these headphones
[Physical Features]These have a long cable, so it should be a comfortable fit for tall people and a boon for those planning to exercise with them
And as a random observation, because I'm sure you're truly interested if you've read thus far, the L shaped plug seems very sturdy and should give some added protection to the cable
This is a design I really liked in my a-JAYS, so I'm glad these had that feature
Beyond that, these headphones have a clean, aesthetically pleasing look that really compliments my HTC One
[Caveats]As a note, here are some things to take into consideration:- I am not an Audiophile
I like to stay in the < $100 range
- I've only had these for a weekend now
Plays songs very clearly and the design of having the right earphone wrapped around my neck is good for preventing my earphones from getting tangled
when I am not using them
They are good for the price ($24 on Black Friday) especially since some of the earphones that are similar to this one are like $50
These earbuds have exceptional audio and bass unfortunately I can not judge there durability since upon one day of having them my dog destroyed them
Got fed up with these went through 3 pairs of these all the same problem one of the earbuds stop working
To top it off amazon doesn't offer the 2 year warranty
I've had these for about a year and let me say they sound AMAZING
They may not be over the ear headphones but for $35 (The price I got them for) they're great
I'm no audiophile but they sound better than the Apple Earpods they deliver great bass on my Nokia Lumia 1020 and the highs are crisp while listening to lossless audio
Overall great for the price must buy if you need a good pair of earphones at this price range
Some tips would be to let them burn in once you get them for about 48 hours also THE RIGHT EARBUD CHORD IS LONGER THAN THE LEFT
It throws everyone off when they buy it so consider yourself warned it is supposed to wrap around your neck and I think its a great idea and nicely implemented
Final tip is buy extra rubber tips for the ear buds you will most likely lose them as they fall off very easily and replacements are easy to find here on amazon for less than $5 you can get a 3 pack
Thanks for reading this review I hope you found it helpful
I didn't get these headphones for very long ,but I loved them while I had them
The sound was good in all departments
The bass was there but not boomy but controlled
The only problem I had was the fact that one side's cable length was 3x the size the other sides
I looked it up ,and it turns out that the big difference in length is because it should wrap around your neck
The sound was amazing and these earbuds are very small
The earbuds are not a bother in your ear ,and they don't come out easily
I found this to be nice and could sleep with these if I wanted to
Overall these headphones are up to par with earbuds in the $100 range
These have the same sound as my UrBeats with more controlled bass
excellent sound , nice bass and crispi highs , beautiful price i am really happy whit this porchase realy happy
Excellent
Ive been in the market for a set of ear buds for a little while now
The other ear buds I had were the ones that came with my galaxy S3
Those sounded Ok at best ( too harsh to my ears) and got uncomfortable after a short time
IMHO, these were worth the $40 price without question
Mids, highs, and lows are very well done and clean
No harshness and easy on the ears
very clear
In regards to Bass
It depends on the type of listener you are
If you like tight, punchy and accurate bass,  these are a winner
If you are a bass head and like the deep, sloppy, rumbling type bass
they will disappoint
Ive seen many complain about the cord length, The right is longer than the left
but personally, I really like this
If put in the left bud, and put the right buds cord around the back of your neck it works out wonderful
If you are listening to something and someone speaks to you you can pull the right bud and it just drapes over your right shoulder rather than hanging down to the floor
As I said, I really like it and find it a nice design thought
But it may be a con for some
There's really not much to say
Excellent product at the price point
I am very happy with them
But, to be totally fair here, Ive always been a big Sennheiser fan
Even my over the ear cans are Sennheisers
So there may be a bit bias :)
These headphones are amazing for the price
At first right out of the box they sound clear and crisp already, did some burning and now they sound phenomenal
Fit for bassheads or audiophiles, or atleast you wont be disappointed, the highs are amazing, mids are great and the bass is not overpowered like the JVC extreme explosives and still boomy, which is superbbb
The asymmetrical cable isn't really that great but it's irrelevant if you're only using these for daily use, commuting etc
I personally don't really like the ear tips so I gave the JVC extreme explosives' ear tips a try and I noticed some changes in the isolation and bass, man I fell in love with them even more
Definitely a huge step up from Apple's 2nd gen Earbuds or pods
Great sounding headphones, and I love the extra long cable
Only thing missing is inline volume control/microphone, which I understood going into it
All in all I would buy them again
These are great earbuds
I replaced a pair of Jlabs with these, and they were absolutely worth the extra money
I'm not much of an audiophile, but the range on these seems very good
Bass was definitely well represented, and the highs that were in my hearing spectrum were crisp
Just keep your expectations realistic
You won't get near the sound quality that you will out of a decent pair of open over the ear Sennheiser's
For me, they serve the exact purpose that I wanted them for
Decent sound quality, while blocking out extraneous sound
They allow me to tune everything else out except for music and work
The bass is really nice and has a good fit to it
also comes with a nice little case for it which i thought was neat
:D
You can't get better sound for $25
00 anywhere
Crisp highs, and booming bass
My only complaint is that the cord coming out of the "Y" is very short going to the left ear, while the cord going to the right ear out of the "Y" is very long
Not sure if it's supposed to be like this, or I just got a funky pair
Will update my review on their longevity later if I remember ;)
For less than $20 the sound is great
The cable is thin but the overall construction is really good for something so cheap
As I lost this things all the time and the cat that lives in my apartment love to eat wires, this earphone is a very good option
If you want a very affordable earphone with a good sound quality, this is the right one for you
I like these for the sound, but really don't like that one of the cords is shorter than the other
I didn't realize the left and right cords would be different lengths when i purchased these, and surprised how much shorter the left ear cord would be so be aware of this if you are considering these
Its too bad that Sennheiser doesn't make a model like this with normal length cords for the left and right sides
I originally got these for my son, who liked the sound but hated the left cord length issue, so I ended up using them myself since I like the sound and just dealing with the one cord being shorter than the other
Stay away from this product
Everything negative written about it turns out to be true
The ear-buds continuously fall out, and yes, we tried all sizes
The asymmetric cable - Worst design decision ever
This design causes slack cable to slap you on the face or tangle in your clothing
Also, because of the tension on side of the ear - they tend to fall off
The cable - It tangles so badlyI made a mistake buying those, didn't read the reviews before I bought it and was under pressure because I lost my klipsche
Never again
This is a good earphone in this price range
I wish people would stop complaining about the sound quality, you get what you pay for
If you want amazing sound, go spend $500 on a pair of earphones
These are well made and they are still going strong after 2 years of use
Good bass and overall sound quality for the price
Sennheiser makes my favorite ear buds
Everyone should know that the left bud is much shorter than the right in this particular set of buds
I sent the first one back thinking it was defective
I actually see the benefit in having the left ear bud shorter now
I use earbuds to listen to news and talk radio podcasts (yes, the Left does have excellent podcasts)
I use them probably 5 hours a day working in the house or yard
My previous buds wore out from putting the post in and out of my phone (the post quit)
Immediately impressed with the sound quality and noise canceling ability of these ear buds
No long term data as yet but will include in next six months
These ear buds have amazing quality
Even though the quality is very good, I wouldn't ever purchase these again
They work great for a while, but then one ear bud always dies
This usually happens every 3-5 months
I've replaced these 3 times and now it broke again
It does have a 2 year warranty and the company fixes them with no questions asked
You do have to pay for shipping to get it there (which ended up costing more than the headphones themselves)
Basically, if you don't mind owning these for 4 months and having to send them in for repair multiple times over the next 2 years, go for it
I know I will never buy these headphones again
I am also leery of purchasing anything from them at all
UPDATE: I Contacted Sennheiser USA to let them know the issue with these headphones (breaking every 3-5 months
They were kind enough to send me another set of higher quality headphones for free to fix my displeasure
This company went far out of their way to make things right
Will definitely purchase another product from Sennheiser down the road, just not this particular model

I rarely review products, but feel the need to say 'these are awesome'
I am by no means an audiophile, but find the tonal qualities of these 'phones  much better than the V-Moda's they are replacing
I listen to music all day while working and need something that is comfortable to have in for an extended period
I can take these out at the end of the day and my ears are not sore at all
5 stars
great quality sound but I do not like the asymmetrical cables
I got these on sale and am content with the purchase but these would be 5/5 if they had equal cable lengths and maybe had a microphone to answer calls with
I have several earbuds, from the inexpensive, to mid-price to higher price (Etymotic ER6i), and these are definitely the best that I've owned -- especially for the price
When you use the proper earbud size, the noice isolation is very good, the highs are crisp and clear and the base response is excellent
I highly recommend these
Had them for a few weeks and they sound real good
My wife has some Sony ear buds and the sound is not as crisp and full
I would like the cord to be flat instead of round less tangels
Cant go wrong for the price
This was a horrible purchase the cords are not the same length
so if you are only wearing a left arm band for your device it doesnt work well
the right ear bud is twice as long as the left
which makes it supremely ackward to have the cords in front of you
ridiculous
And of course THEY DON"T WARN YOU OF THIS
UGHHHHHHHHH
The Sound is perfect but they are designed to your phone rather than for your computer, sometimes in my laptop when i'm using Skype or listening to music in bed it looses the sound with the movement
If you is other device like phones mp3 or something similar the sound is perfect, you can be isolated easily
Comfortable and good quality
Here's a list of reasons why I dislike these ear phones:-tons of cord noise, slightest movement sounds like 50mph winds knocking the cord around-tons of cord noise means extremely limited useable situations, which means do not even think about using them for running
-not expensive, but not worth the money
I may not be an audiophile but I would say these aren't even better than stock Apple earbuds
They excel in some, very few respects but lack greatly in other, namely the bass which is almost non-existent on these earphones
That's about it, I don't expect the world for the price I paid but I'm certain I've purchased better earphones for cheaper from Sony and other brands
These earbuds are wonderful quality for the price
I had just purchased a pair of Skullcandy Ink'd 2
0 buds when I discovered these
After I bought this pair of earbuds and compared them to the Skullcandy version, I realized just how much better these where
I payed twice what I did for the Skullcandy earbuds to get these, but the quality is just about twice as good so it's worth it
I highly recommend them
I expected more bass based on the fact that the product title states "Enhanced Bass"
The "highs" are too strong
They could be more balanced
it is a little bit expensive than the CX200, not too much improvement
maybe next time i ll choose the CX200, much cheaper and sounds the same
Clear sound, clean, tight bass
I like these because the have a balanced sound and they're not bass heavy like most earbuds you find nowadays
Accurate reproduction of the music EQ
Seriously great sounding earbuds for the price
The sound is really great, and they cancel out a lot of noise
I use them to listen to music while I play drums along to it
The asymmetrical cord isn't too big of a problem, but it can get frustrating when you try to coil them up or wear them with the cord coming down the right side instead of the left
The right angle plug feels sturdy, and the little bag they include is pretty useful for me, because I carry them in my backpack instead of my pockets
Keeps them separated and relatively tangle-free
I'd recommend these to anyone that's still using the earbuds that came with their phone/iPod, because these are leagues ahead of them, at a price that is incredible for what you get
Don't be fooled by the low price - they're highly discounted for a reason
The cord tangles and gets caught on everything
The sound is very "tinny" and high-pitched
The only good thing about these is that they cancel some outside noise, and the bass is decent
But you can do much better
Stay away
I'm not an audiophile so I cannot explain in technical details but I can assure that these are very good earphone
Puts out great bass as described and the sound quality is better than my Apple earbuds
Earbuds fits my medium sized ear canal like a glove
Get what you pay for with these
They are nothing special
The sound is OK
The fit isn't bad actually and you only get a few tips (SML)
The noise cancelling/isolation is only so so though
As in I can still hear my co-workers
The wires are very thin and round, and one is longer than the other so it doesn't hang symmetrical
It also means that they knot up very easily and one likes to hit you in the face since they are so light which is very frustrating
Coming from some more expensive JLABs that died out from a little over a year of hard usage, these are definitely sub par in just about every way possible
pretty good sound for a cheap pair of buds
just wish the buds were a little small but sounds good
cant wait to see how the sound on the plane
Great-sounding earbuds from a company that always produces quality products
The asymmetrical cords take a little getting used to, but once you do, you appreciate how the cord hangs away from the center of your chest
The uneven wire length of earbuds is a bit weird
I knew what I was buying but I wasn't sure if I like it
It's not bad but if I wouldn't buy it again
Wrapping it around my palm is a bit weird :) Sound quality is OK, but I am not fancy listener, I won't feel much difference with a pair of $10 in-ears from Chinatown, hence I don't buy $100+ headphones, I won't feel it and they will die within a year like any other cheaper ones so why bother
So far, they work well, if anything happens I will update later
Edit Jan 13: 2014
Well, that didn't last long
Apparently, those are not as resilient as I expected
One ear started to sound a lot quieter than the other
It's not dead yet and there is no crackling noise of the broken cable but the level of the sound in one ear is very low, it's almost like you listening on one side
The only way to hear the other ear is to remove the loud one
Otherwise it feels like it's dead
Will try to replace it on warranty
Too bad my old CX475 died, I wold love to have those again
Knocking off the star
I didn't even use them that heavily :(
The reason I got these was because my brother had them and they where amazing, I had to get another one with in a week because I broke my first pair but I was totally willing to pay for the other pair, that's mow much I love these
They have great bass, and over all I love how snug they fit in my ear
These ear buds are amazing
I do not know why and don't know why my earbuds just turned out to be a 3 feet long caompatible cable
I think it's the best earphones I can buy within $30
The bass is quite good
If you like Rock and don't want to spend too much, buy this one, no regret
I love the sound out of these earbuds
I think the sound could not possibly be any better
looks durable, and wear under my helmet with a mp3 player
cuts wind noie and music is great for long rides,I will buy this again, if I lose them
It may be "pilot error" but I had wind noise in these ear buds when I tried them
The transmit good sound but the breeze whistling was distracting
Could be I did not use them properly as this was my first pair
Great HeadphonesReally good sound quality for a great price
thanks and good luck to all of you who are looking to buy
Failed to meet my expectations, did not like the way it is made to go around the neck or however it is designed
Unbelievable, these ear buds are fantastic
I'll be buying another set very soon for a spare
can't say enough about them
Expected to much because it is from Sennheisers but for the price it was not worth it and is equivalent to 20$ earphones
Bass is good I guess, over all an "okay" headphone
Have used these for a decade
Old pair was fine
Found this on amazon and couldn't resist
These cords really dont tangle like other earbuds I've had
Sound is flawless
Fit is the best
Thanks for keeping your qualityHerr Sennheiser
Great EarbudsThese are the only earbuds I have found that are comfortable enough to sleep with
Sound quality is also very good
OMG, why didn't I buy this before
Insanely rich and full sound
From a pair headphones that cost only $34
00
I can't just believe it
I use them mostly with Pandora One on an iPhone 5s
They sound sooooooooooooooooooooo much better than anything I've put in my ears at this range
They sound like $300
00 headphones
Apple Pods are not even close this
Crystal clear, rich full sound
Super loud, ( had to lower the volume 2 clicks ) compared to Apple's Pods
Just WOW
The best buy for the money in a long long time
These are the most comfortable earbuds I've ever tried
The sound quality is great
The cord seems to be coated in a nice rubbery material that won't crack and split over time
this is the second pair of these I have owned
I gave the first ones to my daughter
The fit with the options make these very comfortable
Sound quality is better than buds costing a lot more,  Would buy all over again
they suffice
i still can't get used to things staying in my ears
sound seemed normal to me
they are better than basic earbuds, though
if you're willing, however, go ahead and splurge on a nicer pair of earbuds/headphones
We compared the sound to our old Sony earbuds and there was a big difference
This is a great product and the bass is truly outstanding
I would say the headphones are okay and more or less worth the price you pay for them
I, for one, was a little disappointed by the bass effect of my headphones
Honestly, I was expecting a lot more from my headphones as all the previous headphones I've owned in this price range have been way better when it comes to bass and trebble performance
The sound quality is pretty good though
If you are looking for headphones within the price range $30-40, you should probably go for this model
I bought these almost three months ago to replace a set of Sennheiser earbuds that had finally broken after more than three years of use and abuse; that model is now discontinued
I ordered these thinking they were the 'next generation' of earbuds, and while the sound and fit are fine, the end that plugs into the jack on your computer/phone/whatever is extremely poorly attached
There is a one-piece L-type joint that is the housing for the jack connection, but it was rather loose when I received them, and it is vary precariously together now
I think that there is probably just the wire holding the jack through the L-joint, and I expect that it will break in the near future
These are nowhere near as durable as my previous Sennheisers, and I'm quite disappointed
I don't recommend buying these if you are going to insert and remove them from devices often
Update (Nov 13, 2013): As of yesterday evening, these are no longer working; I assume it is due to wires breaking in the poorly attached jack joint
Again, DON'T buy these if you plan on inserting and removing them from devices (such as phones) often
One of the earbuds stopped working within the first few times I wore them
Sennheiser makes these with one earbud about twice as long as the other causing it to be awkward to wear
Also, the earbuds don't stay in your ears because of the way they are designed
Junk
The sound is ok
Not brilliant and the earpiece is too big for my ears
Hurts after an hour of use
I listen to music all day at work
So these weren't for me
I bought a pair of Sennheiser CX 300B MK II in the beginning of 2012
I loved the quality of the sound
Nice base, loud and clear sound, convenient storage pouch
Recently (Oct 2013) the plug started to rip and I decided to purchase another pair of the same headphones since I was so happy with my first ones
I was unpleasantly surprised by the my second pair
I compared both sets on the same track and the quality was significantly inferior on the new ones
Low sound and poor base were my main complaints
The pouch would also not close completely and was made by low quality materials
I am not sure if this was just a poor quality batch I got or the company decided to cut costs by using low quality materials
With that said I don't think I will be buying that brand again
A consumer is normally looking for consistent quality regardless weather he is buying a loaf of bread or a TV
I did not get the quality I was used to
I am in love
That is all I have to say about this product
I own the BOSE Quiet Comfort Q15 earphones, which are too big and cumbersome for the gym, so I decided to order the Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds
I cannot believe the music quality coming out of my ears
And that bass
I am very pleased

I am very pleased
I brought this expecting great bass sound and got NONE
The sound is crisp & loud but the bass is practically non-existent -- why
The artist creates their music the way THEY want it to sound and Sennheiser obviously decides "no, we don't like bass level, take it as low as possible
"  I swear if I hadn't tossed away all the packaging, I would return these ASAP
Next pair will be Bose, I own 3 sets of their speakers and I know their headphones will be as great
I usually use BOSE in ear buds and decided to try save some cash and these did not really do it - ended up buying BOSE again
Dont really fit well in my ear - Not a fan of the asymmetrical cords either
Sound quality was decent if you stuff it far enough down your ear
I am using the earbuds as I writing this review
Great sound for good price
I have only used it for about a month now so we'll see how long the quality will last
I like the earbuds very much, but only one set of ear protectors was in the package, which states it contains multiple sets of them
better than i expected, only think i didnt like was that one headphone cord is alot shorter than the other one
other than that great buy
I wasn't looking for acoustic perfection in a pair of earbuds that cost $30
I wanted headphones that sounded decent, that would be durable enough to hold up in my backpack, and get me through school
These seem to fit the bill so far
When I first popped them in, I thought they were a little bass-heavy (I know that companies sometimes boost the bass to impress less discerning ears), but I've gotten used to them
The clarity and precision isn't superb, but like I said, that's not what I was looking for this time
I was glad to see the different size adapters and after figuring out which ones fit best, I find I can wear these buds for hours and hardly notice they're there
Very comfortable
The sound isolation was a little better when I had the bigger size adapters on, but I found them to be a little uncomfortable over time, so I opted for the medium size in favor of the comfort
The pouch might be small thing for some, but I'm really glad to have it
Works great to keep these things from getting tangled up in my backpack
The asymmetrical cord was strange to me at first, but I really like it now
It's a nice feature when you put the right-side-cord behind your neck and only have the left side going down to your audio device
Overall, if you're like me and are tired of your cheap headphones that fall apart after a couple months in a backpack, these will be perfect for you
They're definitely worth the amazon price of 30 bucks
Hats off to Ted S and his November 17, 2011 Review of these cans
Ted has forgotten more than I know and his review was spot on
Thanks for such a thorough and accurate review
I have thoroughly enjoyed these ear buds
The sound quality is stunning and I own 7 buds
Simply put, I love them
I've been looking for a pair of cheaper earphones to stick in my gym bag and take to workouts
Several other models that I bought suffered greatly from problems brought on by cheap construction -- an irregularly sized connection plug on one, very tinny sound for more than one, annoying electronic buzzing with movement of the cord, etc
I should have started my search with Sennheiser
This earphone provides nice sound in a sturdy design
No buzzing
Decent highs and lows
These are not symphony hall quality phones, of course, but the sound and the range of the sound is just fine for casual listening
The only surprise was that the cords are asymmetrically set, so that the wire to the earbud on one side is significantly shorter than the wire to the other earbud
This makes it easy to use the phones connected to a player device clipped or strapped to an arm or on a side of the body, and the design provides less flapping wire on that side
The phones also come with a small pouch that makes them easy to transport
For the price, these earphones provide a really decent sound and no problems
I guess I was expecting more from Sennheiser having owned some of their higher end cans for my work so i was a little let down that they just sound like a decent set of ear buds
To be fair I have never heard a set of ear buds that impress me
They are either decent with nice all around sound or crappy which means tinny with a lot of buzz or overly muddy to fake bass response, but none of them are going to inspire awe in someone who works with audio on a regular basis
So really what I think is important when it comes to buds is comfort and the Senns win big points there
They come with 3 sets of gummies for different sized ears and once you figure out which pair you like they fit and stay in very nicely with no pain after 5-6 hours
I even wear them to bed and lay on my side
My wife has tiny ears and she typically hates ear buds but she looked genuinely surprised when she popped these in and said they were comfortable
I kinda like the way one ears cord is slightly shorter than the other, not only does it help them stay untangled but it makes knowing right from left really easy at a glance or even a quick feel in the dark
I bought a separate case for them that allows me to wrap the cord around a center spindle
the included bag is kind of a joke but to be honest I haven't really given it a try
Overall I'm pretty happy with them, I just needed something for my tablet when I'm watching movies in a quiet room or on a plane and these do the job nicely
The sound is on par with other good pairs of ear buds, I have no complaints about them at all
Like I said, with the Sennheiser name I was expecting to be blown away but really they're just a good set of buds
So to sum em up:Good soundVery comfortable and customizable with 3 sets of plugsDon't tangle easilyCarrying case included
I can't really think of any negatives
I use them daily and like em a lot
They're not my Open Ear, Circum Aural HD's but they are a solid pair of comfortable ear buds, they stay in, deliver good sound and don't hurt my ears
No problems with them so far and they've seen a lot of use so the build quality seems pretty sturdy
Good buy
For earbuds, these work well
The bass is just okay, but these ARE earbuds, not around-the-ear headphones
I don't care much for the different lengths of cable on each bud because it puts too much pressure on the shorter piece
(Not an audiophile, but I am someone who appreciates crisp clear audio and punchy, but non-overpowering, bass
)For this price point, these headphones are awesome
I have bought two pairs
These headphones produce extremely clean clear audio
The bass is not overpowering but very neat and punchy
I have heard song details with these headphones that I have never heard before
Exercise:  I have used these for working out (weight training)
They are excellent and stay in well
I do not know how they do for running
If you sweat a lot, you will want to wear these on top of an undershirt in order to prevent water damage from the sweat
Note 1:  For best results, you will want the ear buds to be fully inserted (and isolated) into the ear ways
This produces best bass and sound
But this may be unsafe for driving or walking in crowds, traffic, etc
--------Review Edit (14 January 2013):  Durability is questionable
Recently the plug on my headphones came apart :(  The L-shaped plug is useful -- but due to its shape, it seems that it is vulnerable to wear
In particular, the rubber covering of my plug detached from the metal connector and severed the wires inside
These things sound great, especially when you consider the price
Great value
Plenty of low frequency thump, yet they still sound very clear and precise, due to having plenty of high and mid-high frequency output
Basically, you hear all the detail you could want to hear
I have a set of Skullcandy Titan earbuds, similarly priced, with a larger driver, and they put out a little more bass, but they sound a lot muddier, because they have little in the way of high frequency output
By the way, don't buy bass enhanced earbuds for use with a headphone amp on an electric bass guitar
Totally unnecessary
I didn't realize that one of the heaphones was suppose to be smaller then the other until I read in on the details behind the design of the headphones
Other then that, I'm pleased with the sound quality, I hope they last me a very long while
Having one earbud have a longer cord than the other is a pain
Great sound quality though, I probably wouldn't buy these again though
These earbuds are great
I can't say enough good things about them
Let me see where to start, I primarily use them with my Samsung Galaxy Note 2
I downloaded a Equalizer application to the phone made by Smart Android Apps LLC that works really well, and for my MP3 player I am currently using PlayerPro Music Player
I will not go into the technical specs on the earbuds because I'm sure you can see that in another review
Instead let me tell you about the sound of the music
I listened to different kinds of music that I have loaded on my memory card (64GB and at this writing over 6,000 song of different genera) and also streaming music
They sound equally good when listening to Jimi Hendrix, Pantara or Sevendust
I tried them with Aretha Franklin, Anita Baker, Eva Cassidy, Kenny Loggins and Alice Russell to great satisfaction
In listening to Teddy Pendergrass, Kurt Elling, Take 6 and Anointed I was just blown away
But, what a pleasure to listen to B
B
King, Buddy Guy, Michael Bloomfield and Bobby 'Blue' Bland
You can listen to the Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jeff Beck, Carlos Santana, and Allan Holdsworth and not be disappointed in the least
Pandora streaming service sounds really good
My wife ask must I ware them 24 hours a day, and as a matter of fact they are so comfortable I forget I have them on
Of course I told her yes, as I am currently streaming on Tunein Radio "This American Life 24/7" (smile)
And yes they sound great
As I said in the beginning of this review, I just can not say enough good thing about my satisfaction with these earbuds
I highly recommend them for the great sound and the price can''t be beat
Oh, I let my 21 year old daughter listen to them, and she said "I don't know why they came out with the Beats by Dre"
So far so good
Clear sound without overpowering or hurting my ear
Base sound is esp good for an ear bud
Chord has rubbery feel to it
I'm actually pleasantly surprise with this earbud
Definitely worth the try
I rarely review products, but feel the need to say 'these are awesome'
I am by no means an audiophile, but find the tonal qualities of these 'phones  much better than the V-Moda's they are replacing
I listen to music all day while working and need something that is comfortable to have in for an extended period
I can take these out at the end of the day and my ears are not sore at all
5 stars
great quality sound but I do not like the asymmetrical cables
I got these on sale and am content with the purchase but these would be 5/5 if they had equal cable lengths and maybe had a microphone to answer calls with
These ear buds are the best ones that I've used within this price range
I actually like the uneven length of the cord so that it goes behind your head
Some do not like that, but it's practical when you don't want a dangling cord in your way if you are doing something that involves a lot of moving about or moving your arms
The sound quality is fantastic
Sure, it's not as good as the really high end headphones, but it's more than you could possibly ask for at this price
The noise reduction is also extremely effective
I used this while riding on lawnmower, and it was astounding how well I could hear my music and how much it drowned out the mower
I've had this for over a year and a half, and I do not plan on looking for a new one anytime soon
It's also really good for running
I've had problems in the past with ear buds falling out, but this one stays right in place
I do not think the bass is too excessive, and I listen to a variety of music from electronic to classical stuff and these headphones capture everything that I could hope to hear
I always recommend these to whoever is looking for a set of ear buds
If I ever need a new pair in the future (like if someone stole mine because they're so awesome), then I would undoubtedly buy the same exact pair
Pretty dece, they block out sound, and sound dece for an earbud
Would buy again if I lost them
I originally demo'd them at skate city, and they completely blocked out the 2-chainz song, so that sold me
The headphones are comfortable and have nice sound quality (although I  am not an audiophile )
My only complaint is they were a little uncomfortable to sleep with
Excellent sound for the price
Love that they came with a small pouch to store them in
I love them
Cheap knockoffs, Sounds terrible
My $20 Skullcandy's are better sounding than these
Would never ever recommend to anyone ever Period
I was actually surprised by the sound quallity these had
I was effy on having an asymmetrical cord but now that I hav tried it I probably wont go back to regular cords
Theses are the best earbuds for the price
it is a good product with a useful bagit grants good soundsmall problem: wires tend to wind up
Think of the cheapest pair of Panasonic earbuds out there, dress them up in a Sennheiser box and charge through the nose for them
That is what you will get
I did not send them back because I had already destroyed the box and it wasnt worth my time
I have down time, hence the review
Amazon, please remove this particular product
I am sure the authentic product is great
The pair I received were noticeable knock offs; they even rattled when you shook them
I love these things
They fit well, sound as good as anything else I've tried, even the horribly priced BEATS and Bose brands
I'm a huge fan and now own three other pair of Senheiser's
The enhanced bass isnt as good as I was hoping for, the sport buds made for Adidas by Senheiser definitely beat these
But again for the price, the sound is awesome
Great product
Made in Germany
Very little, nice bass and clear sound
Use them at work and at the gym
Still going strong
The reason I got these was because my brother had them and they where amazing, I had to get another one with in a week because I broke my first pair but I was totally willing to pay for the other pair, that's mow much I love these
They have great bass, and over all I love how snug they fit in my ear
These ear buds are amazing
I do not know why and don't know why my earbuds just turned out to be a 3 feet long caompatible cable
great product for the price
The are not as good as the Bose that i previously had but the definitely do not have the price tag either
I would recommend this product
I got these a few weeks ago, and I love these earbuds
I have really small ears (I can't even jam in the standard Apple earbuds), and the smallest set of earbud covers fits into my ear canal perfectly
They have great sound and significant passive noise reduction, even without anything playing
They're so comfortable I find excuses to put them in my ears even if I wouldn't normally want to listen to something
Great value, would definitely buy again
One ear bud was shorter than the other so fit wasn't correct
As for any noticeable bass it just wasn't there
I noticed on other posts there are counterfeit Sennheiser out there, I'm betting I got just that
Really brought down my thoughts about buying anything on Amazon
Outstanding quality
They rival the sound of my beats ear buds
For those who are more particular, you should be aware that the wiring is in the shape of a U (one ear cord is long than the other) not the typical V wire structure
I've found it actually works great for running because you can have the cord go behind your neck, not under your chin
This avoid having the cord jumping around uncomfortably
I just purchased these for only $30 and I really love the sound quality, though the description says "Precision Enhanced Bass", the bass is not overwhelming or muffled
It is very crisp and overall  a very nice feature
I love the clarity too, it sounds like over the ear headphones but compacted down into a nicely fitting earbud
So glad I purchased it, would recommend to others or as a gift
I have a pair of over-the-ears Sennheiser headphones, and the quality and comfort of those is excellent, perfect really
So when it came down to choosing between these Sennheiser earbuds or another company for a similiar price, I went ahead and went with the company I knew and had a good product from
It was not what I expected, however
I gave these earbuds 3 stars for the simple fact that they work; there's nothing particularly dysfunctional about them
But I'm a bit of an audiophile, so the first thing I noticed was that the sound quality was somewhat muffled and flat
I figured maybe it was just me being picky, so I gave it some time to see if it would "go away"
It has not
Further, even though these are advertised as having excellent bass production, it's not actually that spectular; it's just "above average"
The flatness in tone I mentioned is mostly in mid to high tones
The second thing I don't particularly like about these earbuds (and this might just be me), but they're rather small and shapeless
This is a problem for a few reasons: first, I'm a tall guy, with big long fingers, so removing earbuds like this becomes something just short of a surgical procedure
And if you're wearing gloves when one of the buds comes out
Forget about putting it back in with the glove on
Further, becasue they're so small and shapeless, there's nothing, other than the silicon "cup" around the speaker, that holds the earbud in place, which means sometimes it can slide around and get uncomfortable
On a more personal note from experience: these earbuds tend to be rather "middle of the road" in quality
My first good earbuds were from Sony for $60 (I think they're since discontinued); AWESOME sound quality, had extra large bass drivers, fit snuggly against the back of the earlobe
Only reason I'm not using them much anymore is because I busted them up pretty bad
but even my Samsung brand earphones that came with my Galaxy S4 are better than these Sennheiser's
The Samsung's lack deeper bass production, but make up for it with a comfortable shape and excellent mid and high tone production
The latest version of Apple's iPod / iPhone earbuds aren't bad
excellent tonal range and quality, slightly better shape and comfort, but still lack good bass and snug fit
The problem is not with the Sennheiser ear phones, which are actually an outstanding product
The problem is that the supplier selling these through the Amazon site is selling refurbished and defective product
The first one I received came in with ear buds that were 1 foot difference in length
Seemingly, a quality control issue
Thinking it couldn't happen again, I reordered and received an obviouly repackaged product with the exact same defect
Since they are selling through Amazon LLC, they are able to hide who they actually are, or the origin of the product
Unfortunatlely, Amazon, LLC is becoming a marketplace for more and more suppliers with dubious products
4 of the last 5 orders I have made through the Amazon site for an electronic product have arrived defective
Before these, I had Sennheiser $15 cheaper, and the sound quality was approximately the same
To compare, its cable looks more protected from rips
And, I believe, it is the only difference
These earbuds are perfect for my workout, they don't fall out
I have to admit Sennheiser always show the best durability and sound for the fair price
And it's the only company that gives guarantee for 2 years
Look up for it before you buy
Sounds good
Looks good
Everything is good
This is the first time for me using Sennheiser headset, it's out of my expectations
I was in search for new earbuds after my Panasonic $8 earbuds broke
I noticed that I use earbuds more often now for traveling and such so I was fine with spending a bit more money but not too much and found this
I can say that i'm very satisfied
I'm not a audiophile but the sound quality is the best I've tried out of the other brands
The Bass is very fresh, not too heavy but just right
The sounds are also all very clear, but it might be a bit too high
(Not really sure what to say)Material wise, this isnt the best but its alright
one thing I did like about it the length difference of the left and right
You wrap the right side over your neck so there isn't any cords handing in front of your face
Would recommend
It is waste money
do not recommend anyone buy it
I am so regret that I bought this headphone and waste money
These headphones are awesome
A much thicker, very noticeable bass sound coming from these earbuds especially in comparison to my old Sony earbuds
My new 37 dollar earbuds out perform my 150 dollar, over the ear Bose headphones
The difference is rather noticable
Shame on you Bose
The goofy cable seemed so stupid at first, I was pretty upset
But then I gave it a chance and I really learned to like the cable
I was eating lunch the other day while listening to my old headphones and the cable was getting caught in my fork
That will not happen with these because of the goofy cable
I am totally impressed
I am rather disappointed with these earbuds
I have been a long-time fan of Sennheiser products
I feel that the earbuds that came with my iPhone offer better dynamics and better bass delivery
I found the dynamic range of the Sennheiser earbuds to be extremely limited
I do not feel that the bass delivery lives up to the claim
Sent these back for a refund
Received a bad pair
The cords from the ear piece to where they join into one cord are of uneven length, the left ear bud was over 9 inches shorter than the right ear-bud
Only option was to refund not replace
So I can't judge on sound quality
When I first use it I could feel the very unbalanced volume between the left side and the right side: the right side obviously much louder than the left side
No any way to adjust it
I tried with my phone, my laptop, and my iPod - all have the same issue of unbalanced volume
Unfortunately I have destroy the plastic box in order to get the earphone out so that I will not be able to return this crap
PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS EARPHONE BECAUSE YOU WILL HURT YOUR EAR AND TOTALLY WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY
These earphones have lasted me longer than any earphone I have ever had
These also sound better than any earphone I have ever had
Great price too
Will definitely buy these same ones or a newer model if I ever need to
These are some very good ear buds it may just be me but the  tips aren't very suitable for the active lifestyle but it can be easily fixed with the use of the Comply T-400 Isolation Earphone Tips (Black, 3 Pairs, Medium)
My granddaughter asked for these for Christmas and she loved them when she received them
No complaints so it met her expectations
Quality of sound is phenomenal
The compromise of price and quality is as good as it gets
If you're interested in listening to recreational music with great quality, these are the headphones you need
First thing is first, when i pulled these out of their box
They felt/looked very cheap
The wire's felt like they could snap under the most minor pressure
Needless to say, I've gotten over that
These Ear buds defiantly crank out some serious sounds
I've been hearing instruments I've never heard before, In song's I've listened too a thousand times
There is always room for improvement, but for the price
These dominate
Would highly recommend
sound quality was adequatebuds were comfortable, able to wear for extended periodsone side quit working after only 6 month of relatively light use
Stored in case
Good product
The sound is  clear and I am happy with the product
The cord is very long but I like it that way
It is heavy duty and will probably last a long time
The speaker part is a little large and for those that have small ear holes this may be a problem
When something says "Enhanced Bass", you expect it to have good bass
This is the exact opposite
No matter what device I use these with, there is a distinct lack of bass
I'm not sure how I could be doing something wrong, they fit wonderfully and I love the full size headphones by Sennheiser, I guess I'm just expecting too much
Edit: it appears to be a problem in how I was wearing them
Slightly adjusting the position so they point higher in the ear made a tremendous difference
There is still the problem of cable noise on my Galaxy S4, but it isn't noticeable when used with my iPod or any of my computers
I hadn't found go-around-the-neck wire" earbuds for years
That was a suprise to me to find such high-quality earbud with such design
Also, the buds themselves and comfortable and very, very effective: they really kill the outer noise and provide clean bass frequencies
It's worth the price
Probably the best quality sound I've heard come out of earbuds in this price range
I would definitely recommend these
If you get a tight fit these really do have a full bass sound
They also have great separation and tonal clarity in the highs and mids
Great sound
Mid-range is vibrant
Vocals and piano sound real good
Comfortable ear buds
I would have given 5 stars but there was a minor flaw in the construction
The right ear bud's wire is 11" longer than the left
It doesn't affect anything, but looks weird
The best headphones I've ever owned
The price is great and the sound is even better
I would recommend to everyone
I bought these earbuds to replace my old Sennheiser CX300-B which finally died after a couple of years of hard use
I figured the new ones would be a good value, but didn't expect them to sound considerably better than the old version
You're not going to get better sounding earbuds at this price
Lasted less than two months before the right earbud stopped working, not surprising considering the wires are paper thin
Sound quality was nothing to write home about, just over priced earbuds that aren't built to last
:(I've had $5 bargin bin JVC earbuds that sounded just as good and lasted years
These sound great and have alot of bass but you have to make sure they are placed well into the ears
They have been a leader in the stereo headphone business for decades
Why would they not possess the same advantage in producing smaller earbuds
A fair price for an exceptional product
It's ok, judging by what everyone was saying I thought they would sound amazing, but to be honest my skullcandy fmj's sound betterEDIT: after you break them in they sound great
ALSO TO THE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CHORD LENGTH YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO PUT THE LONG SIDE AROUND THE BACK OF YOUR NECK, YOU LOOK REALLY DUMB IF YOU JUST LET IT HANG LIKE THAT
But yea great earphones for 30$
These sound really good, but I expected them to be louder due to their stated high efficiency
I am hard of hearing (I wear hearing aids) so I need buds to play loud without distorting
These are only just adequate
I bought these after reading good things about the brand; I wanted an upgrade from the earbuds that come standard with new iPods
I plugged them into my iPod, and there was no bass whatsoever
I realized that I had the EQ set to "Bass Reducer", so I switched around from EQ to EQ, hoping to improve the sound quality
Even on the EQ setting of "Bass Enhancer", there was still hardly any bass
I switched back and forth from the standard iPod earbuds, back to the Sennheiser ones, and back again
I couldn't believe the lack of sound quality coming from these ~$60 MSRP buds (granted I bought them on sale on Amazon for ~$30)
I even plugged them into different sources (Pandora playing on my phone, iTunes playing on my laptop), and still was completely disappointed with the sound quality
Needless to say, I will not be recommending this product to anyone
PRO: They work
CON: In my opinion, terrible sound quality
Also, the "asymmetrical" cord design is a pain and looks awkward
After being fed up with the quality of cheap earbuds, I sprung for a set of CX 300
I made sure that when I carry earbuds that I keep them in a pouch and use a Quirky Wrapster to keep them organized
I can't say much about sound, but it does deliver good bass and clarity than the previous ones I used
It blocks out a lot of noise, which helps with quality
I did use this during an airplane trip, and I can say it definitely reduced a lot of a droning cabin noise
Probably not as much as a dedicated noise-cancelling headset, but it's not enough for me to justify buying one
Just make sure to use the right ear adapters for the noise reduction to be effective
So far, the cables have not frayed yet, but I have been taking care of my earphones as best as I could by using the pouch and a small cable organizer
The rubber jacket surrounding the plug had split over the wire, but it doesn't interfere with its operation or quality
In fact, it might have helped make it more flexible
The asymmetric cabling annoys me, but it's no deal breaker
Amazing quality
There are not many earbuds that offer great sounds the way most headphones can
But these are definitely worth the price
The bass is good for earphones, and it makes listening to your ipod so much better
I was skeptical at first about the noise-cancelling portion of the description and the price
But I have to admit after a few days, these headphones were worth the price
Both earpieces fit perfectly in the ear canals and even at low volumes with the right music, the sounds block out the majority of the outside noises
This is perfect during rush hour in public transportation with noise around you
I would highly recommend to anyone who wants good quality headphones but do not want to give up an arm and a leg (i
e
Beats)
These headphones have spectacular sound quality for "ear buds
" Typically, bass is quite attenuated with small headphones and higher frequencies are too loud relative to the entire spectrum
The shape of the headphone with the rubber cover fits snugly within the outer ear and sufficiently masks external sound
If you find that you use earbuds with an iPhone or iPod all the time, spend a few dollars and buy these
Love these things
Lost my Skull Candy earbuds and decided to upgrade a bit when I replaced them
Very glad I did
Nothing wrong with my last pair, but the Sennheiser are absolutely amazing
Having always used headphones that either came with other products or that cost less than $10 I could never understand why people would rave about their far more expensive headphones
But after literally dozens of people recommended me Sennheiser earbuds I decided to give them a try
All I can say is WOW
To have earbuds that actually comfortably stay where they're supposed to, deliver tremendous bass, and don't distort voices is a combination that I didn't think was possible
And best of all they didn't cost an arm and a leg
There is no way I could be any happier with this product
I haven't tried a ton of earbuds, but I use Sennheiser studio headphones and mics and decided to give these a try before hearing them
Very pleased - good sound (not flat like the studio headphones, much better for general music listening), good isolation, bass is audible but not muddy or over emphasized
The asymmetrical cable can be a slight annoyance when jogging, but overall I'm very satisfied
I have owned many headphones over the years
But these remain my favorites
Good value for the money
NIce sound
VERY comfortable
And I like the "behind the neck" design with one chord shorter than the other
This is my 3rd pair
One died after over use
And now I have two so I can keep one in my car and the other travels with my on other trips
It is embarrassing to be seen in these earbuds because of the way the cord lays on your person
It looks like you yanked the right earbud out of place and are haplessly wearing your earbuds askew
To explain, the headphones have an asymmetrical "J" design resulting in two issues
1
The weight of the heavy tangle-free main cord is carried solely by your left earbud; resulting in an uncomfortable left earbud and a weightless right earbud
2
The cord to the right earbud, as others have said, is much too long
Resulting in a cord that makes loops across your chest and irritably runs across your neck to meet with the left main cable
A buddy recommended these to me - they're the highest quality earbud you can get for your money
The sound is great, decent noise cancellation and they're easy to take with you on long trips
Just great, not going to write about specs or anything, looking for the Best you will get it with these earbuds
I'm not a genius on headphones but these are far and away the best earbuds I've ever purchased
If you want to invest in some good ear buds, these are a good option
p
s
are better than my last pair dre tour beats(whichever were the ear bud beats, I can't remember)
Edit: Lasted 5 weeks, a tad disappointed, ill take off a star for that
I probably would choose something with better build quality if I were to use ear buds with things such as an ipod/mobile device
These would be perfect for a stationary device
Currently own some Sennheiser on-ear headphones and decided it was time I added some in-ear pair as well
I was not disappointed, great sound to be expected from a quality brand
Great sounding earbuds
These are my workout and lawn mowing earbuds
Still sound as great as they have when first purchased
If you like bass in your music, this is for you
The higher ends are a bit iffy though
Although they are Sennheiser, don't expect amazing quality from earbuds, its just impractical
But don't get me wrong, these are really fantastic, and they do fit pretty well
Great sound quality and noise reduction
You can take beat the price either
I find these seem to last longer than cheaper brands
I love these headphones
i wish the ear bud cords are adjustable as in both being the same length and one longer than the other
But other than that, it's awesome
These might seem to be mid-tier if you're only looking at the price, but they perform much better than many of the more expensive options out there
Cheaper to replace when you lose them too - about to buy another set
I chose these earbuds because of the experience I've had with other Sennheiser products, and not disappointed
It's hard to believe this quality of sound coming from earbuds, especially at this price point
The bass and mid are rich and full
the highs crisp and vibrant
When earbuds are wanted for truly portable sounds, these are the ones
Really solid headphones for the price, noise canceling, don't fall out when running
Only thing I dislike slightly is the asymmetrical sides
But doesn't bother me that much
Light weight  delvers a balanced sound and finally allows for some outside sounds  while not degrading music quality
Al at a reasonable price
I bought these earbuds to replace my old Sennheiser CX300-B which finally died after a couple of years of hard use
I figured the new ones would be a good value, but didn't expect them to sound considerably better than the old version
You're not going to get better sounding earbuds at this price
Lasted less than two months before the right earbud stopped working, not surprising considering the wires are paper thin
Sound quality was nothing to write home about, just over priced earbuds that aren't built to last
:(I've had $5 bargin bin JVC earbuds that sounded just as good and lasted years
I love Sennheiser products, this one is just ok, nothing special, glad I didnt pay a lot for them
the px 100 have increadble sound for the price
(over the ear)
These are the best earbuds I have ever owned
The noise isolation and frequency response are terrific
The price-to-quality is also very good
I consider Sennheiser products the Ferrari of audio
I don't understand why everyone gave this brand such high ratings
I personally think the free ones that came with my phone sound better
The worst part is that one side is longer than the other
The different lengths drive me crazy
Very nice bass, wears comfortably, until one week later one ear went out
The wiring inside the plastic handle of the jack seems loose and that one ear will only work if I bend it a certain way
I love the look of this set, very chic and small and elegant, hence the two starts
When I got these,  I was excited to have some quality headphones at a low price
But after a week of usage, the left ear-bud fritz out due to poor wiring  and now I have a broken pair
I'm willing to give Sennheiser another chance but to say at the least I am very disappointed
It's really worth for this price, much better than something like "BEATS" OR MONSTER
LOVE SENNHEISER, HIGH RATE OF USER LOVE IT
Good sound, not too pricey as I seem to go through headphones quickly
We will see if these are better constructed than my last set
I purchased the Sennheiser earbuds after trying multiple brands & styles in the under $200 range
My last purchase was the Klipsch Image S4 and good luck getting those to fit in both ears
Sound was respectable, but they just were not quite what I was looking for
When I first plugged in the Sennheiser'sthe powerful sound was impressive
Then I activated my DSP Manager I use on my HTC ONE and the tight low frequency response these are capable of is astounding to say the least
The cord is a little flimsy so I bought 3 more pair just in case
They Are That Good
Sennheiser is my " last stop " for earbuds purchasing under $200
I want to thank you so much for your help
I was looking for earplugs for my grandson and not knowing a thing about them i called  and also read
I told him  I had purchased these and he thought I did a bad thing
But I proved him young he was very impressed that grandma bought GREAT ONES
LOL Especially the bass
After all grandma knows nothing at all and he does being a whole 18 years old
HAHA  thanks
I hate earbuds because there is no technology to give you really great sound
I guess these are middle-of-the-road earbuds
Not sure if they're worth $30
Useless for music
Even still kind of annoying for podcasts
But I find this to be true for nearly all earbuds
I also think the hundred dollar iPhone earbuds I had were crap as well
Not only did they not sound that good, they electrocuted my ears when I sweated
Also, these headphones are geared so you wrap one around your neck
The length of one side is longer than the other
I don't know if I like that or not yet
Well I love them
They really block the noise around you, that's great
It's helpful when you are on the bus and you really don't wanna hear anyone around you, or at the gym when you don't want to hear the annoying music they play
I dislike a little bit that the right cable is longer so it has to go on the back of your neck
but well that's the design and it works just fine
The packaging is very very neat, it looks very fine, I was thinking that this would be the best gift
I have the "old" version of these headphones, which are also for sale on Amazon
I love them
They're indestructible, and they sound great
These earbuds have (accidentally) gone through the washer twice, and still sound as good as the day I got them
Sennheiser quality sound, Sennheiser performance
I got them for a great price and they sound fantastic
They're very bassy and pretty noise-canceling
They come in a nice carrying pouch and have 2 different sized ear buds to attach, one large, one small
I would recommend these
I bought these earbuds and a set of Klipsch s4As at about the same time
The Klipsch earbuds arrived first so I had experience with them when the Sennheiser's arrived
Both sets are good, but I prefer the Sennheisers because they provide much better bass than the Klipsch earbuds
I did very little research on what to get for ear buds and found these on sale on amazon with great reviews
so far these are the best ear buds ive used for under 60 bucks
great sound for the price
The bass of this product is amazing
For its price, why would people even waste extras for them fancy brands
Quality for such a price is what counts
Noice
I was a bit disappointing for the first few days, as they do have a burn in period as such
However, afterward, good god they are amazing
I have owned almost a dozen pairs of midrange headphones, and these blow them away
The channel separation is pro quality
When I turn up the bass range of the equalizer, I am always confident they will provide high fidelity lows without overcoming the treble or midrange
My bro has a pair of $600 sennheisers and his look unpleasant when he heard how mine were almost as good for sooo much less
When I lost these headphones
They are amazing
They're my favorite earbuds I've ever owned, and for the price they're well worth it
I listen to lots of EDM and what's prompted me to re-buy them was earlier today I was listening to a favorite song of mine, and realized that I was only getting about half of the experience out of my $10 earbuds
I also tried the highly-rated SoundSoul ones and truthfully nothing compares to the CX 300B
I was torn between this and the Sony MDR-EX210B, but what ultimately resulted in me buying these again was the build quality
People have complaints about the wires on the Sony, and I know that these Sennheiser wires are sturdy
So here I am, back again
Get these
I'm pretty picky about headphones, and really liked the first version of the cx300's until i cut the cord by accident
I had heard some mixed reviews on the mkIIs but gave them a shot
Excellent bass response and very natural sounding, would definitely buy again
The cables are a little thin but fairly tough
I couldn't get these to stay in my ears no matter what
The sound quality when held carefully in place is just mediocre
There is relatively little depth, soundstage, bass, etc
Too bad Sennheiser put their name on these when their other products are really pretty good sounding
These headphones have spectacular sound quality for "ear buds
" Typically, bass is quite attenuated with small headphones and higher frequencies are too loud relative to the entire spectrum
The shape of the headphone with the rubber cover fits snugly within the outer ear and sufficiently masks external sound
If you find that you use earbuds with an iPhone or iPod all the time, spend a few dollars and buy these
Love these things
Lost my Skull Candy earbuds and decided to upgrade a bit when I replaced them
Very glad I did
Nothing wrong with my last pair, but the Sennheiser are absolutely amazing
Having always used headphones that either came with other products or that cost less than $10 I could never understand why people would rave about their far more expensive headphones
But after literally dozens of people recommended me Sennheiser earbuds I decided to give them a try
All I can say is WOW
To have earbuds that actually comfortably stay where they're supposed to, deliver tremendous bass, and don't distort voices is a combination that I didn't think was possible
And best of all they didn't cost an arm and a leg
There is no way I could be any happier with this product
I haven't tried a ton of earbuds, but I use Sennheiser studio headphones and mics and decided to give these a try before hearing them
Very pleased - good sound (not flat like the studio headphones, much better for general music listening), good isolation, bass is audible but not muddy or over emphasized
The asymmetrical cable can be a slight annoyance when jogging, but overall I'm very satisfied
I have owned many headphones over the years
But these remain my favorites
Good value for the money
NIce sound
VERY comfortable
And I like the "behind the neck" design with one chord shorter than the other
This is my 3rd pair
One died after over use
And now I have two so I can keep one in my car and the other travels with my on other trips
It is embarrassing to be seen in these earbuds because of the way the cord lays on your person
It looks like you yanked the right earbud out of place and are haplessly wearing your earbuds askew
To explain, the headphones have an asymmetrical "J" design resulting in two issues
1
The weight of the heavy tangle-free main cord is carried solely by your left earbud; resulting in an uncomfortable left earbud and a weightless right earbud
2
The cord to the right earbud, as others have said, is much too long
Resulting in a cord that makes loops across your chest and irritably runs across your neck to meet with the left main cable
A buddy recommended these to me - they're the highest quality earbud you can get for your money
The sound is great, decent noise cancellation and they're easy to take with you on long trips
Just great, not going to write about specs or anything, looking for the Best you will get it with these earbuds
I'm not a genius on headphones but these are far and away the best earbuds I've ever purchased
If you want to invest in some good ear buds, these are a good option
p
s
are better than my last pair dre tour beats(whichever were the ear bud beats, I can't remember)
Edit: Lasted 5 weeks, a tad disappointed, ill take off a star for that
I probably would choose something with better build quality if I were to use ear buds with things such as an ipod/mobile device
These would be perfect for a stationary device
Currently own some Sennheiser on-ear headphones and decided it was time I added some in-ear pair as well
I was not disappointed, great sound to be expected from a quality brand
I use these everyday at the gym and they are comfortable and the sound is great
I don't have to listen to the nonsense coming from Fox news now
These headphones have good vallue - good bang for the buck
Great bass sound - way better than the cheap headphones most people use
I have a cemetery casket of dead headphones, and these are durable enough for manly daily use, and good enough to listen to for a long time
The earbuds are in my opinion very good for the money
Excellent noise reduction, with super clear audio
An excellent choice for anyone wanting a good set of earbuds that want break the bank
The carry case is very handy also, keeps them clean and handy in your pocket
I've searched high and low for earbuds that are effective at noise reduction for commuting and working in a noisy office
I've tried more expensive models in the $50-$150 range and can say that these are better than any of those and for a much better price
Our household has a pair for every family member
Be somewhat careful about storage because the wires can be sensitive
I abused them (slept in them, stuffed them in my pockets and purse) for over 18 months before some of the sound quality was compromised in one bud
I'm sure if they are properly cared for this wouldn't happen
I'll be buying another pair to replace
I love these
Although this is my thrid time buying them, because the wire gets stretched out, being as delicate as it is,
I got this for my birthday and I had my eye on these headphones for a lonnng time
I just hate the asymmetrical cords
These have been discontinued
Not sure why because they are Great
I actually ordered 2 sets
If you have found a better one for the price post it
Heads up they have an asymmetrical cord to the ears
Love that because I don't want any cords flapping in front of me getting in the way
man do these lines like to get tangled
Have to be somewhat careful in how you store them to prevent untangling the next time you use them
The speaker housing looks and feels cheap, at least compared to my old Jbud's aluminum chassis
But the sound quality from the CX's is far superior to the Jbud's
A great sounding product for the money but understand your buying for the impressive audio, not the material quality
I like the design, and it is a very reliable in-ear headphone
However, the sound quality is not what I expected
I prefer the klipsh s70
Although it is more expensive, the sound quality is way better than this
Great product
the bass could be better, but for the price its a great product, the bag to keep the headphone is great
I bought these earbuds to play jazz and some classical but mostly because of the brand name and have not been disappointed
They have a well-balanced sonic output and would probably scramble your brain if played too loud
Bass response always depends on proper fit in the ear
Make sure you install the best fitting adapters to get the best performance
I am not an audiophile
These are my first non apple earbuds, as I felt like an upgrade in sound
I heard that Sennheiser was a good brand, and got these for 35 dollars
I am not disappointed
The sound is very clear,and has a noticeable difference to cheap earbuds
For the price, I am pretty sure that you could not get better sound
The only strange thing to me was the uneven cables,that idea didn't make sense
I also wish it had a microphone
Overal, these are great for music, and I would highly recommend them
I just wish I had bought head phones these kind hurt my ears
This is nothing wrong with these earbuds its my ears are the problem, Great
I've been using my GS3 headphones for a year until I left them in my pocket and washed the pants
A friend recommended these so I gave them a try and I was blow away by the quality
Compared to the GS3 headphones these are amazing
Didn't expect one side to be longer than the other but it's all good and handy
Glad to have them
These are my first earbuds, and they sit in my ear reasonably well with one of the three ear-rubber-things that come with the headphones
The sound quality is good, especially if you aren't moving around too much--what I mean by this is that earbuds pick-up on all the low-frequency "thuds" that occur as the wires of the headphones hit your clothes and shake as you walk or do any motion, and these are a bit annoying
However, these "thuds" have nothing to do with these Sennheisers in particular--I think they're idiosyncratic to all earbuds
The reason this product has a 3 star rating from me is the material they used to cover the wires of the headphones
It's this black, "matte" material, which is super friction-y
This causes the wires to stick a little bit to any part of your body, and pull the earbuds out of your ears
For example, these earbuds are designed with the right earbud wire much longer than the left, so that you can wear them behind your neck--however, if you try to turn your head while wearing them, the friction-y wire material will rub against the back of your neck and pull the right earbud out
Overall, the sound quality is good, but they won't stay in my ears because of the constant pull from the sticky wire hitting my clothes
I love the sound and the price was affordable
this is the second earphone that i purchased
i loved it
i can recommend this to my friends
This headphones are amazing, im a guitar player and sometimes i like to play guitar with guitar rig so i plug in my laptop and use this headphones, sounds amazing
I can't say enough positive about these
They sound simply AMAZING
I use them with my Nexus 4 running Neutron Media Player
The sound is simply stunning
24bit lossless audio is crisp and full of depth
I've paid half the cost of these for skull candys (that always brake) and my lord does an extra $20 get you waaaaay better sound
My only "issue" is why is the left sides' cord half that of the right side
I received what I thought was a bad pair and the main middle wire came loose within one week of use
Amazon was quick to fix this
When I got the new ones the left side was STILL half the length as the right side
I can't find the logic
I've been a Sennheiser supporter for years and am stumped
On a funny note, it's actually a GOOD thing as I have a full beard 6inch and growing and the way these are made are perfect for me
Get these
I bought a pair of these a few years ago and wore them until the connection at the plug end wore out (the wires seem to fray on the inside from bending at their connection with the plastic around the jack)
The slightly newer version seems to have added a bit of reinforcement to that plug end, but I guess we'll see how long that lasts
These are great headphones for the price
These sound good, are reasonably comfortable, and are reasonably comfortable
Honestly, I prefer my JBuds and these cost a bit more
good bass--If you can keep the headphones tight in ur ears
that's the hard part
getting ear 'sponge' parts that keep them tight in your ears
I work in music, and I've been using the CX300 for about 6 years now
They are by far my favourite for fit, design, and value
I've also got the Apple in-ear headphones (the $79 ones) and a pair of Klipsch S4i
All of these are great headphones, but for sheer value and versatilit these offer excellent sound
Would buy another in a heartbeat
These earbuds were great, I just messed them up though jumping out of the way of a car
Wire got pulled and ripped off
Before that though, they worked great
One thing to be mindful of is that if the silicon earbuds are small and you will not hear anything unless your volume is VERY low
That is not why I almost died, but its a reminder to you peoples
LOL
Everything I expected the item to be, great sound quality and great for running
The ear buds DO NOT slip out while running
its ok beacuse sennheiser
sennheiser company is old and powerful for headphones but v moda is best in the world
I got these as a gift for my birthday last year
I was looking for great sound in a small package, and this is the one that you should pick
The sound is awesome
The bass is impressive, and the over all quality is great
Pretty clear and great sound
has a great bass and sound I can hear very clear in the noisy subway ;)
I really enjoyed these ear buds
The bass and sound quality is very good and i got them for very cheap
Only problem I would say is the different length of the left and right ear bud, and they wont stay in my ear when i use them when i am active
Other than that they are very good
I've owned several high end earbuds, these are the best
The range and depth of sound is superb
The highs in particular are very crisp and distinct
Mid-tones and bass are excellent
Excellent build quality
The input connector is substantial, durable, very well made
The soft rubber ear cushions are pliable, come in different sizes, snug fit without causing pain after prolonged use
I personally like the asymmetrical yoke (the lead to the right earbud is longer than the left)
This configuration tends to minimizetangles with clothing and other objects, easy to conceal
I use my earbuds at night, with the asymmetrical yoke I can quickly tell which is the right earbud, which is the left
Next time I upgrade Sennheiser will be my first consideration
The clear treble, the awesomeness of Bass
Truly a wonderful piece of tech by Sennheiser
One of the best purchases I have done on Amazon
The sound quality is average, I was a little bit disappointed how my apples ear buds sound better
The only good thing about this ear bud is that it offers pretty decent sound isolation
The sound is kinda muffled and not really clear
This is the second pair I have purchased from Amazon
The sound quality is decent, the fit is comfortable
I am satisfied with the purchase,
Bought these cause I read all the good reviews so I bought them
Waited for 1 week got them I opened the packaging and they're defective
Tried to get another pair but they were out of stock
Got the because my skullcandy broke down after a couple of year
They don't have the bass of the skullcandy, still they sound pretty neat
I loved this product when I got it
Clear sound, comfortable fit
My favorite earbuds that I've owned so far, however 6 months later the left earbud is going on me
All I do is walk to work with these in and use them in the office
I'm not at the gym sweating all over the earbuds or anything that could be considered extreme use, but alas, they're starting to fail me
Again, loved the sound and fit, but durability isn't a strong suit, which is why I'm only giving them three stars
i bought these so i could have something to wear at night while i was in bed
fantastic sound
punchy bass and highs never got tinny
protip: do not let these run through the washer and dryer, as it destroys them and they no longer sound good D=
The first thing I want to say about these is how infuriatingly easily this cord tangles
It's maddening
I had to buy "bobino" (the smallest size) at Container Store to deal with it
I've had these for a while, but finally got a different set of earbuds so a one-to-one comparison can be made
Equipment: NuForce uDAC USB headphone amp + flac or 320 kbps MP3s in VLC
Comparing: Sennheiser HD600 headphones, Sennheiser CX300II earbuds, NuForce NE-650M earbuds
First impression: it's staggering how different they all are
Sennheiser CX300II: by far the warmest, with the most mids
Highs very clear, bass well defined, but something is slightly off
The entire sound coloring feels a bit strange, almost muddy
Perhaps just very warm
NuForce NE-650M (slightly cheaper): very clear, providing excellent, really wide soundstage
Less mid-range in exchange for the sharpness and slightly over-exaggerated bass (the most bass of the three), feeling a bit aloof or cold because of that
All in all, excellent choice for the price
Sennheiser HD600 ($$$): as expected, nothing can touch these cans
The most any earbud can claim is not sucking completely in comparison, and these certainly stood the test, but unlike anything else, you just never want to take HD600s off
This was the 3rd Sennheiser CX 300 II I've bought, when I lost one I simply realize that I can't enjoy listening to music anymore with the others and end up buying a new one
Good for travels, working out and daily use
I bought mine for a cheap price on Amazon from 'Axecorp', worrying if it's a fake until I got it, and it was genuine
Good sound, very comfortable
Had Sennheiser MX550 previously so these are the first in ear buds and are very comfortable
Happy with the purchase
I'm not a huge fan of earbuds or headphones, so I didn't pay too much attention to what I was using
I would get some Sony or Panasonic earbuds for 20 bucks
This time I saw these on sale for $30 something, so decided to try
I can say that Sennheiser CX 300B MK is way better that anything I tried before
But still, I much prefer my car sub
They were no where near as good as you'd thing for the money they cost
Boring, average sound quality and they taste terrible
The ear buds sound excellent with deep bass, however, I cannot get them to stay comfortably in my ears
I much prefer the CX 215 ear buds that sound pretty much the same but have a little 'handle' on the back of the bud to help place them in the ear canal
For whatever reason, the 215s fit better and stay in better
and he loves it =)I was replacing his old ones that a dog chewed up and he was excited to get these
His last pair lasted him more than 6 years
If the dog hadn't chewed it up, it would probably still be kicking
They work very well on the planes in blocking most of the noise
Not quite noise canceling but they are easier to carry
The first pair I bought lasted for over three years
Those cost me almost twice as much as this pair
nice set of ear phones would suggest but the bass of the gear does not sound deep and strong but it does keep outside noise out
left side did not work just after 6 months using,  it's not worth the price, the sound is good but the quality is so poor
I don't think these earbuds are particularly comfortable, but they produce really good sound for their price
The reason for 3 stars is the stupid cord
I really didn't think the uneven lengths for each ear would bother me but its terrible
The left ear bud is half as long as the right, and it gets pulled out constantly
My first product from Sennheiser and I'm in love
Sound is incredibly clear with great bass all the way though
I'm no audiophile, but I know a great pair of headphones when I hear them
And these are Amazing
I bought these to replace my Beats by Dre and love these way more
From the first time I put them on, I was impressed
They're great for commuting around NYC
Totally cancel out the noise and let you enjoy whatever music's playing
Recommended them to a friend and she LOVES them too
he really loves these headset ear buds, he is a runner and workouts they stay put
he says he will always recommend them
Heres my review almost a year later, these earbuds still sound great and the wire hasn't twisted likehedphone wires normally do
i take it out of my pocket several times to change the song
Im surprised they still work, usually headphones last me a bout 3 months
I would recommend this product to anyone seeking true audio quality for your $
I have tried a few different pairs in the past, and i have always chosen these headphones over and over again
What i really love about these is the bass, how deep the sound is, and how rich it is at high levels
While other headphones i have used in the past have better isolation, it's really not important as the sound quality in my opinion
Simply, you can not go wrong with these headphones for the price
The only negative thing i have to say about these headphones is the build quality of the cord
A few times it has came apart on the auxiliary end, almost detaching itself from the inner cords
I used a mini zip tie to tighten and secure the material in place so as to not detach the cables inside
But it was my fault in the first place as it snagged on some equipment i was using at the gym
I hope people give these headphones a chance, as they will be much delighted for the price
I'm sort of a audiophile, always searching for quality and economic balance; none have been as satisfying as a purchase as Sennheiser's
Great product and quality
Very recommend to buy
This was the cheapest product on the market and i loved it
Excellent earphone quality
I opened these babies up and they sounded great right out of the package
They slide into your ears easily without creating pressure
Left and Right are clearly marked
Bass is boosted but not muddy
Highs and mids are clear
Another package arrived in the mail a few weeks ago: A small box from Amazon, which contained a pair of Sennheiser CX-300B MKII Precision earbuds, my latest pair for review
After a month of use, here are my thoughts and opinions
Sennheiser GmbH &Co is a privately owned German company, in business for over 60 years
They produce a well-known and thorough lineup of audio equipment, from consumer to professional grade, including speakers, microphones, headphones and even avionics
Suffice it to say, they know a thing or two about recording and reproducing sound
The Sennheiser CX-300B MKII is one of the lower priced earbud models available from Sennheiser, (just a step above their CX-200 model) and is priced at $59
95 retail
Competitors in this price range include the ubiquitous Klipsch Image S4 and the NuForce 700x, among others - and the Sennheisers do indeed give them a run for their money
Simply but neatly packaged, the CX-300 features an asymmetrical cable, roughly 1
2m long, with a fairly robust, L-shaped plug at the end
The cable feels somewhat rubbery and is reasonably resistant to tangling
The cord design is asymmetrical, designed so that the cord leading to the right earpiece is routed behind the neck when worn
Although this has been confusing to some, it is designed as a safety and ergonomic feature, to minimize the amount of cable in front of the wearer
The earbuds themselves are relatively small and light and sit well in the ear, with very little protrusion
Because of this, they are comfortable to wear for extended periods
Also included with the CX-300B MKII are three sizes of eartips to help find the best fit to the individual wearer, as well as a small, soft-sided vinyl pouch for storage when not in use
All of this is well and good, I hear you thinking, but how do they sound
Well, I'm glad you asked
The answer, I would say, is very good
After a short burn-in (during which the sound did seem to improve noticeably), they performed very well
The original CX-300 was reportedly well-known for its strong bass performance, at times being accused of being a bit too bass-heavy
Sennheiser apparently heard these criticisms and tuned this newer model towards a slightly more balanced sound profile
The bass is still there, and it is still full and rich, but not at the expense of other areas of the music
These are not bass-heavy, "Beats wannabes" but they do produce enough bass to make music fun
Mids are full and warm and highs are clear and clean, but did not overpower the mids and low frequencies
Overall, a very enjoyable, listenable pair of earbuds, capable enough to handle most types of music
I tried them with jazz (Hancock, Marsalis and Coltrane, among others), rock (Aerosmith, The Cure, Foo Fighters, etc) and classical, as well as some contemporary country and ambient music and these seemed to handle just about anything I could throw at them
I noticed virtually no sibilance or distortion, even at higher sound levels
Speaking of which, the CX-300s are quite sensitive, producing a good level of volume from a moderate input level, their sound being noticeably louder than say, the JVC HA-FX3X
Soundstage was decent too, with good separation, clarity and detail without lacking in warmth
The build quality seems plain but sturdy, with a thick, angled plug that seems more than able to standup to abuse
Specifications (for all you tech-heads out there - and you know who you are) are as follows:Impedance: 16 ΩFrequency response: 19 - 21000 HzSound pressure level (SPL): 113 dBCable length: 1
2 mTransducer principle: DynamicThe CX-300B is a very capable performer and a definite upgrade from the stock earbuds
Well worth the money
The problem with these earphones is a constant background hiss
The free Samsung earphones are actually better because of this hiss
The sound on these earphones are excellent but after using them for two months one of the earbuds is way quieter than the other one
I am disappointed - not in the sound quality but in the actual device quality
A very accurate description was given about the product, though one ear-bud line is much shorter than the other
The entire set still fits very well when placed in ears, but it handles in a way that I wascould not used to (however, I am used to it now)
It was  a detail that I would have liked to know ahead of time (hence, four stars were given)
All in all, this is a great product with fantastic, quality, crisp sound (the bass is just wonderful) and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a less expensive alternative to something close to "high-end
"
I have no issues with the sound quality, not that I'm an expert of sound or anything
My husband & I like this brand
I'll have to agree with the others that the wires are pretty thin
Thats my only negative
Still gonna keep & use ; )
I am always very wary when buying earbuds because I cant sacrifice sound quality for portability
I am a bit of an audiophile, but I also am on a bit of a budget
These earbuds are great because you get some great bang for your buck
These have great sound quality and great isolation
I was a little worried the "Enhanced Bass" would be a little much for me, considering I never throw my bass up, but it is really nice
It gives the music a nice feel, and unlike a lot of earbuds, good, well balanced bass and treble
I would strongly recommend these earbuds, but remember, if you are playing the music through a garbage device
no matter how good the headphones are, it is going to sound like garbage
I love my bass and don't want to buy into expensive earbuds to get it
These are my work earbuds
I can't use headphones, but also dont to compromise
So far the bass reproduction has been top notch
I've replaced my old Klipsch S4 and am very happy
As far as fit goes there are 2 important things that affect me
1 - I have different sized ear canals
Something I never found out until wearing in-ear earbuds2 - The earbuds must be easily cleaned
No matter how well you clean these things can definitely pick up some unwanted gunk
For me the tips had enough give to fit without giving me a headache
The opening on the tips is nice and wide making the cleaning process very easy
Coming from the Klipsch S4 which had a very tiny opening this is a godsend
I highly recommend these and would buy again
if this is your first time looking at more expensive earbuds instead of the <$25 earbuds you normally get at walmart or target, you probably are skeptical about spending this kind of money on a pair of earbuds
but they are 100% worth the extra ~$10-15
Sennheiser is a world renowned audio technology company and this product far exceeded what i expected in being accustomed to the cheep-o things in supermarkets
for being moderately priced earbuds, they have fantastic bass and over all amazing sound
now thats not to say they rival the sound of other on or around ear headphones of Sennheiser, but as earbuds go, they have fantastic sound quality and are definitely worth the money
the only thing to keep in mind is that on one of the earbuds, the cable is a good foot or so longer than the other
don't ask me why they did this, to be honest it is more of an annoyance than anything, but that is the only complaint about them
if you are the type to take care of your things (electronics especially) and love music as much as i do while enjoying the convenience of earbuds, i would recommend these to you without a doubt
These Sennheiser earbuds have incredible sound and are low priced
Good for everyday use, not too comfortable for sports
Highly recommended
Just received these
plugged them in and 2 seconds into listening sat back w/ complete satisfaction
Great fit
GREAT sound
Super light - and amazing price for the sound quality
Good highs and mids, with perfect and deep bass
VERY PLEASED
Muddy,booming bass combined with a poor seal makes for mediocre headphones
Lacking any good high end or definition
It also has this odd behavior of making a very loud clicking noise when I'm inserting them into my ears
I bought these instead of a bulky noise canceling over the ear headphones
The fit for my ear was excellent and the sound was fantastic
Good sound, very comfortable
Had Sennheiser MX550 previously so these are the first in ear buds and are very comfortable
Happy with the purchase
I'm not a huge fan of earbuds or headphones, so I didn't pay too much attention to what I was using
I would get some Sony or Panasonic earbuds for 20 bucks
This time I saw these on sale for $30 something, so decided to try
I can say that Sennheiser CX 300B MK is way better that anything I tried before
But still, I much prefer my car sub
I though i was getting pretty decent ear buds but when i used them they sounded very muddy and a severe lack of bass
Their barely acceptable but certainly not worth the price
The only problem I have with these is that they greatly boost volume compared to what I'm used to
However, they're of a much better quality than most earphones in this range
I also have the Klipsch Image X10 http://www
amazon
com/gp/product/B000WAHFBK/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_90 and I can say that assuming that those are representative of earbuds in its respective price range, then you're better off buying the Sennheiser CX 300B Mk IIs for earbuds and saving the money for higher end full-sized headphones instead
These are the most reasonably priced hi-fi earbuds I know of
I use these as my work headphones and they get the job done
Good balanced sound and do a good job of sealing out outside noise
This is my second pair of Sennheiser earbuds and I'm enjoying them
Can't go wrong with Sennheisers and their not too expensive so thats nice as well
I love these earbuds because a person sitting five feet away can not hear what you're listening to
They're so good at canceling ambient noise that I make sure not to eat while wearing them because of I can hear myself chewing in surround sound
I'd love it if the earbuds would be a bit more comfortable
I need to readjust them quite often
I just recently bought a pair of SkullCandy 50/50's, but they will NOT work in either of my mp3 players, either computer, or my phone without pulling the jack out and holding it there
They worked wonderfully on anything "Apple" however
I bought these to replace them since I won't buy Apple
These earbuds are wonderful
Bass is big without overpowering you, mids and trebles are dynamite (although highs seem prematurely capped sometimes, all types of music)
The volume (because of the driver size) is MUCH better than I'm used to (Shure, Klipsch (3 pairs), Denon, you name it)
Not as loud as the SkullCandys, but CRYSTAL clear
Not sure about the different cord length to each earbud yet, but it absolutely helps me tell right from left
I got these on sale, and they're easily the best purchase I've made for the money in a LONG time
All that remains is to see how long they'll last
The cords/connections aren't "delicate", but they're close
And they do tangle pretty easily
I'm really digging deep for any "cons", as you can tell
Buy 'em
I bought these headphones about a year ago
They sound great and they're super durable unlike many other earbuds I've used
Just started using them yesterday, but so far I am very pleased
They achieve great volume and great clarity
Highly recommended for the value
This is all you need
Best bang for your buck
Considering most of us have low quality stolen music or we pandora this is as fancy as you need to go for in ear head phones
Got these for my trip to NYC in and out of the subway easy small head phones to stash in a pocket
Comes with a great case too
Sound quality is amazing great bass / super loud
My adult son recommended these earbuds, and he was right (as usual)
They are the only ones that don't hurt my ears
I bought these buds based on positive reviews on Amazon
So far, they are performing well, but I am waiting for these to burn in and hope to hear more bass when they come around
Great service, as promised delivery
Great bass and sound is awesome
I will change the size of the rubber earbud cover as it doesn't stay deep within my ear
My tech guy at work recommends Sennheiser products for quality and reliability as he using a lot of their equipment for AV work
Very happy with the product so far
best
in ears
ever
I absolutely fell in love with these headphones
I can hear each sound clearly and precisely
I bought these as a relatively low cost replacement for my SHURE 115 earbuds  that I left in a hotel room
I would not buy these again
Nothing against Sennheiser, I've owned their headphones over the years and always liked them
Sound: Tinny, harsh, overall weak
Disappointing
Possibly closely related to the next aspect
Fit: Poor
The tips are so short they do not extend far enough into (my) ear canal to hold in place, or to block external sound
Hence they fall out constantly
The sound is poor
Unless you have very short/shallow ear canals, DO NOT BUY THESE
They will not fit
A review I read prior to buying them made this cautionary remark
Should have heeded it
I tried several other silicon and foam cushions to no avail--the cable gets in the way
Durability: After a year, sound is dropping out of the left bud
Maybe a result of my trying to cram them into my ear canals
Spend the money and buy the SHURE 115
From what I'd tried, they are the best balance of $, sound, and fit
They can be a bit fragile too--all  of these thin wire devices are touchy
-sound is amazing
with a good bass-using from 6 months
no problems at all-quality is so good
I m not afraid of any loose connection in earbuds
Great quality
had to replace because dog chewed up the first pair
This was the only place to finally get the ones I had before
I used them for around 3 months and the right headphone just died
oh well
this is very mild use and minimum traveling with it too
decent for the price until it just dies
I have owned several pairs of these earbuds, the sound is excellent, the bass is great
This is in contrast to lower priced earbuds which have inferior bass response
These are the best I've used for the price, a good value
Be advised, these buds feature unequal length ear bud wires, so one can tell left from right easily
Some people don't like this
These are 5 stars
Have tried many others
These sound and feel the best
Love the cord length, ie for around neck, one size longer than other, for wearing under clothing
Excellent product will order again
Hope for long-life expectancy
I mostly use these for work in the studio when I need to be precise
The quality is superb for the price as they rival buds that are far more expensive
I had a pair of Bose IE2($100) before, and the quality difference is not much
For buds they do indeed block out a lot of outside sound, perhaps a little too much if you need to be aware of your surroundings
Be aware that they need to be burned in
The sound quality started off so/so but quickly improved after a few days of heavy use
Another thing, people often complain about them fitting in your ears/getting a powerful low end
All you have to do is make sure you create a good seal
I personally do it by lifting up the top of my ear to open the canal, then insert
It's pretty simple
Much like you would do with expanding earplugs
I would recommend them to other sound engineers and casual listeners who want good frequency range without paying a fortune
NOTE: When mixing very complex arrangements, you may find the mid range not crisp enough
Also not the best choice for running
There can be quite a bit of wire noise when you move around
I would definitely buy these again
I've been using this for over a year and still liking it
I use it daily, and the wires have not gotten brittle or fragile
Other products tend to break inside and lose sound
These have stood up to a lot of wear
Great sound and build quality
My headphones usually last 6 months before one side stops working but not these they keep going and sound better than any pair I've ever used
after 20 days ,it arrived China
It's more potal than my px100 by bus
but is easy dirty ,how to do
clean ear
Recommended, basses sounds good
Fix good in your ears
Includes a practical and very cool bag
And a awesome Design
But they are very frail
I've bought my second pair of these
The only reason for that is because I lost the little black cap that goes in your ear on my older pair :(
ANYWAYS, the DEAL with these earbuds is that YOU CAN WEAR THEM TO SLEEP
I ONLY DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE IN COLLEGE BECAUSE I COULD WEAR THESE WHILE LAYING ON MY SIDE IN BED
THIS IS THE ANTI-BADROOMMATE CURE
I bought these on the basis of the price versus rating and name recognition
I thought they would be better than the nornal $10 major chain fare-but they really are not
It's not that they are bad-it's just that they are mediocre
For having enhanced bass they sure sound flat
All that aside I do like them-they are realtively comfortable (can wear them all day without any discomfort) and project a clear clean sound while allowing me to still hear my phone and for my coworkers to get my attention
I do agree with the other reviewers that the cord thing is really more gimmicky than helpful
Would I recommend-probably not as you can still get Skull Candy earbuds for like 10 bucks that will fit just as well and sound just as well
So you can use this as a reference, these earbuds were connected to a Ipod touch playing a wide range of different musical styles (Godsmack to Miles Davis to Edith Piaf to Sublime)
Sounds great with amazing depth and detail
I am very happy with this product and highly recommend you check them out
I don't find any difference between the skull candy 10$ ear buds and these
Not up to my expectations for something that's 30 bucks
This is the second pair of CX 300B earbuds that I have owned and they work great - clear sound and also work well at reducing ambient noise such as the drone from plane engines
I travel a lot at previously had used a couple of over-the-ear noise cancelling headphones and while they worked as advertised then they were rather bulky and took up too much space in my hand luggage
I purchased my first pair to see how comfortable they were and to check out their performance - I was satisfied on both counts
The sound is clear and the bass is pretty decent and they stay in place and do not irritate even if work for long periods of time, such as long haul flights
They are also extremely compact and come with a nice little pouch for storage and so take up practically no room in my hand luggage
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to fellow travelers
I am a professional DJ and over the years i have had some great dual cup style headphones and earbuds
Out of all the earbuds in the price range these are the best i have heard
The sound is crystal clear with no noise and great noise isolation
After you break them in properly, the bass is rich and full of clarity and depth, while the mids are warm and bountiful and the highs are perfectly balanced to match the overall sound
These are what i carry with me on a daily basis
Bought these for my Ipod based on other reviews
The stock earbuds had ok sound but was looking for a better fit
Even after trying all 3 sizes of earbuds these do not fit as well as stock apple earbuds
There is absolutely no bass (stock apple has a deeper richer sound) and the earbuds seem to have a "hollow, tinny" type sound
I have switched back to my stock earbuds
Maybe other folks will have a different experience, but the effect of having two unequal lengths on the earbud cords was that the shorter cord always had more tension on it and pulled out of my ear repeatedly
This made these earbuds, in fact, absolutely unusable for me
Very frustrating
I gave them away
Tho I did like the sound they provide, they didn't make it to one year, the right earbud stopped working
For the money these are great value
The sound from these buds are better than some other more expensive ones I have tried
A buddy of mine recomended them and said he loved his-  I never would have thought the sound quality would be as wonderful as it is
well worth the money spent and then some
Good quality with very decent price
If u are going to choose earbuds with professional music performance, but not willing to pay more than 100, thats your choice
These sound awesome, very nice and full
Good bass but not too much
My only complaint is the wires are really thin and I'm giving them as a birthday present to a 14 year old, and this 14 year old breaks stuff easy
What a shame, maybe he will want to trade for my Apple earbuds
heh heh heh
Had a pair, lasted about 4 years before the sound in one side was gone
Did some research, decided to purchase the same pair
Need I say more
I bought these buds based on positive reviews on Amazon
So far, they are performing well, but I am waiting for these to burn in and hope to hear more bass when they come around
Great service, as promised delivery
Great bass and sound is awesome
I will change the size of the rubber earbud cover as it doesn't stay deep within my ear
My tech guy at work recommends Sennheiser products for quality and reliability as he using a lot of their equipment for AV work
Very happy with the product so far
My son introduced this product to me because he likes it & brought couple of them for friends
This is the best earbuds I ever have
great
These earbuds are excellent quality and have even better sound
The bass is top notch
I would recommend this product
I purchased these and did a blind test with the Panasonic RPHJE120K
The Panasonics were clearly better, had better bass, clearer highs,and fit my ears really nicely
The overall design is much better and they're ~$10 (less than ten bucks usually)
The Sennheisers fall out of my ears all the time and have really awkward design
During the blind test it almost sounded tinny
Had this product for 3 years until I ripped the earpiece off from being careless on the airplane
Rebought it easily with no second thoughts
They stay in during all my workouts (marathons, CrossFit, lifting, jump roping)
this sennheiser are pretty good considering their averagely low price
i would say there is a bit too 'artificial' bass but for the average user it will be great
considering the price, this is one of the greatest options you can get
not suitable for professional usage but it will be great for just iphone/ipod users
Good sound quality, plenty of bass
Noticeable improvement in sound on Pandora compared to the cheap earbuds I usually use or even the ipod earbuds
The only quibble I personally have is with the cord length
The cords that run from the buds to the main are of different lengths
Product description states that it aids in prevents cords from tangling but personally I found it to be inconvenient
Great sound in the beginning, however after using for about 1 1/2months
For no apparent reason the right earpiece stopped working
The wires are all good their is no visible evidence why
Quality construction comes to question here
I own a set of Sennheiser headphones (cover the ears) which greatly exceed these buds in terms of sound quality andsharpness but I also paid a good deal more for them
I'm using these buds with a portable radio (not exactly"hi-fi")and my laptop, and I find them appropriate for most "talk" applications (the news, a ball-game, most DVD movies)
But, for a long focused session with your favorite music
No
I got what I expected and would repeat this purchase
They were a gift for my daughter
She had the same pair before and was very satisfied-- so much that she wanted the exact same ones again
Very good, worth every penny
I lost mine but I am thinking of buying another pair
Best earbuds I have ever owned
I was looking for something lightweight to reduce some of the loud noise in the gym while I listen to talk podcasts
Sennheiser is a good brand and the $70 CX300B were on closeout sale price for $30
Looked great
I tried to find the right size tips
Not easy to decide
Then I had to watch video tutorials to learn how to insert them
The start for every workout is getting the earbuds in place, then putting a headband around them to keep them there
After ten minutes of getting them into place, they do a decent job of attenuating noise  After about ten minutes of exercise, the left earbud falls out, even into the headband
Excellent quality sound, but not needed for talk podcasts
Bottom line: Great quality sound
Decent noise isolation
Terrible for inserting and keeping them in place
Not very good for my purposes
These headphones are great for their price
Great sound and quality
*Just be aware that they have an asymmetrical cord design
I absolutely loved these when I got them
They were small, comfortable, sounded great, and came in a nifty little case
However, the right earbud can't is barely audible now - maybe after 6 months of normal use on my desk - I rarely moved them
It's disappointing that something started off so well then degraded so quickly
I had to buy a new pair of headphones since these stopped working properly
These are cheap department store headphones
The sound is tinny and hollow
It's what you'd expect for thirty bucks, except I paid almost triple that overseas for these guys
There is barely any passive noise blocking from these in-ears; the build is cheap; the cable is thin; the headphone jack is chintzy; the packaging sucks
Perhaps they deserve 2 stars because they do play music
They do that
Just not well
The best sub-$100 in-ears - and best headphones overall that I've ever owned, including more expensive cans - are the $89 Grado iGi model
The only reason I bought the Sennheisers was because, after over 2 years and a lot of beating, one of the ears died on the Grados, and I'm waiting to go back to the US to pick up my next pair
Do yourself a favor and get the Grados or something else
Don't save a few bucks by buying this cheap crap
If you find this review helpful, click "Yes" below so that others can be fully informed about this product too
I decided to step up from the basic $9
99, to get some better base and depth to my music, and after seeing all the positive reviews, was feeling confident in these headphones
I found them to be only SLIGHTY better sound than my cheap brand
Not worth the 30+ dollars I shelled out
Save your cash, or spend (a lot) more and buy some higher end earbuds
UPDATE 4/1/2013 - I dropped my score to 1 star, because over the weekend I used my gs3 bundled headphones and I found the sound to be A LOT better
Even though they are the semi-crappy manufacturing ones included, I was blown away by how much better and richer they sound, AND they have a built in mic
Its true, you either spend 9
99 for the basics, or you buy the 100+, anything in between is just a waste of cash
Great quality
My first pair survived 3 washing/drying machine trips and still worked
no lie
Had them for about 3 years and put them through a lot of trail runs, rides and more
they finally crapped out
Had a pair of Dr Dre Beats that lasted about 2 months they were the in-ear ones too
I think the quality is the same for the music produced
Sticking with these over anything else
When it comes to earbuds its pretty much inevitable that they will eventually break down due to cord issues due to rolling them up or general wear and tear (assuming you are mobile with them)
Having said that, when looking for headphones I have the following criteria:1
they cannot be so expensive that when they eventually fail it will significantly irritate me, this means anything above 70 dollars was not considered by me
2
they need to last, even if they fail I expect the earbuds to last at minimum around a year at full functionality (with daily use)
3
they need to be comfortable and stay in place
4
the sound quality needs to be very good, for the price range I am looking at I do not expect ultra premium sound quality but something a step below but manages to perform better than the price would suggest
I have had the same pair for almost a year now these earbuds have met all those requirements, the sound quality is very good and at a level equal to above that of other earbuds I have purchased for more than twice the price
I have had many different brands and prices from $10-$100 all failed at some or all the above criteria
These are easily the best bang for the buck, they are durable, have the sound quality and are at a price that when they eventually do fail I will replace the the same line
I absolutely love these headphones - great for working out, for listening to while working in a crowded office, or listening to music on a plane
This is my second pair - after my cat ate through the wire of my first pair, I immediately ordered a replacement pair of the exact same product
:)
I use these all the time and they work great, look great, that's all that needs to be said so get yours now
This is the second pair I have, the first one lasted a few years - far longer than any earbuds I've ever owned
The sound is very clear, a decent bass although at very high volumes (and especially with lo-fi MP3s), the trebles can get quite tinny and shrill
But overall, I doubt you'll find earphones this good anywhere near this price
these are the greatest earbuds ive ever owned
the sound quality is great, just the right amount of bass, durable, and cheap
these are amazing
It doesn't completely eliminate plane noise, but reduces it enough to hear music, movies, etc
Comfortable and build quality seems solid
Carrying case provides a place to safely store them when not in use
These are excellent if you like muddy, bloated bass and a nonexistant midrange
If you listen to genres like metal or rock, which pretty much needs good mids to sound good, steer clear of these and go for the cheaper Ultimate Ears 500
I use my earbuds to listen to a digital recorder/player which has a small speaker
Because I have a hearing loss, this device is hard to hear without the earbuds which bring the sound right to my ears so I can listen in a car or airplane or at home
I would recommend them to anyone who wants great listening to speech or music and to anyone with a hearing loss
Because the earbuds have 3 sizes of pads I have had no trouble fitting my small ears securely
I'm mostly writing this so I can remember which headphones I own
But in all seriousness, these are possibly the best earbuds I've ever owned
I bought these for my son
a budding audiophile
He loves them
I love the fact that they didn't cost that much and he is very happy with them
Sounds Great
They are passive noise canceling because how the ear piece is designed
I but for stars because I don't like the asymmetric lengths of the left and right ear
Get the Sennheiser cx 500 if you can find them
Or something similar
Sennheisers are good headphones
They're light, produce great bass and come with different size rubber attachments to fit your ear
I love the behind the neck style since you can remove the headphones and they don't fall
Solid construction, beautiful leather pouch, no issues with the three sets I've owned and lost
Rich bass and high mids
I replaced the CX 300 that I thought it was original (but it turned out that were copies) with these earphones, and I must say that there is a quality leap in the sound isolation and sound quality
As I expected, CX 300B MK II are very heavy bass earbuds, but for the gym, jogging, and outside activities, It Does The job
they come with a pouch and different sizes of earbuds
***************04-25-2014 EDIT******************************One of the earbuds stopped working just a year of light use
Shame on you Sennheiser, where is your famous GERMAN quality
Costumers can't be buying a set of earbuds every month or so
Come on
I had these exact set of ear buds and used them with my iPhone and iPod and loved the comfort and great fit, so when I lost the ear buds found these and knew was what I wanted again
Glad they were still available
As far as quality/price goes this is the PERFECT combination
The sound is great, the bass is not overwhelming, mids sound clear and the highs are crisp
I use these under my helmet when I ride my motorcycle (only one earbud though), I can honestly say that they cancel out A LOT of external sounds
TIP1) Make sure you use the correct size for your ear2) To go from good to WOW I had to use the right side earbud in my left ear3) Make sure the earbud has the correct end piece on, it make a HUGE sound differenceI would recommend these to anybody that needs their music to sound a certain way (music sounds great)
Don't buy the expensive designer headphones
Get these
Your ears wont regret it
Sennheiser has always had the best deals on headphones
It took me a few days to adjust to the different lengths of the ear buds
I use these for listening to books on my I-pod while walking my dog
Since I only use one bud at a time, the sound is clear and blocks most of the traffic noise
I might also say this is the first time I used buds other than those that came with the I-pod
excelente sonido, los bajos son muy nítidos a pesar de ser unos audífonos tan pequeños
los compré para usarlos mientras hago ejercicio y se ven muy buenos, realmente los recomiendo
Okay, unlike some others on here, I'm not incredibly well-versed with regard to ear buds and their various quality levels
That said, I can honestly say that these are the best pair I've ever owned
And for the price
It's just a steal
The last pair I had were some Sony throwaways, and they never sounded punchy enough
Before that was a pair of Skullcandy FMJ's, and while they did sound good (but not as good as these) one of the buds just stopped working, like it had a bad wire
I don't know quite what I was expecting when I got these, but whatever it was, it was exceeded in every way
I don't even have to use any EQ settings--I've got my player on flat at the moment, and it sounds amazing
Just get them
You won't likely regret it unless, like some other reviewers, you're going to run with them I guess
No experience there on my end, but I can say they fit oh so snugly in my ear canals
Get them
These headphones offer amazing sound
Your music will sound great
These headphones are lacking in the durability department
They do not fit especially well (when moving or exercising) and I found myself adjusting them all the time
If your intention is to get supreme sound for a low cost and then sit at your desk and listen, then these are the headphones for you
But if you intend on exercising or if you are looking for headphones to carry with you throughout the day, everyday
you will want something with better durability
I was really disappointed in the manufacturing quality of these headphones
The connection between the headphone and my iPod or iPhone jack never felt really secure, and within a month of use the headphones were already starting to fail
You know story by now I'm sure
you have to wiggle the male connector around to get the sound in full, and if it's moved the audio starts to cut out, and this problem will get worse and worse over time
Now a few months after purchase and the headphones have almost failed completely
I have owned enough ear buds in my life to know this sort of thing is inevitable, but I have never owned a pair that failed as fast as this one
It's even worse when you consider this isn't a $6-$15 pair of ear buds
At $30, I expected a lot more
I would not recommend these headphones because of the very poor manufacturing quality, but also because the audio quality wasn't even that great
These things are not much better than the cheap ear buds you can get for $10 at a big box store
If you are getting these to replace your original iPod ear pieces, keep the ipod ones
I still say the factory iPod ear pieces are the best
There is not enough base and when I use them for talking, multiple people have commented that it sounds echoey
Listening to others talk was definitely inferior to my Apple headphones
And like many people have commented, the uneven cord length is more a nuisance than a help
I'm sorry I purchased these but did so after reading many reviews that I found were very misleading
These were purchased as an upgrade to the incredibly mediocre ear-bud headphones that came with an mp3 player
For a long while these replacements (astounded with a number of caveats)
Here are my disappointments in ascending order:* Sound quality (5): I'm sure these are very 'technically good' specs wise but they are only as good as the fit they can make in your ear
For me this was difficult many times and so I have resigned myself to not be able to enjoy the full sound they can provide
* The right ear piece's cord is extremely long and can make it difficult to manage (4)
If you are into (and used to) longer right ear pieces then this is probably fine for you
I have come to decide that I do not like it, though
It gets in the way, becomes very tangled if left to dangle free and when trying to get ready for use
When I wrap the right ear piece behind my head like it is probably intended to be used I don't care for the feeling and yet somehow manages to feel too short
* Inner-ear fit (3): I use these in some fairly active scenarios but even when I am not being active with these I can find it difficult to get a good fit that doesn't eventually annoy me -- or slip away from a good fit
Using the same size of ear tips resulted in my left ear being a pretty great fit and the left one being too loose or at least not "air tight" in the same way
Perhaps this is a personal curse but it is frustrating to get a good fit on one side and the other never has felt (and therefore sounded) as good
* Fit and sound while jogging (2): Ugh
This was a significant side to my negativity and what I was really hoping would be an improvement over my stock ear-buds
They are better and sound better but the cord can produce tremendous noise in movement if not managed properly
Luckily, I have a clip attached to the main cord that enables me to handle the situation much better than when I did not have it
The clip is a NECESSITY and I'm not sure if or where you would buy one
Don't try to go jogging without it
* Deteriorating sound quality (1): I do not listen to music at a terrific volume
I do my best to take care of things that I care about
My efforts have not been enough to maintain these headphones in decent shape
Most notably, the right ear piece has lost about 50-70% of the decibels of the left one
The sound is incredibly unbalanced now and very frustrating to experience and realize they have just expired the return period
I want to return these as they are now in a state that anyone would consider broken
There are VERY few return policies that I ever read "
manufacturer defects
" without scoffing to myself that "that would never happen" because it hasn't for me
Now I feel as though it has
These headphones have not withstood the test of time; they are 5+ months old and are now frustrating to listen to under any circumstances
The left ear piece appears to have also lost some sound quality but it is not objectively worse -- just subjectively
I am now shopping for new headphones and really crossing my fingers that whatever I find will hold out and fit better than these did
Note that I was decently satisfied (4-5 stars) for many months of use but I can no longer recommend this product due to my various disappointments
Other reviews should be able to be more helpful regarding sound quality and what this device is at its best
I believe that it deserves to be a 4-5 star product; it just has not panned out that way for my ears, my usage, and my particular item off the assembly line
I wish you best of luck, Sennheiser CX 300B MK II Precision enhanced bass earbuds; you will be missed and I hope you treat the other buyers better than you have me
I thought I was getting a great deal at $36 but you evidently were not for me
RIP
Thought I'd get myself some decent earbuds for listening to music at work
I spend a lot of time coding, working with equipment, and reading, so I needed a comfortable pair of earbuds that would have reasonably good sound
The CX 300B MK II had decent reviews, a couple of audiophiles complaining they weren't good enough, and carried an excellent brand name
I thought I'd spring the little extra cash $27 for the pair when I bought them
Initially, I was really confused about the unbalanced wire design before I realized that the short side goes directly to your ear and the long side goes around your neck to relieve tension
I ended up really liking that configuration
What I didn't get was actually good noise
These buds aren't really worth it
I played around with different sized earbuds to get a comfortable fit (that's nice) and while the sound is acceptable for my needs, it's not better than a cheap $10 pair of earbuds
The cable is also this incredibly grippy black rubber that sticks to everything: clothes, furniture, itself, and so it make it pretty annoying to thread the wires through clothing (e
g
to keep it from catching on anything)
It feels substantial, but is not functionally useful
The around-the-neck design does a good job of dampening cable noise to the far ear, but doesn't help with the close ear
The cable noise is definitely present as you jog or walk around
You can mitigate this by threading the cable through your clothing to minimize its movement
The worst is the wind noise
When jogging, it's like a pulsing jet of air is swishing by your ears
I found that when walking, I'd get this "woosh" "woosh" "woosh" in time with my steps
I don't walk that fast, guys, that I should be generating wind effects
Just forget about wearing these while track biking
It is tolerable, but this is what I expect from cheap earbuds
My old iPod earbuds (I used all the old versions, with and without rubber rims, remote control, etc) totally blow these out of the water
My old Skullcandy department store $6 earbuds performed just as well as these
And finally, after about two good weeks of use, a small exposed piece of cable caught on a doorknob because of the extreme "stickiness" of the cable and gave them a good yank
The cable wire detached from the stereo connector, and my $27 was gone
Great
Won't be getting these again
Pros:1
Over-the-neck earbud design relieves some cable-bounce noise and cable tension
2
Multiple earbud sizes is nice
I tried them all, stuck with the default medium size
3
When seated correctly, they do a great job of isolating external noise
Cons:1
Expensive for their sound quality
2
Cable noise is still an issue
Don't expect to job with these and have high-fidelity music
3
Wind noise is absurd
I get wind noise from just walking
4
All the advertisement about strong bass is hot air
They're no better than any other budget earbud
5
Absurdly "sticky" cables make threading through clothes difficult and make cable catch on just about everything
Conclusion:These earbuds are just fine
if they cost $10
They're really no better than any other cheap earbud and not worth the premium to have a Seinnheiser logo on them
I waited a few weeks before writing a review of these earbuds because I wanted to be sure I truly liked the sound, fit, comfort and overall quality
I have owned several different makes and models of earbuds from several different manufacturers, and the Sennheiser CX 300B is by far the best I have ever owned
Pros:1)  Excellent and comfortable fit
I was really apprehensive about the ability of these earbuds to stay in my ears while walking
I tried the different size supplied "collars", I settled on the large, and they have never moved or fallen out of my ears
Also, these earbuds have the right side earbud on a much longer wire than the left
This allows the user to run the wire behind the head
This is an excellent design feature as the stress of the wires will not pull the earbud out of your ear
2)  The sound
I realize one of the marketing features of this earbud is the enhanced bass
Do NOT let this scare you
I love accuracy over bass, and these earbuds have excellent and well balanced sound
Maybe the bass would be more pronounced if played at a higher DB, but loud volume is not my interest so I can't say
I like classic rock, jazz just about everything except rap and these earbuds, to my ears at least, sound open and more overall accurate than bassy
I guess if you are looking for earbuds that thump bass these may not satisfy
3)  The plug is designed with extra strength via plastic around the base plus it's curved to a right angle
I've had earbuds fail right at the plug araes due to stress during use
These earbuds are correctly engineered to minimise plug stress damage
4)  These earbuds come with a very nice carrying case that helps to protect the earbuds when not in use
5)  The price
For the money these are an outstanding value
Cons:1)  None
The performance of these earbuds is by FAR the best that I have heard
That being said, they are not without their flaws
They do great in the mid-range but highs and lows (bass) can, and often does, sound flat
I don't want to discourage anyone from purchasing these because they really are excellent for the price but for a true audiophile they will be a bit disappointing
Earbuds all suffer a bit on quality to enable the portability inherent to their super small size
Compared to over the ear cans that I have owned and tested over the years these simply cannot compete, but then again they are nowhere near the same price
Overall I think most people will be satisfied with them and I do like them they have their place and use, but remember they do have their limitations too
These earbuds were a bit more expensive than the skullcandy ones I had been using but I had heard good things about the Sennheiser products so I thought I'd try them out
I bought these and a pair of Audio Technica ATH M30 headphones
I didn't think I would notice much difference but man was I wrong
I can hear things in songs that I never even knew was there before
If you love your music like I do, it's definitely worth the investment
Now I know why a good amplifier is crucial
♪Enjoy
They are the few ear buds that fit comfortably and they arrived quickly
The sound is excellent and I love the fact that they can reach around the back of my neck and are out of the way
Surprisingly nice base and clean sound from a little earphone
I got it for $20 on sale and the only regret I have, that I didn't buy two of these
Tried more expensive earbuds/phones
were too fragile-broke or malfunctioned within a few months
so far, so good on these
reasonable cost and great sound
Just received this product
Enhanced bass
Not so
I think these buds are great for classical music, very clear, beautiful
But if you're listening to anything else, these buds are not for you
Seriously people, who gave this product 5 stars, what are you thinking
because some seemed to indicate some shortcomings in this product
However, I can attest that I cannot find any problem with the product
For one thing, the first thing I noticed was that the volume setting on my iPod is now about 30% less than it was with my old ear buds, which I believe I bought from Target about 3 years ago
So that shows this unit is either more efficient or perhaps higher quality on the buds themselves
(or both
)  Also, I really like how the buds fit in my ears
I had to remove the muffin covers it comes with as they were the medium sized ones, and install the larger sized ones it also came with
I stowed the medium and small sized muffins in the bag it comes with so they won't get lost
Here's what I noticed about the fit for my ears
First, because the buds are L-shaped, they do not hurt when I lay on my side in bed, listening to music to go to sleep by
My old ones were also L-shaped, but the insertion length was longer so it actually hurt to lay on my side
So that was a wonderful benefit that was unexpected as I prefer to side sleep
Second, I like how one ear bud wire is longer than the other
This allows me to wrap the excess around the back of my head, drape it over the other ear, and then run the parallel wires over to the iPod, which I slip under my pillow for safekeeping
My old unit, which has sticky wires almost identical in feel to this new one, (leading me to believe they also may be an older version of Sennheiser), I was expecting with the new unit to get the same wire noise I get with my old unit
Wire noise happens when the wires move on you when you shift in bed, and the sound amazingly gets magnified in your ears
Well, this Sennheiser unit, that was very minimized
That was a pleasant surprise
Finally, I like that the connector to the iPod is also L-Shaped, even though I rarely walk around with the iPod in my pocket, listening to music, as I like that the wire will not be stressed should I decide to do that on occasion
Oh, one complaint I noticed on another review was that the muffins are so airtight that some people complained of pressure in the ear as you push the buds in
I also noticed that a little bit on one ear, but not the other
Probably one ear is more symmetrical on the entrance than the other one
Anyway, I was able to alleviate the problem by squeezing on the muffin as I inserted it, so the air could escape
I purchased these to use at work while listening to music on my android phone
The different sizes of ear bud covers made it easy to find the one that worked in my ears to block outside sound
I have very sensitive ears and many ear buds are uncomfortable to me
These work great and are not uncomfortable
*Disclaimer - I'm in no way an audio professional
Read this review as if it is coming from just some guy who likes clear music and practicality
So, I bought these expecting an improvement over my Sony earbuds that I bought at Walmart, and to be honest, those Sony earbuds produced some great sound to start with (for their price)
So I was really only looking for a minor improvement, something with a little more clarity, especially in the high range
That isn't exactly what I got out of these earbuds
Don't get me wrong, the sound quality was good, but it wasn't good enough to make me want to buy these over my Sony pair
It sounds like they don't have as rich of highs as I was expecting
Mids and lows are rather nice, but it almost seems like "precision enhanced bass" is something that is meant to add more glitter to the product than anything
Bass tones are fine, but not punchy like I've heard from other earbuds at a comparable price
I would like to place a disclaimer though, I am comparing these, side by side, with the Sonys
After listening to them by themselves for awhile, this is all stuff you are unable to really pickup on
The fit of the earbuds isn't the greatest
The part of the earbud that is supposed to actually be inserted into the ear doesn't insert far enough before the cord gets in the way of the ear
It constantly feels like they are going to fall out, and they do from time to time
Now, I'm using the medium "cushions" (for lack of a better word) as the large don't fit in my ear, and when forced, don't produce a good sound
I would prefer the distance between the tip of the earbud and the cord to be greater, to give more room to accomodate the bottom of my ear
Regarding comfort, you can just barely tell they are in your ears
They are nice and soft, and after awhile, you just about forget you are wearing them (aside from fact that music doesn't just play out of thin air)
I will start off talking about the cord by stating that it is assymetrical, which I realize has its uses, but is not my preference, so that is a personal downside for me
It may not be for you
The cord is made out of a nice silicone-like material (if not silicone itself), which means it doesn't tangle all that much, and when it does, it is easy to untangle
I am not a fan of the plug
Yes, it props the cord at 90 degrees to the jack, which is nice, but the entire plug is big and bulky
I get the feeling that the only reason for that design is to fit the Sennheiser name on it
A nice touch, but I could definitely do without it in exchange for a smaller plug
The travel bag that comes with these earbuds is actually really nice
It is a leathery material that feels nice and soft, and has the Sennheiser logo printed on it in a glossy black
It is a really nice looking bag
The closing mechanism is pretty cool as well, not using any sort of latch or drawstring, but instead two strips of (what I assume to be) metal that act as springs, always wanting to stay in the closed position
They aren't hard to open, but will keep the earbuds safe inside
My only gripe with the bag is it seems like it almost takes three hands to get the earbuds in it; two hands to keep the spring mechanism open, and one hand to stuff the earbuds inside
Other than that, it is a pretty cool design
Overall, not bad earphones, but I don't think I would buy them over my Sony pair
They do hold a close 2nd place though, and easily outrank most other earphones at this price
These headphones were a huge disappointment
They are muddy across all frequency ranges
The highs are thin and not clear, the mids are hollow, and the bass is weak and does not have much presence
However, this is my evaluation after having used the Sennheiser cx500's for about 2 years
My cx500's broke, so I though I was getting a competent replacement
After the huge let-down with these, I purchased a set of Klipsch Image s-4's
While those were slightly better and more clear, they still do not match up to my old cx500's
My advice is do not touch these
Do yourself a favor
go on ebay and buy a set of cx500's for the same price
I have really been enjoying the quality of these buds
I don't usually take the time to review an item but this is warranted
Crisp bass especially with some comply foam tips, although the gel ones it comes with are not bad
Clear highs and mids, as well as a good sound stage for IEM earbuds
Off center main wire with a longer wire to the right ear is nice so the main wire doesn't run down the middle
I happen to like the design and the thicker rubber insulation around wire makes for less kinking
Right angle jack is always a nice bonus to avoid damage to the wire at that insertion
So why one star you ask
While the build quality out of the box seemed sturdy, the left but has no output now and i can't identify the source of the problem
I have tried moving around the wire at different points rotating in the jack and nothing will get a peep of a sound out of the left bud
I have owned s4i, audio technicas, and even lower no name brands
while the quality of the sound varies on all the models I have owned (and these were one of the better pairs in terms of sound quality
) these have lasted the shortest by far
Crappy chinese knock off iphone headphones that sound like junk have lasted longer than these ten-fold
My window for returning them or exchanging them has just expired as of 10 days before they broke, so these are as good as trash
Since I can't exchange these for free, I don't know if it was just this pair that was faulty (no headphones i have ever owned lasted not even 2 months)
Safe to say I won't buy from Sennheiser again when every other brand headphone I have bought of that caliber has yet to break - I'll stick with AT and Klipsch
Exceptionally good sound quality for the price
I owned a pair before but lost them, I tried a few other more expensive ear buds my friends owned but none measured up to these so I purchased another pair
After putting these ear-buds on I couldnt hear the usual office ambient noise
Sound quality is good and these ear phones are inexpensive
I would recommend these to my friends who are looking for ear-buds
This is my second time buying these headphones ( what can I say I lost them unfortunately)Upon realizing this I shot back through my orders for the past year and quickly picked up the same pair
The earbuds are brilliant,Pros:Awesome case4 extra rubber buds,best quality for the priceCons:Left headphone cable is a bit shorter than the right and I am not sure for what reason
These ear buds are the best i ever heard or uses
Great sounding bass and equals any Bose product at much lower price
I purchased these to replace my almost seven-year-old factory earbuds without knowing what to expect out of them
Frankly, I never cared about the sound quality of my earbuds--I only cared that I had some to use at school, in the gym, etc
You could only imagine my surprise when I broke open the packaging and listened to these for the first time
WOW
To say I was "impressed" is an enormous understatement
I honestly never thought that earbuds could sound THIS AMAZING
I was able to hear sounds that I did not even know were there, and I consider my hearing to be meticulous and in excellent standing due to the fact that I play the piano and guitar by hearing only
but that's beside the point
As far as music is concerned, I listen to a variety of musical styles ranging from hard-hitting EDM, to soulful jazz, to classical greats, and these earbuds have greatly enhanced my experience with all of them
They are simply superb
ThebBass, mid-range, and treble are all crystal-clear and distinguished, yet not to the extent that that they become harsh on the ears
For those who are looking for a set of earbuds that provide extraordinary sound, but at an economic price, these Sennheisers fill that niche perfectly
Now, it is important to note that I am writing this review with a "first impression" mindset as I have just received these in the mail
As amazed as I am with these earbuds out-of-the-box, I know that I will continue to become increasingly impressed as they start to burn-in
I honestly wish that I had found these earlier, because they really are an incredible set of earbuds
If you care more about sound and fit from your earphones then looks,  buy these
Musically these compare to earbuds costing 3x as much
And they are very sturdy, I've had mine for over 5 years and they are still going strong
Buy them
I compared these to altec Lansing mzx406 for less than half price
Bass and sound separation was far superior
I just needed to know how much better buds can be
These passed this test
However, the altec's had a much thicker cord wire
The wires on the altec's broke while at the gym
These have to be in the office or bedroom only
No way can I take these delicate instruments on my bike or gym
But they do sound great
Hope someone makes a good earbud that is durable
My third pair
Get a couple years of heavy use out of each pair
Use them to work out and on the go
Like most headphones they eventually stop working, but would always buy again
these arrived a day sooner then they said it would and i am glad to have a great backup set of headphones
Shipped on time and in proper condition as promised by the seller
Previously I used a Creative EP-630 and Sennheisers Sound quality is better
I feel like Bass is a little more emphasized
I dont like that factor but again that is a relative thing, some people like original bass, some like a little emphasized
The good part is that it comes with a lot of ear bud sizes, so it can fit almost anybody
In short, its good for the price, and  if you want a good reliable pair of in-ear headphones, for walking around, for the gym etc, go for it
:-)
only thing I have to complain about with these is the unequal length of the cord by the earbuds
love the bass level on these, makes me feel like I'm in a concert hall
Loving these earbuds, i like how they fit in my ears and the bass sounds pretty deep, for the price and quality, they are awesome
I  got these after breaking the  connector on another  set of noise reduction earphones
Obviously the other brand spent  more on marketing than tbey did building a good product
These are the best I've  owned
I purchased these to replace an old pair of SONY earbuds that had gone intermittent
All I can say is I wish I had done it sooner
The first thing I did was blow my ears off
These earbuds are at LEAST 50% more efficient than the old Sony ones
I primarily use these in my Samsung Galaxy-S with the MP3 player
And with the old buds, I was listening at "15 of 15" all the time, and they still were not loud enough
With the CX 300B
I listen at "10 of 15" or it is just too loud
Then there is the sonic quality
I have blown a LOT of money on Hi-Fi equipment over the years, and I know that things SHOULD sound like - but often do not
Again - completely blown away by these earbuds
Crisp, clean, clear
Well defined bass
These things sound as good as systems that cost thousands, if not 10s of thousands of dollars
The only thing they cannot do is give you the "feel" of the bass thumping your chest like full size speakers can
But they deliver on EVERYTHING ELSE
For $35
If you don't own a pair of these - RUN to your computer and get them on order
The the sound quality and the price, I just do not believe there is a better value in earbuds on the market today
The only minor thing for me, and it is minor, is the asymmetrical cord
I prefer equal length
Other than that, you cannot go wrong
I had a great deal on these earphones for about $23
The ear buds fit great in my ear and they never fall off unless I pull them off
I like the carrying pouch more than I love these earphones
It's a pouch that seals up through the magnetic lining
Most importantly, the sound quality is a great bargain if you pay less than $30
The bass is not amazing, but it is very good
I don't like that the headphones are short
If it were 6 inches longer it would have been the perfect length
I also didn't like that the left side ear bud is shorted than the right side
I wish all earphones had the same lengths on both sides
Caution - only received them yesterday
But given that, I have used Sennheiser headphones in studio environments for many years, but due to my rough handling of mobile equipment I have never spent much money on earbuds, and I didn't spend much on these, but oh, my goodness, what a sound in such a small package
Sound separation is subperb, if anything, the enhanced bass may be a bit too much, but who's complaining
And here's the cool part: Sennheiser's equipment always has to be broken in for about 30 days before you hear the best
Can't wait
Amazon was fast, fast, fast
Unit arrived in Sennheiser factory sealed packaging, so its the real deal
Highly recommend for any music lover
I'm CONSTANTLY untangling the cord
I put it down and pick it up a minute later and it's in a knot
Make that knots
This can be extremely annoying
Sound quality is nothing special either, so I suggest not investing in these
I bought these as a replacement for what I thought were also CX 300B headphones
They must have different models within each line of headphone
These earbuds sound terrible
The bass is nonexistent and when volume is raised to compensate, the highs irritate my ears
Furthermore, the cord length for the left and right earphone are not equal
This causes the cable to hang down one side of your body, which works when you're wearing a t-shirt but FAILS in practice when you're wearing a coat
The splitter in the cord gets all caught in the coat's collar while you walk
DO NOT BUY THESE
I've had much better experiences with Sennheiser products
I love this product, it is better than i expected, the sound is so clear even with the deep bass, i like how they fit nice in my ears, and the little bag, nice detail to carry the accesories
the headphones are amazing, the sound is clear and the bass i awesome
my only problem with them is that the left side is shorter than the right side
these are great earphones for the price i have only previously owned the jvc xx which are great too but these blow them away great buy
I like these ear buds better than my old Apple ones
Nice thing about the Apple ones is the pause button on the cable
I use this for a nano so have to manually pause it
Ive owned two of these the past 4 years
(had to buy a second pair when my first god chewed by my dog) I couldn't recomend a better mid range earphones
Getting my 3rd pair today
I like bass to feel like it is punching through all the crud in the world straight into my heart to deliver a primal injection of the celebration of life
This isn't quite there, but if my heart was centered in my brain instead of my chest, it would be
Highly satisfactory bass reproduction, especially if used with any device with a respectable equalizer
I have Power Amp for my Android phone, and the two make a great team to lubricate my life through tough times
The cord is sturdy, springy, rubbery; easy to untange compared to any other headphones I've used
Noise cancelling is primo; actually works to well, as I've 5 kids, including a newborn, and am totally def to the outside world when I've got my jams going
The carrying pouch, while working well enough, looks a little cheap, as the stitching is slightly crooked
It took about 4 days before it started sounding really clean, but now its da bomb-dot-com
I bought these for my 13 yr old son who wanted another brand that was popular (beats
) and $100
He preferred  the sound quality over the ipod earbuds he had and was glad I got quality instead of the "popular" brand
They sound great and he likes the way they fit etc
I've had lots of headphones over the years and I continue to return to this brand because they just work for my lifestyle
My earbuds need to be able to take a beating
I hate that many earbuds lose sound in one side after a couple of uses
I've never had this problem with the Sennheiser brand and I'm thankful
I wear these in the sauna, for running, and other high intensity workouts
I also use them at work
I endorse this product
Very base heavy headphones, very good quality for this price
Can be difficult to understand what people are saying in VOIP's though
Earbuds are generally comfortable but can be difficult to position in ear, creating unbalanced sound
One cord to a bud is longer than the other (makes telling right from left easier)
There is a LOT of cord which can be difficult to store/handle if not careful/meticulous
Case that comes with the product is a bit small for the large cord size
Do not use these headphones if you want no one to sneak up on you
This is my 3rd pair of the cx300
The first from ebay turned out to be a fake
Both pairs from Amazon were the real deal
I have tried many other earbuds
These are easily the best sounding I have owned (including the Klip image s4)
Sound is smooth and clear and base is excellent
They are also very comfortable to wear
The first pair from amazon lasted about two years of heavy use
I was pretty rough on them about 4 days a week at the gym so no deduction here
The wire on this model is very thin but they held up pretty well for me, as another reviewer said they are not great for running ( try the mee m6 for running)
Overall I love the sound from these buds
I tried more expensive models but I always come back to my cx300
The asymetrical cable drives me crazy
I hate it
Also if you want killer bass - you're not going to hear that
Otherwise reasonably comfortable
Best earbuds I have owned to date - but they leave me wanting more
I haven't tried anything more expensive yet but have tried many less expensive and none of those compare
These were purchased as a gift, and the recipient was delighted with the "buds"
Once he got the correct size ear piece he was astonished with the fabulous sound
Good buy for the money
But not as good as the previous pair of Sennheiser earbuds I owned
Unfortunately they were no longer made
All in all, very good sound for their size
I'm not one to spend a lot on elitist earbuds although I like a nice quality earbud
These were very reasonably priced and are the best earbuds I've ever owned
I'm impressed by the quality and I'm happy with the purchase
They are great they are The BEST earbuds I've ever tried my father and I bought last week 2 pairs of buds and they came today in the morning and now I've heard a lot of songs and they sound great and the bass enchanter thing is awesome
I love them
Buy them they are great
These are my first in ear buds, and I must say I am blown away by their sound quality and relative inexpensive price
I've been using open-back, on ear KOSS portapro phones which I do love, and these compare very favorably to them
Pros:-Excellent sound: bass response is nothing short of amazing, and the sound is well balanced and full of detail
-Comfortable in the ear-The asymmetrical chord of the right earbud is in-fact a GREAT idea in my opinion - when you put the left earbud in as usual (from the front) and then take the right bud behind the neck to the right ear, it enables you to simply take one of the buds out when you want to, and just "let it hang" on your shoulder while the other one stays in the ear without budging
This prevents from the chords from entangling and worse, dropping the tiny things to the floor and stepping on them or soiling them
genius
-choice of rubber seals - I found you need the largest your ears can fit to get the best bass response and detail from these, as well of course as noise attenuation
-quality pouch
-metal mesh inside to prevent ear wax from entering the drivers
Cons:-Some chord noise while walking enters the ears, as well as wind noise
However, after a while it stops bothering me
As for the sound, it is less open or "airy" when compared to my open-back, sound leaking KOSS portapros, but the sound makes up for it in spades in detail and warm, accurate bass
Also of note, these do not go inside the ear canal as some do (like a pair of etymotics I once had for example) and sit right on the opening of the ear canal sealing it with the big rubber seal
No need to try and shove them in the ear painfully
They're a delight
Highly recommended
Haven't had them very long to test their durability, but the sound is great
Item I purchased did not come with a case for the headphones
Good overall reproduction of music
Not as good as I had hope in shutting out outside noise
For the price a good choice
I purchased these to use at work while listening to music on my android phone
The different sizes of ear bud covers made it easy to find the one that worked in my ears to block outside sound
I have very sensitive ears and many ear buds are uncomfortable to me
These work great and are not uncomfortable

I have tried moving around the wire at different points rotating in the jack and nothing will get a peep of a sound out of the left bud
I have owned s4i, audio technicas, and even lower no name brands
while the quality of the sound varies on all the models I have owned (and these were one of the better pairs in terms of sound quality
) these have lasted the shortest by far
Crappy chinese knock off iphone headphones that sound like junk have lasted longer than these ten-fold
My window for returning them or exchanging them has just expired as of 10 days before they broke, so these are as good as trash
Since I can't exchange these for free, I don't know if it was just this pair that was faulty (no headphones i have ever owned lasted not even 2 months)
Safe to say I won't buy from Sennheiser again when every other brand headphone I have bought of that caliber has yet to break - I'll stick with AT and Klipsch
Exceptionally good sound quality for the price
I owned a pair before but lost them, I tried a few other more expensive ear buds my friends owned but none measured up to these so I purchased another pair
After putting these ear-buds on I couldnt hear the usual office ambient noise
Sound quality is good and these ear phones are inexpensive
I would recommend these to my friends who are looking for ear-buds
This is my second time buying these headphones ( what can I say I lost them unfortunately)Upon realizing this I shot back through my orders for the past year and quickly picked up the same pair
The earbuds are brilliant,Pros:Awesome case4 extra rubber buds,best quality for the priceCons:Left headphone cable is a bit shorter than the right and I am not sure for what reason
These ear buds are the best i ever heard or uses
Great sounding bass and equals any Bose product at much lower price
I purchased these to replace my almost seven-year-old factory earbuds without knowing what to expect out of them
Frankly, I never cared about the sound quality of my earbuds--I only cared that I had some to use at school, in the gym, etc
You could only imagine my surprise when I broke open the packaging and listened to these for the first time
WOW
To say I was "impressed" is an enormous understatement
I honestly never thought that earbuds could sound THIS AMAZING
I was able to hear sounds that I did not even know were there, and I consider my hearing to be meticulous and in excellent standing due to the fact that I play the piano and guitar by hearing only
but that's beside the point
As far as music is concerned, I listen to a variety of musical styles ranging from hard-hitting EDM, to soulful jazz, to classical greats, and these earbuds have greatly enhanced my experience with all of them
They are simply superb
ThebBass, mid-range, and treble are all crystal-clear and distinguished, yet not to the extent that that they become harsh on the ears
For those who are looking for a set of earbuds that provide extraordinary sound, but at an economic price, these Sennheisers fill that niche perfectly
Now, it is important to note that I am writing this review with a "first impression" mindset as I have just received these in the mail
As amazed as I am with these earbuds out-of-the-box, I know that I will continue to become increasingly impressed as they start to burn-in
I honestly wish that I had found these earlier, because they really are an incredible set of earbuds
If you care more about sound and fit from your earphones then looks,  buy these
Musically these compare to earbuds costing 3x as much
And they are very sturdy, I've had mine for over 5 years and they are still going strong
Buy them
Bought this as a gift for a friend, so I have no idea how they are working
He hasn't complained at all though
If you were in my position, you wanted a good pair of in-ear headphones but didn't feel like spending a ton
This hits the top of the bell curve of price/quality and I highly recommend them
The sound is solid across the board, and after a good burn in they sound excellent
They don't leak and do a decent enough job on the noise cancelling, but nothing amazing
The bass is neither overwhelming (as in it takes away from the mids/highs) or under-powered- as long as you actually give these some power aka turn the volume up, that's where they shine
For the price point, they replaced a Sony pair that I liked for the same reasons, and these are an improvement
The little bag they come with is fine, won't protect them from getting smashed or anything though
Good quality for the price
They are the earbuds I use watching movies on my Kindle Fire HD
Definitely would reccomend them
Ok, my previous review was all about how these earbuds lacked bass
I found that by going up a size with the in ear attachments, this problem went away
Now these sound just as great as advertised which makes me very happy
I've noticed that any cord vibrations are very noisy as the sound is transmitted straight into your ear
My old earbuds just sat on the surface of the ear, but because these actually go inside your ear, sound is transmitted up the cords
Also, I'm not a fan of having the cord size longer for one ear
This makes them too tight on one ear and too loose on the other
I don't like this design in general but many earbuds have this same "feature" now
Other than that, they work fine and the sound is GREAT
I have narrow ear canals & have had nothing but disappointment when trying earbuds bought at local retailers
This set has adjustable silicon pieces that make fitting the earbuds into my ears possible
The music is clearer in quality AND much more enjoyable since I do not have to worry about my ears hurting
Very glad that a friend of mine suggested these
Not the best headphones I've used but they are pretty good
Much richer sound than ipod/iphone earbuds
I listen to punk rock so the bass boost is not so necessary, but it still enhances the music so overall I'm pretty happy with these earbuds
I actually listened to a few trans/house songs on them and it sounds pretty awesome
Because they comes with 3 ear bud rubber things they fit a lot better than any other earbuds that I have tried
Since they have a snugger fit, they do cancel out background noise rather well
Perfect for commutes on the train
I'll keep it short and simple, I loved my Klipsch IMAGE S4s, they broke after a year of use (which is a record tbh for me as I usually break earphones in 1 month) but these CX300B sound better, louder (way way louder) and have great fit on my ears
The also seem more durable than the Klipsch S4s
Good thing the were on sale and bought two
Was looking for a decent pair of ear-buds and these are more than I had bargained for
Excellent value and great sound quality
very good qualitty for i -phons or i-phod sound is graet light and usefull very good product i enjoy it
They sound good
Mine last about 5 years of every day use
J cord goes around back of neck
OK
The sound reproduction is great
Unfortunately I cannot use this when I have a music device in my pocket as the cord prevents the buds from reaching my ears
These earphones sound decent, but the plug broke after the 3rd time I used them
The gold plug fell out if the plastic housing
I have owned many earphones and I have never had this type of failure
Great bass and overall sound *if* you can get a good seal
I'm getting by with the large cushions for now
If I press them in the sound improves massively, but they won't stay (tried all 3 sizes)
Meanwhile, I've ordered some "tri-level" replacement ear cushions which I hope will fix up a couple pairs of in-ear headphones
I have some "cone-style" earplugs from Howard Leight (similar to Howard Leight FUS30-HP ) that work great; don't know why all in-ear headphones don't come with that design
Update: The replacement cushions I got work great
6 pairs Lostearbuds Brand Tri-Level, Replacement Ear Cushions, Earbuds for Sound Isolating Earphones Size SMALL, They fit over 50 types, will fit 4
0mm to 6
5mm diameter speaker hole
Five stars for the modified sound, minus one star for the lame stock cushions
I bought these for my son
His last pair of Sennheiser wore out
This pair is updated and very nice
The case is handy and just rite size
Came everything as expected
Fast
Gave them as a gift and recipient loved them
This is a nice pair of headphones
I love these headphones
They cost more, but are well worth it
they don't come out of my ears when I'm running
Sound is great
so good，i like it，the sound is great，and it is inexpensive hereif i need more earbuds，i will choice Sennheiser！good
First thing to say is that it comes in great packaging
When I opened them, they had a great feel to them before I even plugged them in
The wire is slightly rubberized, I like it
It is less rubberized than the Klipsch Image s4 chord, but it isn't plasticy like other inexpensive headphones
I am buying these to take to the gym because I don't want to break my Image s4's
I love Klipsch, I'd say it is better audio-wise by a slight margin, the CX300's are slightly too bass-heavy for me, some people love it though
Considering that I payed $30 for these and that my Image s4's cost double, this is the best pair I've seen in the price-range
If you don't want to spend the money on Image s4's, this is great
If you want more durability than the Image s4's, these are also great
Again I'd like to say the bass is a bit much
The headphones come with a great case, it is soft and opens in a cool way, fun to play with
It isn't as solid as the Image s4's aluminum case, but then again, these headphones can manage without the aluminum case
Also I'd like to say that the headphone itself feels a bit too light and plasticy, good for the gym, but just doesn't feel as durable as the wire of the cable for some off reason
The headphones come with 3 pairs of ear-bud tips, the shape of them is unique to the Sennheiser's and won't fit on other headphones
Also I have to say that my Klipsch double-flanged tips fit me better, I am using the smallest pair that came with the CX300's right now
One issue is that I wanted to put other ear-bud tips on these headphones, but they will not fit as Sennheiser has a unusually large driver to put the tip on
The highs and mids do get weaker in the CX300s as the bass is so strong, not a problem with the Image s4's
Another piece of info is that the right ear cable is longer than the left, I can deal with that, but many people don't like it
To be clear, if you don't need durability
buy the Image s4's-and now they are around $45, you can also get a refurbished pair for $30(Ocean Reef Electronics on Amazon if you can, I've bought them before, they're basically new)
If you want some durability, this is the best sound for the price
Other than this, there's a heavy bass pair of $9 Sonys that I love, they are sorta disposable, okay to lose yaknow
BEST UNDER $10- Sony MDR-ED12LPBEST UNDER $50- Sennheiser CX 300B MK IIBEST UNDER $100- Klipsch Image s4/s4i/s4aIf you're the audiophile under a budget, this should be your list
Again, I haven't burned them in much yet, and I haven't extensively taken to the gym, I hope I remember to come back to update
3 MONTH UPDATE:Work exactly the same as when I bought them- unlike the Klipsch Image s4s which began to short out as a result of constant use at the gym
These are very durable and the only pet peeve for me is the cable being two different lengths for the left and right ears
me gusto el producto, lo que  mostro la foto, sin problema en la entrega,  compra satisfactoria producto en buena calidad
Great sound, nice bass and well worth the money
The cord is too rubbery and tends to get tangled very easily
which is my only real compaint
These headphones are great
they produce great noise and seal in the sound so you cannot hear much of anything outside
Some problems I have is getting used to the loop on the back of the head to put on earphones
Also, I find it annoying how sometimes the earbud that goes around the back of your head falls out because the wire may pull the it, causing a shift in weight of the two earbuds
BUT OVERALL FANTASTIC
Just upgraded from cheap earbuds to this
Everything improved, sound and bass all together
Great product, still getting used to the asymmetrical cord however
I bought these hoping they'd be a bit better quality
They fit the ears perfectly and do a great job of cancelling out background noise (so much so that I've missed a few phone calls) but to me, they don't live up to the Sennheiser name
The cord noise is unbearable, especially as a runner
The only way to combat this is to pull the headphone cord behind my head
I have a feeling that's what these were made for as suddenly, the left ear bud being on a significantly shorter cord makes a bit more sense
For future, I'd opt to go with full ear headphones from Senn
Those have yet to fail me or my expectations and remain closer to the HiFi quality I'd come to expect from Senn
Great sound
Great noise attenuation
Excellent low and high frequencies response
Best performance on this price range
Carrying bag could be better
I purchased these to replace a pair of Sony MDR-EX56 headphones that served long and well
I did not find these to be as comfortable as the Sony's they replaced, I also didn't prefer the tone quality
I have used these earbuds on an iPhone 4 as well as a few SanDisk Sansa MP3 players
I always use either high bit-rate MP3s or VBR MP3's
In the end, I ended up purchasing a pair of Sony MDR-EX210 earbuds which I LOVE
Again, nothing against these earbuds
People's personal taste in headphones/earbuds is a large factor
These just weren't for me
I bought these earphone in november and after two months of use the left earbud is silent
Interestingly this has happened with both Senn and Nu-force phones I had purchased off of Amazon
Seems to be a defect in the design/contruction of the product which the manufactureres need to address
I have heard this is a frequent complaint
Oherwise excellent buy for the sound quality and price
Hope I can garner a replacement from Senn
Nu force had replaced them but the new ones also died after a few months
I bought these for a Christmas gift
This is the pair asked for
great sound quality
Now I want a pair for myself
Good price and high quality earbuds that lives up to the Sennheiser name, an item that anyone with handheld music devices should have
These are my second set of Sennheiser earbuds and I'm even happier with these as they are the extra bass models
The sound quality is clean and clear and the bass is tight and punchy
I almost expect the actually "feel" the base with I listen to certain songs
I hope these last at least as long as my last pair, 1 year
The earbuds are good for the price
Comes with extra buds to fit comfortably
Bass is decent
Overall a good pair of earphones for its price

You know it's Sennheiser
Their products always impressed me with excellent sound quality
This CX 300 II really kicks what it stated for; precision bass enhanced
The bass might not be as heavy as those bass oriented Beats earbuds but the as I hear the bass rocking I also hear every other sound
Comfort: 9
5/10Sound: 9/10Bass: 9/10Ambient Bass: 10/10Material: 8
5/10Design: 8/10Another good stuff
I owned CX 680i and HD 380 Pro
This was to be my second set of the CX 300 series earbuds
I loved the first ones - sound quality was great, they were light and very comfortable
I was fully expecting generation II to be as good if not better
Unfortunately Sennheiser made a huge mistake with the plug design
Most headphone plugs are a tight right angle so the plug fits tightly against the device and doesn't protrude far
Sennheiser decided for some reason that the 'body' of the plug should extend about 3/4 - 1" (sorry don't have a ruler at the airport)
This does a few things:-  Makes whatever device you plug it into about an inch taller-  Very easy to bump and spin the plug now since it sticks out so far - often resulting in static noiseI have no idea why Sennheiser thought this was a good idea
I've owned about 20 sets of ear buds and cannot fathom any reason why this design makes sense
I'm no audiophile but I am picky about the quality of sound I'm listening to
These earbuds take a few days, maybe more, to burn in but once they do they deliver a nice range of sounds all across the board
While less punchy than Skullcandy earbuds these deliver enough to satisfy me
The cord was a little short for my liking, on the left ear, but otherwise these are great
Note that these ARE A-symmetrical, meaning the right ear has a longer cord than the left which is meant to be wrapped behind your head as opposed to the front
Great build quality and sound for around $30
Very small but the fit is good
not great but good enough, especially under a stocking hat while Nordic skiing
Bass at times may be too much and is not natural
Highs are good, but not natural
Sure ear buds have better sound, fit and build quality, but cost more
The Sennheiser delivers more than I have expected even if it is cheap
It really hits the bass so I am satisfied
Although at some point when the song have high trebles, the trebles really stands out that I need to minimize the volume so it wont be irritating
Clear highs, deep lows, overall these headphones are great
The left end of the earphone cord is shorter than the right, which I found annoying at first
I am used to it now and it is really no big deal
These earbuds do take some time to burn in and their sound will be best after several dozen hours of playing music through them
These earbuds have excellent sound quality - we purchased through Amazon to get the 2 year warranty
One side is longer on the cord for you to put behind your head, and then down the side
SOUND:These headphones are marketed as 'Bass Enhanced,' but the bass is standard, maybe even a bit sub par
That is, until you set your EQ to Bass Booster
Then it sounds nearly perfect, not too overpowering, and creating a nice ambient soundstage while giving the beat a solid backbone
The mids and highs are a bit too bright, but I haven't burned in the buds yet
Overall good sound quality though, more than competitive for a headphone of this price
HARDWARE:The build quality is solid and doesn't feel cheap or plasticky
However, the cord is very thin
This fits in its theme of a low-profile, discrete listening device
The product is very inconspicuous and discrete, which I like
Not seeing many uses for the assymetrical cord, but its not detracting from anything either
The 90* jack is always a plus point, and the Sennheisers have it
The complimentary carrying bag is surprisingly well made, with suede-leather and a magnetic opening
TL;DR - Good sound quality, great bass without being overpowering
Solid build quality
Good value for the 30 bucks
I got my first iPod in 2004, and, realizing how awful the Apple ear buds were, quickly acquired a pair of Sony in-ear buds so I could better enjoy my music
That pair expired in Nov
2008, so I got a new pair of Sonys then
Almost like clockwork, that pair expired four years later
I don't know if four years is a reasonable lifespan for ear buds, with heavy usage and usually stuffing them (indelicately) in my laptop bag when done with them
In any event, I sought some advice from friends, and one who does audio production in Hollywood thought these from Sennheiser should do the trick
At first, it seemed he was dead wrong
The sound just wasn't quite right, and the right ear bud just didn't feel good in my ear
I was even on the verge of trying to send them back
Before doing so, however, I tried other adapters/tips for the right ear
I swear I did this when I first got it, and stuck with the medium size as I always had
But
turns out for the right ear (strangely, just the right), the large size works best
After realizing this, these buds are true keepers
The bass is solid and full without being overwhelming, the midranges are clear and clean, and the top is vibrant
I listen to a lot of live music (bootlegs are wonderful things) and these handle live music very well, not to mention studio recordings
Wonderful sound quality
The little pouch included with the buds is handy
as I use that and treat the buds with a little more care, they should last longer than four years (I hope)
Don't hesitate to try these
The quality is very very good, and at this price, the value is hard to beat
I have not tried the expensive high end earbuds and because these sound so good I won't have to
Totally satisfied with the quality of sound these produce
And the price is phenominal
Thanks for all the research/input of an earlier review I gave these a try and still can't figure out why they are so cheap
Or are the others just overpriced
Quite simply, these earbuds are blowing me away
They are the best sounding pair of earbuds I've ever tried
The sound is amazingly full, and the bass is so deep and rich that it's hard to believe it's coming out of a small pair of earbuds
The box advertises these buds as having the following qualities: Noise-isolating, precise, and enhanced bass
In my opinion:Noise-isolating: Very good job, once you put on the proper size bud tip
I haven't tried them in very noisy environments (like an airplane or a subway), but in medium noise environments, I hear nothing but music at even moderate volume levels
Precise: Absolutely
It's sounds cliched, but I'm defiantly hearing parts of songs I've never heard before
Acoustic guitars sound crystal clear, which I think is a good indicator of precision
Enhanced Bass: No question about it
MASSIVE bass for an earbud
Overall, I think this product is great for all types of music (I've tried it with Rock, Metal, Rap, Trance, House, Acoustic, Pop, etc
), but it really shines with any music that features prominent bass (rap, electronica) or clear notes (not metal)
Highly recommended for the price
Update: After using these for a while, I have one complaint - the cord
For some reason, the cord for the left earbud is shorter than that for the right
Also, the cord tangles way too easily
If I could give these earbuds a 4
5 out of 5 I would, but due to their awesome sound, I'll leave the rating at 5
Really like the sound quality of these earbuds
Only minor complaint is that the cord is very fine and has the ability to tangle a bit easily (but show me a pair that doesn't
)
As a rating for the actual quality itself: 4 1/2 stars
The product does everything claimed
As for the actual headphones
2 stars
The pair I received in the mail today were terrible
The headphones were fine, but the appearance wasn't
The right ear bud chord length was almost double the left ear bud length
As for someone like me whom is highly OCD, this drove me nuts after about 2 minutes
I couldn't stop focusing on the chord length and enjoy my damn music
Hopefully if you buy these, yours is different
Only think what is valued is headset storage bagHeadset no microphone and tuning key,Acoustics generalAppearance commonBlack, be able to bear or endure dirty
For most people these will sound fine plugged straight into your mp3 player, and for $32 price matched at my local retailer i wasnt expecting much
I am an audiophile
Huge sound snob
I own DAC's and Tube amplifiers i typically use with high end cans
Some of those high-end cans are Sennheiser, and i have always loved the brand
With that said
I bought these for all the times I dont want a massive set of earphones on or dont want to carry a amp around
I plug them into a ipod mini
These sound comparable to headcandy in-ear phones except they are brighter
Too bright
After 72 hours of beating them in at max volume on a 5w class-a mosfet tube amp they were still too bright
Not nearly as bad as they were when i first tried them, but still very annoying on anything with a high hat
I bought these based on the "S4 Killer's" review and i regret my decision
The worst part about these is the cord
You would swear it's coated in adhesive the way it sticks to clothing
They are constantly being pulled out of my ears while moving around
Extremely frustrating and what made them end up in the trash
I do not reccomend these headphones for anyone active
Doesnt matter how cheap they are for decent sounding headphones, it's not worth the frustration
Honestly the fact that the cord is the way it is on the second revision of these headphones makes me seriously doubt where sennheiser is headed
They have done really poor things in the past, like charging literally 2 times the money for the same headphone where the only difference is baffling material inside the enclosure
The cheaper ones have the baffle
so they actually cost the manufacture more to produce
Hope they get it together and go back to being awesome
I use these mother effers non stop
I am still on my first set of earbud rubber things but they give you another pair (maybe even two, I never have to use them)
I run with them constantly and they always stay in my ears, even when I'm sweating profusely
Plus they have the one headphone with the longer string so you can wrap it around the back of your neck and you don't get it hanging down in front of you and bouncing around
Great sound, great execution
In less then six months these the end of the ear bud that goes to the jack was messed up where I could only hear one side
I attempted to return it to Sennheiser via their return system and they shipped the product back to me without replacing it or repairing the jack
I've had them for about 6 months now and haven't regretted buying them once
Just now  i am starting to hear static, i've heard it twice for like half a second but they have undergone heavy usage
One thing that's different than the description and the box is the Hertz, On here it shows to be like 42hz-17,000hz, But according to the box they are 19hz-21,000hz
Thats a good thing by the way
I use my earbuds everyday
I've used all types previsouly, and have historically spent a lot of money on earbuds/headphones
These deliver $100+ sound for $35
Great dynamic range, fits in the ear snug
I use these biking too work, running and working out and rarely have the buds fallen out
Also, I take these everywhere
They hold up well over time, but my only minor complaint would be durability
The cords are not really well protected, but they do hold up pretty well
My last pair of these got a bit clogged with earwax, but still performed admirablyPros: quality of sound is very good, low cost, good range, lightweight, great fit
Cons: durability isnt great, but good enough
Just placed and order for my 4th pair over MANY years
I always come back to these headphones
I use them for working-out so they take a good beating
The sound and fit are great, especially for this price range
I will add, I went to school for audio engineering so my ears are well trained; these buds are winners
I love these earbuds
They have great sound and are more durable than more expensive models
I have owned cheap Sony's (~$30), expensive Moda's (~$100) and even more expensive Shure's (~$130) and I like these Sennheiser's the best
To give you a little background, I use my earbuds with my ipod on my daily commute
The insulation on the wiring of the Sony's started to fray within 3 months
The connection at the actual earbud itself broke on the Moda's with A MONTH
The Shure's were the most durable, which eventually broke at the connection to the earbud as well after a little over a year
However, the sound quality on the Shure's were not as good as the Sennheiser
Again, I did not spring for the $200 model of the Shure's, which I'm sure has much better sound quality
These Sennheiser's held up for about 2 years and I'm buying the same model to replace my broken ones
I highly recommend these
I found these headphones to be a good value
Would be a good upgrade to some of the cheap headphones that are included with some mp3 players
I'll mention right from the start that I am by no means an audiophile
I purchased these to replace some of the stock Apple earbuds that you receive with an iPhone
As a consultant I travel a great deal and wanted something that was easy to pack and carry, sounded nice and was comfortable to wear on flights
Due to this criteria I really wasn't interested in the larger headphones as I have enough "stuff" to travel with as it is
These earbuds have proven to be much more comfortable than the Apple earbuds ever were, both the older versions and the new versions available with the iPhone 5
With multiple tip sizes to choose from it was simply a matter of trial and error to find the ones I liked the most (small)
The travel bag also makes them easy to wrap and stuff away quickly into my backpack
They take up minimal room and are extremely light
The sound is very good to me
But again I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination
In a simple comparison to my Apple earbuds the difference seemed quite drastic
It was almost like the sound coming from the Apple buds was an echo from the Sennheisers
It was quite remarkable
I've had these a few months now and still enjoy them greatly
They're holding up very well
I did a lot of on-line research for comfortable, affordable, and good sounding earbuds and picked these
They are everything the previous reviewers said they would be
I loved these earbuds up until the moment I lost them
I will be buying another pair as soon as my "back-ups" Klipsch S4 give out
Update: Yes, I bought another pair
Very happy with these
The earbuds arrived in what appeared to be beautiful factory packaging, but from there it was all downhill
Th extra earpieces were not in the package, which I could live with, or without
But the line that goes to the left ear was too short and the right line was twice as long
Worst of all, I had bought a $5 pair at a discount store to use until I could get these ordered, and the Sennheisers only sound marginally better
Is it possible that these are imitations or factory seconds
If I had bought these locally I would have taken them back, but it is not worth the hassle otherwise
I have had Sennheiser portables before that were excellent in quality so would not judge all of their products by these
After trying several lower dollar headphones, I stepped up to these
The fit is comfortable, and I use the buds it comes with
For those with different sized ears, there are other buds you can use to get a better fit
The most impressive (and probably important) attribute is the sound quality
This isn't necessarily audiophile quality sound here, but these headphones provide fantastic bass
No more hollow sounding tunes for me
One feature I really like about these headphones is how well they muffle sounds from around you
If I have them in and no music is playing, it really is hard to hear conversations around you (I'm using this in a cubicle environment)
With music playing, I generally can't hear people (so to get my attention you have to get in my line of sight, or email me, lol)
I find this beneficial, because it allows me to block out distractions and focus on work
As far as comfort; I've worn these only for a max of an hour or two at a time, but with no issues as far as comfort is concerned, and I'm confident I could go on wearing them much longer
Bottom line; great sound for the money
Sure, you can get 10% better sound for 100% more money, but you're at the point of diminishing returns then
If I didn't toss and turn so much in my sleep, I'd sleep with these in
They are comfy and sound amazing
Second pair of headphones that weren't skullcandy pairs or UE and these were awesome
The enhanced bass actually delivers pretty well
I also dropped them on the streets while walking to class and I eventually found them the next day on the street and they definitely had been run over by multiple cars but the metal ring help up pretty well and they work fine
Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I didn't know they were the ones with different cord lengths on each side but it's not too bad
They stay in pretty well when I run
Overall, sound is awesome and super durable apparently
Totally worthwhile
It's very comfortable
I had a hard time finding the right earphone, but this one totally works
I recommend it very much
I bought two of these because the last one I had the right earphone stopped working after a couple months, the two I recieved where terrible, after reading these reviews I think they might be fake, mine were sold by amazon itself
I kept one pair in the package because I figured I'd return them but the one I did open and try the right ear was ALREADY barely even audible
The left is normal volume, this means that in order to hear music properly I have to blast my left ear
not acceptable
I have had numerous other senheisser earphones that were AWESOME
hence why I keep trying these, not sure if I received fakes or not but something is up with this model, avoid
I've had these earbuds for a couple of months and they have not broken like other cheap earbuds might
They have reasonable sound quality
They are behind the head earbuds
My personal opinion is that I was pleasantly surprised when I used this product
The sound is very good, the base is much stronger like they advertise, and the ear buds are the comfortable I have ever used
my complaints:highly microphonic -- the slightest brush or lightest bump of cord against clothing is loudly transmitted to the ears
yes, this behavior is characteristic of this type of earphone, but these are significantly worse than other pairs I have owned
it is true that placing the longer cord behind the neck reduces this problem somewhat, but just not enough
highly microphonic 2 -- I happened to walk in front of an operating table-top fan set at medium speed
the noise of that modest air movement past the earphones swamped the music being played
it would seem these earphones would be unusable for walking or running outdoors in any conditions but absolutely calm winds (and ignoring cord movement)
difficult insertion -- of all the pairs of earphones I have owned, these are the most difficult to insert
in order to get a complete seal from external noise and get full sound reproduction, they feel as if they must inserted much farther into the ear than I am used to
also, as noted by others, the air pressure resulting from the deep insertion can be uncomfortable and there appears to be no method for relieving that pressure
large audio jack -- as noted by others, the jack is quite large and bulky
compared to 4 other mobile headphone jacks I have handy, this jack appears to be 50% larger and sticks out from the music player much farther (11/16ths of an inch) versus 7 to 9/16ths for those others measured
perhaps this complaint is a nit, but its impact is magnified by the other inadequacies of these earphones
yes, these earphones sound quite good
although, I did have to boost the high end on my music player in order to achieve some balance with the seemingly base-heavy sound
I succumbed to all the rave reviews and did not pay enough attention to the others who voiced these same complaints
these are only adequate as a backup pair of earphones
I am still looking for a quality pair of in-ear phones that are easy to insert and comfortable for extended periods, that minimize the microphonic tendencies of the cords, and that produce reasonable quality sound with a reasonably flat frequency response
is this possible in the sub-$100 price range
in the sub-$150 range
If you're looking at the 300Bs
You've probably already done your homework
If you're like me, you've been  contemplating on the S4i's or these
I'm not going to you with a subjective review but there are my personal pluses and minuses:Plus:Balanced sound compared to the "Beats" type IEM'sSmooth top endSlight "bump" in the lowest octave, but not muddyGREAT PRICEMinus:Cord tends to tangleBuild quality not as great as the S4i II
For $35 you can't go wrong
By the way, the DO REQUIRE BURN IN TIME
The first hour or two they were terrible
Tinny, hard mid range, and cruddy on the bottom end
After 4 hours of looping MP3's
WOW
12 Hours later
Sooo glad I bought these
Originally I was put off with my purchase because the left ear bud length is substantially less than the right ear bud
I thought this was going to make the product unmanagable but I gave it a shot and was completely satisfied with the comfort and sound quality
The design of the headset this way is to keep the cable from being in front of your body and more off to the side
These ear buds are really as described by seller
Excellent sound for that amount of money
Sits nicely in ear and cable is long enough not like some others that I used before
I would recommend these to everyone who doesn;t really care for brand name but quality of the sound
I don't consider myself an audiophile, but sound quality is important to me
These have more than impressed me and their currently shaking my ears
The bass response is incredible, I can literally feel them vibrating in my ears as I write this
They're very comfortable and make a great seal
I've recommended these to all my friends and recommend them to anyone reading this
You won't be disappointed
Be sure to buy direct from Amazon though to avoid getting a counterfeit
After extensive research and reading numerous reviews, including my previous experience with Sennheiser, and the most helpful and positive review from Ted S
"Kilpsch Image S4 killers, November 17, 2011 ", I bought the Sennheiser CX300 MX II
I simply don't like writing reviews and I will not go into extensive detail about the pros and cons, but as a heads up to someone that want a quality product, do not buy the Sennheiser CX300 MX II
The problem with these headphone/earbuds is the asymmetrical cable
After the split to each ear-bud the cable becomes significantly thinner
The poor quality cable is so sensitive that you simply cannot move your head or even breath without getting interference
I own other Sennheiser products, including a professional microphone, but I am very disappointed and annoyed with this product
I want my money back
I was looking for higher-level earbuds and checked out several sites and many editors and consumer reviews before settling on these
From the first track, they provided excellent range and presence
Solid low-end as well as high-end without missing any of the mid-range
If you want serious high-fidelity, earbuds are not the answer
But if you want an easily-portable solution for listening to your iPod, and want something more than the $$ teen range of earbuds, this is a great choice
I love the product
Before I bought, I read reviews about too much bass
I've found that the amount of bass depends on how far one inserts the buds
Deeper insertion = more bass
I keep them inserted fully for my rock & roll because I like the bass
However, even with full insertion, it does not overwhelm the higher pitched tones of guitar, vocals, or snare drum
I think they sound great on both a Sansa Fuze and Sony Walkman
I do not consider myself an audiophile but I'm more discerning about sound than most people
I rated it 4 stars because the cord for the right ear is much longer than the left ear
I had never seen this before
I'm not sure this is correct but I wrap the right cord around the back of my neck
I got these once before a while back, and have been waiting for a good deal to come along, and it finally did
These are great earbuds
i use it on the train and can still hear well
the in-ear style is good as it doesn't slip out of your ears and help to isolate outside noises
i think it's definitely worth its price
In my opinion for the price, these are some awesome sounding earbuds
They are comfortable, and do not hurt my ears after wearing them for a few hours
They lock outside sound pretty well
and they look good
Awesome engineering Sennheiser
Thanks
Bass hits and is decent
Only thing i didn't know it was a symmetrical which sucks if you like to wear your cable in the front
Not much sound isolation when in the car with people or around people
Definitely not for use on a plane,you need over the ear noise cancelling headphones for that,you really won't hear anything much on a plane
It really does emphasise the bass above the other sounds,that is if you really like bass no matter what song you're listening too
Listening to my ipod is a great insomnia cure, but it requires comfy earbuds
These do the job
This is my third or fourth pair--can't remember which--they get a lot of use
My reasons for replacing them have varied: the rubber doughnut things fell off one night and I couldn't find them, I broke a wire somewhere and the sound kept cutting in & out, I wanted a spare to take on a trip
But I've got no complaints about quality or price
The Sennheiser Cx ear buds were one of the best fitting and most comfortable ear buds I have ever used however, they only lasted about a year
After 2 months use of these earphones, the jack came away from the housing
The Sennheiser distributor in Poland said it was an 'evident mechanical fault' which apparently is not covered by the guarantee and refused to repair them
And Saturn Planet, where I bought them, washed their hands of the problem
Avoid this manufacturer
I was so hoping these would work, and was excited to have found high sound quality for a low price
I only use them occasionally, but even then, somewhere in the angled connecting jack, there's something loose
It wiggles around, causing my right earbud to short out
It's now permanently disconnected, rendering these headphones dead for me
I hate having to spend more money and will probably go for the Bose now, to thoroughly invest
I'm SO disappointed and angry
I've bought 2 sets from Sennheiser before and they were amazing
Sound and durability were A+, I get this set as a gift and within less than week of use, they're torn
No, I do not treat them harshly
In fact, I've been extra careful with them, even using the pouch that's included
I suspected that the extra bulky jack would be a problem, but I never imagined that it would TEAR
I really hope they honor their warranty on this product and that this is a fluke
Otherwise, it's certainly not worth it to spend 4x the amount of earbuds that break before you can even enjoy them
I just threw out my second pair in the last year
Both had a sudden drop in volume to minimally useful level
i see online that many others had the same issue
Sound quality was superb but it is rather important that the sound continues for at least a few years, isn't it
i am giving Klipsch a try now
we'll see
The only reason I've ever had to get a new pair of these other than because I've lost them
I've left them out in the rain and they got ran over on a gravel driveway and they still worked fine
I've had a pair of Klipsh image S4s and they were shit
The silicon ear pieces always fell off and the cord broke within weeks of having them
Im no audiophile so I can't say too much about the sound other than they've never disappointed me
BUY THESE
The wire had broken right at the place where connected to the right earbud after 4 months of use
Now only the left is still working properly
Earbuds came with uneven non-adjusable chords
Figured I'll tolerate this manufacturing malfunction, but now they don't even work after 6 months
Can't return now
Fantastic, simply put as good as full traditional headphones near twice their price which is saying a hell of a lot, absolutely a must have for anyone that want to jog wit fantastic audio minus the whole over ear headphone thing that can cause problems
By the way as for the traditional headphones yeah Sennheiser makes fantastic one of them as well
I have been using this for last 3 years and I bought in some deal for 20 dollars
I am not a heavy user, but this is what I use while I work everyday
I would recommend to anyone, its light weight and awesome
cant say that i've put a lot of time in listening to them, but initial impression overall is good sound quality
nice rich bass and decent balance on mid and upper tones
decent efficiency = dont have to turn up my ipod to get them loud enough
good noise isolation
i purchased these to replace a set of sony earbuds that died
i've been a repeat sony user simply because i liked running the cord behind my neck
these sennheisers definitely have a richer sound quality over the sony units, but the cord quality i thought was a little thin and the sizing of the cushions were not quite right at first
needed to switch between medium and large sizes a few times
after about a week of wearing for about an hour a day, settled on mediums
they somehow fit better over time though
happy with purchase
would give 5 stars if the cord and strain reliefs were of better quality
I had another pair of Sennheiser earbuds that I really liked but gave to someone else
Bought these as a replacement
They have more bass than my original pair
I've been through 3 sets of variations on the Sennheiser CX-300's
I've tried others, Creative, A-Jay, cheap of the shelf ones
And came back to this one because for IE phones they have some of the best bass I've found in the price range on the previous versions
The new bass "enhanced" model sounds nice even with very little burn in and should get better
They've also changed the cord and strain relief
All of my previous sets have worn out at the plug strain relief so maybe this modification will help them last longer
Good sound for the price range
The large ear inserts fit me (some don't, big ear canals
)I now measure against a high end IEM, the Westones UM3X at about $400 they blow any of these away for definition from lows to highs, but not a set you want to run around with at that price
But for normal uses the Sennheiser has become my favoite
I should check on return policy as some were less than a year and the most 2 years
Westone UM3X Triple Driver Monitor Earbuds (with Removable Cable)
Bought them after reading good reviews
They are comfortable to wear and have good sound quality
but don't last very long
I've had three pairs go bad so far; now I'm wondering if I should be looking for something else
Sounded nice while they lasted, but after one month of incredibly light use, the right earbud no longer works
Simply unacceptable build quality
Product was purchased new, but arrived with cracked opened packaging and only one functioning earbud
The sound out of the functioning speaker was fairly good, but ultimatly pointless
Would not buy again
First I would like to point out that I had these earphones for 3 years now and I'm writing based on my experience with them
These were the best earphones I ever heard for that kind of money anything better would probably cost 3 times as much and I don't think the difference will be that much also I would like to point out at how durable they are I wear them while running and exercising and at many points they were accidentally snatched out of my ears (by me :S) and they still survived and still sound great (especially the bass)
I would definitely recommend them to anyone
I grew up listening to the Beatles on a reel to reel player
Been through the cassette tapes, cds, and now digital audio
At the same time I have tried every type of headphone available on the market but not the in-ear earbud type
I tend to buy high priced headphones but probably will never do that again
Stop searching, buy this
If you are used to the old style headphones, these will take a few days to get used to
The key is to find the right size ear-piece(one that will direct the sound into ear canal directly)
The product comes with 3 size ear-pieces
I went back and forth several times and when I dialed it in right, there is no comparison
I am comparing them to Sennheiser HD438 headphones
These cost less and sound better, but you have to set them just right for them to sound right
I have done that and I am sold
Won't listen to music on the old school headphones anymore unless I break the cord on the earbuds
Haven't worked out with them, so I can't speak to that
But these earbuds are not advertised to be that kind of earbud
Jam on
Note: There are third party vendors selling this product for 1$ or 2$ less than Amazon, this means that these sellers will show up first in Amazon's search results
If you search for this product and check "Amazon Only" in the seller column on the left you can purchase from Amazon for pennies more
This will guarantee that you get the manufacture's warranty
Rock on
I have had these buds for about 2 years and they are still my favorite
I am not an audiophile by any means, but I can tell the difference between crappy sound and good sound
These buds have great range no matter what kind of music you listen to (depending on the file bit rate, obviously)
The bass is nice and deep and the treble resonates without being annoying no matter what volumne
I also have a pair of Beats by Dre and in a year I have already popped my left monitor
But the CX300 are still blastin' and I use them at a minimum of 40 hours a week
If you want something better than free apple buds and the $10 Skullcandies that break at the plastic seams but don't want to spend more than $50, these are the way to go
This is my second pair and I still love them
I just wish that they could avoid that awful CX300 badge that is at display
Sound quality is great, a little too much bass but thats usual with in ear headphones
Will keep buying Sennheiser for sure
I owned 3 of these headphones and I just love them
I got one for workplace and one for home usage and another one for my wife
We just love them
The sound and base come from this headphone is awesome
The price is decent too
If you're looking for a nice and decent price headphone, this is IT
I bought these because I heard that Sennheiser was a quality brand, and while these aren't the most expensive earbuds I figured they'd allow me to hear more nuances of the music than my $10 generic cheapie pair I've had for the last few years
However, this was not very apparent
The bass is very good, and the noise cancellation is excellent
For the price I paid, (under $40) I have no complaints at all, I just was expecting to be a little more blown out of the water than I was
I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones, but these are superb
I love the Sennheiser brand, and these headphones are impeccable
Not only do they fit well in my ears but the sound quality is unmatched
I was glued to my Apple headphones, but not anymore
Sennheisers are the way to go as far as convenience and quality goes
The cord length is perfect, and the added pouch keeps them protected in my pocket
I would recommend these to anyone looking for an upgrade (especially from the Apple headphones)
This is a long review so I'll get straight to the bottom line first:  you absolutely can't go wrong with these earbuds, particularly as an upgrade to the ones that came with your mobile phone or iPod
Now that's out of the way, on to the details
In terms of sound quality, these don't disappoint
I decided on these after the pair of Samsung buds included with my Galaxy Nexus went out, and I wanted an upgrade over the very average, muddled sound they offered (decent sound for a free pair of buds)
I had already purchased those other darlings of the Internet, the Klipsch S4, for my wife and decided I wanted to try something different (more on that in a moment)
These Sennheiser's offer a very good, flat-ish frequency response, crisp highs and mids, full, tight bass, very open soundstage (especially for earbuds), and no detectable distortion
Sound isolation is average for earbuds
If I have any minor nitpicks with the sound, it's that some higher-end frequencies may fall off a little
More specifically, silibant sounds (like "s-sounds" from a vocalist, or cymbal or top-hat crashes) may lose a little clarity
However, this is a very minor nitpick; most people will hardly notice anything
For a more scientific review check this out:  [
]Some things to note about the headphones themselves:  I'd say build quality is average
They seem durable enough but nothing special
Aesthetically, there's very little to set them apart from the multitudes of other earbuds, but that's fine by me
The buds rest just inside your ear canal, and are some of the most comfortable buds I've worn
They come with two pairs of alternate-size cups, and if you select the right size for your ear, they create a pretty decent seal
They also come with a faux-leather carrying pouch, which I find quite useful for stuffing into my pocket without having to worry about damage or pocket lint
They also have an asymmetrical cord design, which means you're meant to drape the bud with the longer cord around the back of your neck (rather than in front), so as to keep the cord out of your way
Some people will like this, others won't
I can take it or leave it
This is a no-frills pair of buds that attempt to provide the best sound quality for your buck
Finally, since sound quality is ultimately subjective, probably the best way to judge for yourself is by comparison
I'm sure there are many worthy and viable alternatives in this price range, but the most popular (and what I have experience with) are the Klipsch S4's
Are they Klipsch killers
Well, yes and no
First, the Klipsch are a little more difficult to wear in my opinion
For the longest time, I wasn't wearing them properly (creating a good seal in my ear canal), so I was falsely underwhelmed
However, I discovered you basically have to cork-screw them into your ear canal
I found it slightly unsettling at first, but got used to it
I also found that all the praise the Klipsch were getting from professional reviewers and regular customers alike was completely justified
The Klipsch have a similarly good frequency response, and I found the sound (particularly the highs) to be a little more defined
Overall, the Sennheiser buds have a more open sound field and have a slightly warmer sound, whereas the the Klipsch sound is slightly more detailed and crisp (almost a little harsh), and have a tad bit more bass, although neither buds are bass slouches
All this will boil down to personal preference, but I think the Klipsch edge out the Sennheiser by the narrowest of margins
Also, the Klipsch come in a version (S4i) with an inline mic and volume buttons to use with your iPhone or Android for about $20 more
The MSRP for the regular Klipsch are $90 (I think), but can be had on Amazon for ~$50, which is a phenomenal value
Perhaps the only better value, however, are the Sennheiser pair (MSRP $80, Amazon price $35-$40)
At that price the quality-to-value is unbeatable
Between the two, go for the Klipsch S4 if you're a bass-head or want the inline accessories
Otherwise, the Sennheiser CX300-ii are a worthy alternative for even less change
I guarantee you won't find better sound quality in a $35 pair of earbuds
If you made it through this entire review, thank you
I hope it helps
UPDATE 2/28/14:  It pains me to say I finally sold these babies
They'll be sorely missed
Alas, I now have the bug and have since moved on to better and more expensive headphones (the IEMs I now use are the Yamaha EPH-100 and the Philips Fidelio S2)
However, I remain very impressed by these IEMs and don't regret for a second buying them
I still believe they remain one of the best, if not the very best, cost-to-quality values in earbuds/IEMs
A few lasting impressions after almost 2 years of use - I still feel sound quality is excellent despite using much more expensive cans
I actually ended up marginally preferring their sound signature to the Klipsch S4s, even though the Klipsch have slightly more detail
They're also a lot more durable than I even gave them credit for
I left these in my pants pocket once, and they ended up going through the wash and part of a dry cycle before I rescued them
Yet there was no sign of damage and they still worked perfectly
Unbelievable
They'll keep a special place in my audiophile heart
The sennheiser CX 300B MKII precision headphones are pretty much simply amazing and extraordinary headphones for a great price, excellent
The sound quality is good, though they're a bit lacking in the low end of the spectrum
Noise canceling is excellent as long as you're not wearing them inside a motorcycle helmet, which I am
They do not seem to be able to cancel out wind noise as well as other earbuds, like JVC Marshmallows, or Skullcandys
Good sound and comfortable fit, use them every day with no discomfort
Nice headphones for the price, the best under $100
They'll be lucky to last a month
Plus, I hate it when the wire for one side is shorter than the wire on the other side
Of course, the wire is so thin and flimsy, they'll fall apart soon, so it really doesn't matter
Short and sweet unless you hate earbuds these are a must have
I looked at buying a "better" set as my beater V-Moda set died and needed something durable for the beach and rugged use
I own the of Shure high-end ones you see people get molds of their ears for and of course love them
very very flat response as they should be
I wanted a little more boom for banging around with and these are 100% perfect
The bass is close to what you might hear with a good set of over-the-ear cans
I have excellent hearing and when I play music at higher volumes I want just that, volume
I would say that is the best strength of these is that trait
The bass is strong all the way through
but the big surprise is the delicate sounds you miss with cheap headphones and buds
I would put these right up there with my Shure setup
for a ton less money
If you do not like these then you are either impossible to please or need to get a hearing test
These Sennheiser's are great in that they are designed in such a way that they actually will stay in one's ears and not fall out, they have good quality sound (bass and treble), and they block out the majority of background noise very well
These are perfect for the commuter who wants to listen to their Portable music device on the bus or train, and at 30-30$ its just as good of sound as the 100+ earbuds out there
I have purchased from Sennheiser before, so when my old earbuds from another company stopped working, I thought I'd give these a try
Overall, I am happy with them
Positive:Good sound qualityLess interference with these via the cord rubbing/touching anything vs
my old pairRight angle of plug is much better than the straight kind
I feel like it's much more durable and less likely to have issues in the future if it bumps anything
Carrying case is a very nice bonus
I use mine all the time to prevent them from being damaged when in my bag
Neutral:Asymmetrical cord
You can either like these or not
Negative:Sometimes one of the earbuds tends to fit less snugly than the other
I'm not sure if that particular adapter is slightly smaller than the other, but moving up in size for that one would make it too big, so I'm stuck
Not a big negative though, as it usually stays in
EDIT/UPDATE: The problem earbud hasn't fallen out in quite some time, and I'm not sure exactly what caused the issue previously or why it has changed
I'll maintain that for the first year or two it had this problem, but somehow it now conforms properly to my ear
Go figure
This is my second pair and I still love them
I just wish that they could avoid that awful CX300 badge that is at display
Sound quality is great, a little too much bass but thats usual with in ear headphones
Will keep buying Sennheiser for sure
I owned 3 of these headphones and I just love them
I got one for workplace and one for home usage and another one for my wife
We just love them
The sound and base come from this headphone is awesome
The price is decent too
If you're looking for a nice and decent price headphone, this is IT
These earbuds are simply outstanding and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for good sound quality
The highs are clear and crisp and the enhanced bass is very strong
They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time
There's a fair amount of sound/noise transfer from the wiring so these are not meant for use while jogging or other serious activity
They have a 2 year warranty so be sure to keep your purchase receipt
My last pair had the right unit stop working after a year
I sent them back to Sennheiser USA and had a new pair in a week
Also, be wary of imitations of these earbuds and be sure to buy only through Amazon or other reputable dealer
So, get a pair and enjoy
i bought these with a fiio amp
i havent exactly used them for music without the amp but i assure you that the extra 20 bucks for the amp makes it well worth it
i like to listen to metal and dubstep, these headphones are really good for both
on the amp there are like 4 settings and i use them all, i use the last one for dubstep and it vibrates my eardrum
feels funny but it is sooo awsome
i recomend the amp
but they may be just as good without, idk*update* i have had them for well over a year now
after one pair went through the washer *amazon so nicely replaced* i have had 2 pairs
this 2nd pair also went through the washer but the warranty was up
buuut i had sprayed wd40 into them before hand saving them in the end
because they are still going strong
i use these heavily and with no remorse
i wrap em up and through them in my backpack before i leave for school
the rubber peice that the jack comes out of split on me and the metal accents came loose
though they are old and it has not effected the sound or anything important at all
and for anyone who gets these and cant figure out the whole chord length thing
the long chord is meant to go around the back of your neck
it is a cool feature
in my opinion they are well worth the money
Before purchasing this item I had my doubts about the headphones being special enhanced based ones
I wondered if it would have an over saturated base or if you really couldn't tell the difference between based enhanced ones or normal headphones
The fact is, they have really good strong base and they don't over saturate
Since they are in ear headphones you can hear the music much louder than the ordinary iPhone headphones for example
Sennheiser is a really good brand
I recommend this product
Just got my set in today, tried them out, almost blew my eardrums out
I had my laptop's volume up way loud like I would with my Sony's, which was way too loud for these
Great bass, good highs, no static
I could barely notice any bass response at all with these and so I just sent them back to Amazon
My old V-Moda's have much better bass and decent clarity
Too bad Amazon does not offer V-Moda's anymore
Also should mention that the packaging on these Sennheiser buds is about as frustrating as can be
Took 5 minutes to open the package because I wanted to be careful not to damage the wires
I had the first iteration of the CX300s and it lasted me about two years - the only problem the first had was that the design of the earbud wires would cause it to split
The second version fixes that issue
The sound quality matches that of the first, and it almost feels like the earbuds are much more comfortable this time around
I was able to wear the buds for hours before feeling any sort of discomfort
Great sound right out of the box
Crisp bass, clear mids/highs (especially vocals), and well-balanced
I've tested many earbuds (Bose, Shure, Sony, Ultimate Ears) priced much higher and these are my clear favorite
For this price you CANNOT get better headphones
I used to own and old pair of SHURE earbuds that I absolutely loved
Worked perfect for me, but they are no longer being made so I started looking around for a new set
Ended up looking at these and saw some great reviews, I've had Sennheiser cans before and loved them
Figured I couldnt really go wrong
Man was I wrong
These are so bad it makes me wonder if something is wrong
Run them from my iphone and my shuffle both and get the same tinny, muffled mids sound
I dont think Id get thru a workout without ripping these things out of my ear from ear fatigue
ALSO I didnt look close but it never was obvious that these earphones have 2 different lengths from the Y, Im assuming so you can route them down one side of your head
NOT what I was looking for with how I wear a shuffle around my neck at the gym
Not really a horrible thing, but wasnt expected
That added with what to me is horrible horrible sound makes these things all around lame
excelent performance, I was expecting better bass sound, but everything sound really amazing, the only thing is that the cord is so fragile, you need to be very carefull with it, but for the price, is really good
I also have had several pairs of the older version of these and gave them away to family members
This set I'm keeping
The bass is fuller than the CX300B
None of these have ever failed me in my travels over the years
Watch out for imitations
These broke after a few weeks after standard use
Are not good for exercising and fit awkwardly
Can definitely find better earbuds for the price
so i finally decided to review these after almost 2 years of use
the reason was because when i put on a fresh pair of pants, i checked the pocket and realized that my sennheisers (which i thought i lost) were in there
then my heart sank because i didn't think they'd be able to survive the washing machine
but i decided to plug them in anyways
LO AND BEHOLD
they still work perfectly
sounds just like the day i got it
it goes without saying that i was very, very impressed
if these earphones can last the soapy water and violence of a washing machine, they can definitely last through everyday, regular use
5 stars all the way
I own the Ultimate Ears Super
fi 5 EB (extended bass)
It had two drivers, low end diaphragm, and a mechanism for mid-highs
These are VERY large and stand out like no other canal earphone
I call them my Frankenstein phones
But the bass remains deep, hard, and heavy, particularly with an equalizer
They don't break up at all, unless you reach 100 decibels, which is not a good idea
I can't believe the other UE no owned by logitech don't hold a candle to these 3 year old originals
I took a shot, and listened to Sennheiser CX 300b extended bass, which as it turns out, I didn't hate
Proper fit using foam, these single drivers try hard, so you really can't push them hard
But they are acceptable in value at this price
I bought these out of the 6 pair of UE's, including the Triple 10's (incredibly disappointing in bass)
I think the Senneiser's are a safe bet on a limited budget
The good:The sound quality is pretty good for the price
There are different size earbud covers to choose from (unfortunately, none of them fit my ears well at all and they fit worse than other earbuds I've had, but you might have better luck)
The bad:I really disliked the uneven left and right cable lengths (the left is shorter)
I know it is intended to wrap the longer one around the back of your neck, but personally, I don't like that either
Very awkward
The sound quality diminishes substantially if you intend to run, walk, or move with these on, as the movement of the cord very noticeably interferes with what's playing
The ugly:I've had them for about two months and the left bud is already dangerously quiet and faltering
My $14 pair lasted longer than two months
ugh
Bottom line: You can do better
These are my second pair of Sennheiser CX300 earbuds
The first pair lasted a few wonderful years until the one time I left them on my desk and my naughty kitten chewed up the cord
I tried 4 different brands and finally went back to these
I work in a cubicle in an office and these earbuds block out all of the annoying office noises so I can concentrate
I listen to a wide variety of music types; heavy metal, classic rock, blues, and everything sounds wonderful
Since I'm not fiscally wealthy, budgeting is an important discipline to my life
But, for this once, I deviated--a bit
This is where I splurged: $46 AMAZON PRIME
For the sake of knowledge, the test was worth it, and I've got two very nice pair of Earbuds to alternate back n forth; the "SENNHEISER CX300B MKII Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds" produce a more mellow overall sound, probably better suited to someone wanting Mid-Range with Bass, not being overly concerned with High Notes
The "SENNHEISER CX300B MKIIs" offer that smooth in-the-Living Room atmosphere
The "SENNHEISER CX200s" deliver crisp, clear Acoustic High Notes, and very good Bass regardless of what device they're plugged into
Both are extremely adequate due to their unique design, blocking out external noises
Oh, and Asymmetrical [Cords] of the CX300B MKIIs, are defined as: "Uneven" in length, is purposely designed
My opinion: you can't go wrong purchasing either, however if you prefer a more engineered sound, the "SENNHEISER CX300B MKIIs Precision Enhanced Bass Earbuds" will grow on you
--GBJ
These earbuds are by far some of the best ones I have found to date
The bass is over-powering, hi's/mid's are crisp & clear
For the money, they are better than some of the more high-priced buds I have purchased in the past
Only downside I see is the cord length
Even at the Sennheiser site, cords are of different length
If you can deal with different lengths, you will love these buds
These are the worst ear buds I have owned
They stay in the ears good but the sound quality is horrible
Don't waste your money on them
Cannot say enough good things about Sennhesier
Their products are awesome and have never let me down
My first pair of these before i lost them went through the washer and dryer and still worked great
If that doesn't show build quality then I am not sure what does
These sound much better than any pair of skullcandy headphones and also last much longer
Not to mention Sennhesier makes tons of professional audio products to support their consumer levels products
These are the best sounding earbuds priced below $100 i've heard
These little gems pump out rich, dynamic sound with a minimum of amplification, making them perfect for portable electronics
The CX-300ii's offer a lively presentation with well defined bass and a beautifully clean and extended treble
These buds comfortably sit mid ear and, once seated, stay put
I do wish the cord was better, it's a little thin and tangles easily
This model has an asymmetrical cable which I happen to like, but is a matter of personal preference
These are outstanding earbuds for the discriminating listener
Highly recommended, but as always buy from an authorized dealer only
On the left headphone has obvious cracks can let me see the inside of the parts, rough work, headset bags and fake headphones
I understand this isn't an "expensive" set of earbuds, but I normally get $20 ones and honestly, I couldn't notice that great of a difference between my old ones and these
The reason I went out of my way to get Sennheisser, though, was because I was hoping these would last longer
I was wrong
It's been 5 months and the right earbud suddenly stopped working
This thing has a 2 year warranty but there is no seller for me to contact
Overall, I'm kind of disappointed in this product
Confortable, light, perfect sound, deep bass
There is the perfect headphones for a person who are looking for true quality of sound in general
Having had Sennheiser headphones previously, the earbuds seemed like a good idea
not
Made in China, not Germany as my headphones were, so-so sound quality
Inexplicably, one side was 4-5 inches longer than the other with no adjustment because the collar is fixed
Wonky as my kids would say, returned to seller, prompt refund from Amazon
Bass: outstanding
Works great with EQ
These are honestly the best earphones for under 45$Might consider to find the same length cable
Cause this one has one cord longer then the other
I like it cause I can wrap the other one around my neck
Works great with dubstep
But still is good with any other genre
Recommended to my friends and they really loved them
Comes with a little pouch for them and extra earbuds
I don't regret buying these
If you want to understand what it is like walking over to Rick Moranis's house and telling him to shrink down some subwoofers so that you can shove them in your ears, this is what that's like
I've had these earbuds for over a month now
I've trusted Sennheiser ever since buying their Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones
And let me tell you something, they have proven themselves to me once again
I have listened to a wide variety of music on them, including but not limited to: Blasting, brutish, simplistic forms of music such as Dubstep; Zomboy, Flux Pavilion, the better known Skrillex, and such
Thumping, ghetto-shaking hip-hop like The Game, DMX, Ludacris
Complex, string-filled, screaming heavy metal such as Judas Priest, Manowar, Sabaton
Heavy, multilayered industrial like Front Line Assembly, KMFDM, Revco
When it comes time to relax, I put on the calmer stuff
Ambient and serene like Pan American, Boards of Canada, Robert Rich
Downtempo like Portishead, Kruder and Dorfmeister, Glitch Mob (I don't know if they're downtempo, but they share some of the elements)
Then there's whatever the hell genre Beats Antique falls under
Anyway, my point is that I haven't listened to any music these earbuds can't massage into your skull like fine oil
They do justice to just about everything I listen to, and I've even noticed new elements in old favorites I've listened to hundreds of times over the years
Not only do they have the range for very complicated music, but their bass is fantastic, and if you wanna listen to some ghetto blasting music one minute and put on Moonlight Sonata the next, you're all set
The asymmetrical design also is much better than I thought at first, it actually makes the cord much more manageable since the right ear's cord goes behind your neck so it's not in your way
I've even used these while gardening, I just route the cord under my shirt so that I don't catch it with a rake and yank them from my ears like an idiot
I used to have a set of JBuds J2 Premium Hi-Fi Noise-Isolating Earbuds Style Headphones For Samsung Galaxy / Android / Windows Phone / Captivate / Brightside / Stratosphere - Black/Electric Blue and these are not only sharper, but louder
They are well worth being double the price, I can tell you that
I no longer max out the volume on my iPhone so I can get some thumping while I'm on the treadmill
That's another thing, the noise cancellation on these is FANTASTIC
I can't hear a damn thing if I'm listening to something intense
Now, don't get me wrong, if you have the volume rolled back and you're listening to some jazz, you'll hear your dog barking and things will come through, albeit muffled
But even at medium volume it's hard to hear anything, and I cannot hear my feet or the treadmill at all once I have the volume up and my music is going
I don't know enough about acoustics to cite decible noise attenuation, but these will block a good 70-80% of sound by my own completely subjective guesstimate
Also, please take this with a grain of salt; the little rubber cushion things that go around the earbud and you stick in your ear canal (I don't know what they're called) fit my ear canals just perfectly, the seal is phenomenal
Everyone's ears are different, and they may not fit yours they way they did mine
Okay, now that I'm done singing the praises, let's go over the downsides
That perfect seal I mentioned
It can actually screw me up sometimes because it's so complete
Heat can build up in the air pocket between earbud and eardrum, and they also alter how the body deals with the air pressure in your head because they block the ears so completely, screwing with the function of the eustachian tubes, so when you're chugging water while exercising, it may be disorienting
Normally this isn't an issue, but sometimes I find myself taking the earbuds out and swallowing to correct the pressure
It doesn't bother me all that much, and honestly, if your ear canals are sized different, it may not be an issue for you, but I felt it bore mention
It doesn't generally become an issue till I do something physical, when I listen to music while laying in bed to go to sleep, I don't have this problem
The rubberized texture of the cord can cause it to become tangled and cling to itself sometimes
I've put a hook on my wall and I hang the earbuds from it to prevent tangles, and I don't have real issues with it, but I know this material, because I've had other earbuds with the same stuff
If you roll it up improperly, it will tangle itself
There are ways of rolling your earbud cords so they don't tangle, but most people don't know that (Google it, it's good info)
Don't just wad these up and shove them in the neat little case they provide, because you're going to have a wad of black spaghetti with little speakers wedged in there like horrible tasting meatballs
Pay attention when you want to store them compact
I also simply have no idea how long these will last, it's only been a bit over a month
My J2 earbuds lasted me about 18 months if memory serves before they popped
Now, I've had the HD280 headphones for about two years four months, and they're still running strong
So if if these are anything to go by, I'm hoping to get a few good years out of these earbuds
In any case, I hope this information proves useful to someone
I will update if my earbuds explode or spontaneously evaporate into plasma or something
I've ordered these one for my wife, they are awesome in many ways
I love this deep sound and quality is amazing
with Sennheiser you can't go wrong
Now I'm ordering one for myself
These earbuds fit comfortably, much better than the competing Klipsch Image S4s
They don't quite have the same full range, they are a bit more bassy, but they are worlds more comfortable, usable, and wearable
I am an active person, and these earbuds are stay in my ears really well
They are very comfortable and sit low in my ears
Perfect for wearing under my motorcycle helmet
Love these, I just purchased my 3rd pair in 3 years
I sliced the cable on my first pair and dragged the second pair 40 miles caught outside of my car door
This is why you don't buy $300 earbuds :)
The sound was great for a month
Now the left sound is gone
I was so carful with them, don't buy them I'm out 40$ :(
Hello Amazon,I use these earbuds every morning during my work out routine where go through hell
Between humidity, the wires getting torn by work out equipement, etc
I never had any problem whatsoever with these
They stick to my ears no matter what
I paid 30 bucks (it was during a promotion) and I would recommend them to anyone who needs tough and powerful earbuds
Only cons, the isolation is maybe too strong, if you put the volume to the maximum, there's no way you can hear the environment (which is good in a way but may be dangerous if you're driving)
I bought these to replace the Klipsch Image X10 Noise-Isolating Earphone I purchased 3 months prior
I was completely unhappy with all aspects of the Klipsch from the price, sound quality, fit
overall these were lacking of what you'd expect from a Klipsch product
I had purchased a pair Sennheisers CX300's a while ago and they were very good
I wanted to upgrade hence I purchased the Klipsch
Now when I got my new pair of Sennheisers that I purchased for a third of what I paid for the Klipsch I was very pleasantly surprised
Everything from the higher grade cable to the comfort was so much better
The sound these things put out for less than $50 is pretty amazing
I would highly recommend to anyone looking to get a great comfortable pair of excellent headphones to give these a try
The low end is solid and the mids and highs are very crisp and natural
I can actually fall asleep with these things in my ears
I should have stayed with the Sennheisers
Ok, so I sat here staring at my computer screen for weeks on end trying to find some good quality headphones that have crisp highs with some decent bass so I wouldn't have to settle for the overpriced, poorly made Dre Beats
Reading review after review with some saying best headphones, and others giving a 1 star
All I have to say is, WOW
These headphones blew away my expectations especially for the price
I use them at the gym mostly and they cancel out all noise so I can just get in the zone and pump out my sets
The bass is surprisingly strong, but not overwhelming
If you listen to all types of music (as I do), from metal to rap to dubstep, these headphones do them JUSTICE
Sennheiser hit the nail on the head with fair priced headphones with insane quality
My friend has Dr
Dre Beats Earbuds and he is pissed that he bought them after hearing these for 3x the price of the MK II's
Cons - I'll drop the cons first because there is only ONE: You can hear the cord moving around
Like I said, I use these headphones in the gym, and the cord makes a little noise (not static, just a noise of the cord rubbing, doesn't affect the music at all)
Just when I lean against something in between songs, I can hear it
When music is playing, it is hardly noticeable, so hardly a con
Pros - These have yet to fall out of my ears after running on a treadmill at 9mph for 20min straight
They don't say "sport" earbuds, but once in your ear, they aren't going anywhere
I usually have the most trouble trying to get earbuds to sit in my ear comfortably, but the stock out of the package ear pieces were the perfect fit
The extra two it came with were not even needed
Great sound quality, never buying anything but sennheiser again
I sweat in these things all day and still bump loud and proud
I bought these earbuds after a HORRIBLE experience with a pair of beats by dre
I did a little research and found that these came pretty highly recommended, so I figured I would give it a shot, and I am absolutely pleased
Really good sound quality
Great clarity
Good, but not overpowering bass
The ear buds are pretty comfortable
Normally I prefer the foam tips, but I have stayed with the silicone factory tips here because they are more comfortable than I expected
The different cord length doesn't really bother me as I have had a couple other pairs with a similar design in the past
Also the price is right for these earbuds
At $45, they are a steal and rank similarly to earphones that are in the $100 range
Overall, I couldn't ask for any better
I use these at the gym, listening to music and probably have used them every day for a month and no issues at all
A good choice
These are by the far the highest quality and best sounding earbuds I've ever used
The digital sound quality is incredible (crisp, clean sound and channeled so that I have an "all around" sound system)
They also do an excellent job of blocking out external noise without the volume being turned up on blast, which is a key feature I have not been able to find in other earbuds
These are an incredible deal for an excellent set of headphones
Robustly made, too, so I think they'll last me a while
Will definitely not got back to those crappy, generic earbuds ever again
PITY on me,,, i was paying over 100 for bose in ear amd just got this product to try,,, what a bass, man,, i guess i will stop buying the over priced from bose and use this nice set and hoping it lasts at least a yer or 2,,, thanks Sennhaiser for such a good product
I like the sound quality but it does not do as good of a job cancelling outside noise as my JBuds did
excelent performance, I was expecting better bass sound, but everything sound really amazing, the only thing is that the cord is so fragile, you need to be very carefull with it, but for the price, is really good
I also have had several pairs of the older version of these and gave them away to family members
This set I'm keeping
The bass is fuller than the CX300B
None of these have ever failed me in my travels over the years
Watch out for imitations
The pair of headphones I received had the right ear-bud at twice the length of the left
Not necessarily a bad thing but it causes unwanted pulling and fatigue on my ears
Shame, because these things sounded BOSS
Good quality and good sound, if you are not the guy who crazy about music, this is a good choice
sound quality is awesome and rich
great bass sound
but they are not good for running or jogging
they can come off easily if you move around too much
also, I'm not used to asymmetrical cords yet but that doesn't bother me too much
I think it was a reasonable price for the sound quality you get
These buds are a great buy for the price
I've had them for a couple of weeks now and am very satisfied with their performance for the 35 bucks I paid
The mids and highs are good the bass is alot better then I expected coming from an earbud which I think is what sennheiser was going for with this particular model
For the price there should be no complaints about the performance side of these buds unless you got a fake
The only acceptable complaint is if you've had some kind of durability  mishap like the wire broke for no good reason or something along those lines
Which I haven't encountered yet but the wire is very thin and suggest to be careful when handling
Overall they are a great for someone like me who doesn't care if I can hear the producer ripping a fart from the mixing board like you can with your shure 535s if you don't have alot of money get these you will be satisfied
I am in no way an audiophile or expert in the earbud sound quality department
This is the second pair of Sennheiser CX300B bass earbuds I've received via Amazon
The first pair I tried to use with a new 6th generation Ipod Classic
Between the Ipod's terrible choice for an audio driver (5th gen Ipod classic was brilliant) and the earbuds, the highs were ear splitting for me, so I gave them to a family member who liked them
That was in 2009 or so
Just recently, I received these earbuds as a gift
Well, knowing I did not like the sound of them I looked around online to see if there is a way to lower the over all high tones and found a very simple solution
I attached foam ear pieces onto the buds, thus reducing the high tones (muffling) and improving the sounds of my 6th gen Ipod classic as well
Try the foam pieces on with a "bass test" on YouTube
com and you'll hear the difference
The headphones themselves have a short (left) cord and long (right) cord and come with three sizes of thin rubber-like ear pieces (to fit into the ear)
I did not receive a case, as the ad states
In the final analysis, these earbuds probably perform quite nicely with good (or better) audio devices
I have used these earbuds for the last three years in variety of environments e
g
laptop, mowing, construction/remodeling, polishing vehicles,etc
Granted my hearing isn't exactly perfect from too many years of loud music and operating farm/industrial equipment without ear protection 30 years ago
Pros:-Very durable-The offset cord design & length helps to prevent the earbuds being pulled out when you are stretching/bending-Offer a basic level of sound isolation
I typically use ear muffs over them if working/operating equipment
-Good voice clarity-Good mid & highs-Good bassCons/areas for improvement:-Sound isolationConsidering these earbuds are under $35, they provide great performance and durability
If your looking for heavy bass these might not be for you
Sennheiser CX300 II retails for $70 and the V-Moda Remix Remote retails for $80
I own both
I have extensively compared both with many tracks from many different genres
The V-Moda Remix before being burned-in had equal sound quality to a pair of burned-in CX300 II's
It was literally 100% identical
But after 48 hours of burn-in, the difference was very significant, audible and very noticeable
It was NOT just my imagination
The difference being that the V-Moda is superior in sound quality in terms of accuracy, bass reproduction, clarity of mids, crisp smooth intense highs, soundstage, life-like sound, richness & warmth in sound and the instrument separation
The sound quality of the V-Moda Remix Remote's is the best I have ever heard on a pair of earbuds
The lows are absolutely reproduced powerfully well
It is very deep, rich and lifelike
The bass is concert, theater and studio quality
The bass has a crisp, clear, realistic and accurate production
It is only as powerful and emphasized as the artist intended
No boomy, over-emphasized and fake artificial production of bass that completely overpowers the mids and the highs
The mids are well-heard with great clarity
The vocals especially have a very life-like soundstage quality to them
The clarity of a singer's voice in a song is something I have never experienced before in a pair of earbuds
And the highs really move through smoothly with no harshness, missing details and no distortion or rolling off
I can really feel the crisp, clear and smooth quality in the highs
No detail is rolled off in the highs
I can actually feel the earbuds drivers are accurately reproducing an intensity in the highs with full-detailed clarity
These earbuds are flat-response and neutral
The bass produced is very accurate
The mids extremely clear and the highs are pleasantly intense with a crisp accurate depiction that no earbud has ever produced for me
Soundstage is extremely realistic; it is legitimate concert and studio quality
The overall sound effect is pure, "organic" and natural
Instrument separation and reproduction is magnificently accurate
These earbuds give you as much detail as possible and reproduce it accurately as originally intended by the track
Perfect for ALL genres
These are often marketed as suitable for club, dance, techno, rap, hip pop, pop and house
They are wonderful for that but they are just as great for anything else including classical, rock and classical rock
Many earbuds and even full-sized over-ear headphones have a artificial, cold and stiff robotic sound
Clarity, richness, warmth, accuracy and details from headphones by many other brands are often lacking to a significant degree compared to these V-Moda Remix Remote Earbuds
Most people will be shocked and surprised from quality of the sound if they ever heard these earbuds
The build quality is far better in V-Moda than the Sennheiser which is completely plastic and it lacks kevlar reinforced cables which are in the V-Moda
They both have a Two-Year Warranty except V-Moda offers a 50% off lifetime replacement plan after warranty
The only positive the Sennheiser CX300 II has on the V-Moda Remix Remote is the lighter weight and a better carrying pouch which is leather
And the light weight of the CX300 II is not really that great of positive against the V-Moda Remix Remote
After all, the only reason it is a lighter weight is because of plastic build
Not to also mention that the CX300 II lacks a in-line remote control and a mic which offered in the V-Moda Remix Remote
The Sennheiser CX300 II is selling for $50 currently on amazon (excluding tax) while the V-Moda Remix Remote is selling for only $40 currently on amazon (excluding tax)
The better buy by far would be the V-Moda Remix Remote
Sennheiser CX300 II I bought for $55 including tax
V-Moda Remix Remote I bought for $51 including tax
The Sennheiser CX300 II also has a very excellent sound quality but it is noticeably not as good as the V-Moda Remix Remote
It's bass is less punchy, less accurate and a bit artificial to be honest
The mids are defiantly excellent in the CX300 II but the clarity, richness and purity of the mid range is not as great as the V-Moda Remix Remote
The highs of the CX300 II is much less crisp, intense, accurate and bright
Soundstage of the CX300 II is less and the quality of the sound-stage is less compared to the V-Moda Remix Remote
It also lacks a 3D air-flow system which is offered in the V-Moda Remix Remote and the wider frequency range response
Specs of the Sennheiser CX300 IIDriver: 9mm Dynamic, neodymium rare earth magnetFrequency response: 19HZ-21KHZImpedance: 16 ohmsNo air flow system
Specs of the V-Moda Remix RemoteDriver: High-Definition 9mm Dynamic V-MASQUE dynamic technology, neodymium rare earth magnetFrequency response: 5HZ-24KHZImpedance: 16 ohmsV-PORT air flow system delivers a high-definition sound stage
I like both
But the V-Moda Remix I like more because of the much better sound quality in ALL aspects, unbeatable frequency range spectrum and much better build quality unseen in ANY other earbud with a 50% lifetime discount plan after a two-year warranty
I paid pretty much the same price for both (CX300 II: $55 VS
Remix: $51) yet I am getting much much more for my money with the V-Moda Remix Remote
Many reviewers have also commented and reported that the V-Moda Remix Remote has much better sound quality than the Klipsch 4S, Bose earbuds and Shure earbuds
Beats earbuds by Dre are complete garbage compared to these even though they retail for $150 vs $80 for V-Moda Remix Remote
I had been so much impressed with these that I decided to buy the V-Moda Crossfade LP Over-Ear headphones which I also love and I have done a review on
Overall 10/10 for both the Remix Remote and Crossfade LP
(Crossfade LP's many times better but of course those are incomparable since they are over-ear 50mm headphones that cost more vs
in-ear 9mm headphones that are much cheaper as well
)I do think though that they make a great buying combination
One for travel and portability while they other for the best sound performance
8/10 for the Sennheiser CX300 II
Very good and nice product but you can do better for the same price with the V-Moda Remix Remote
These headphones sound fine
The problem is everything else about them
There are 3 different sizes of silicone ear cups and none of them seem to fit my ears; they all either fall out cause they are too small or pop out because they are too big
I have had several pairs of in-ear headphones with a similar design (multiple sized ear cups) and these are the worst fitting ones I have used to date
Granted, this may be a personal problem and might not apply to many others, since ear sizes and shapes differ
The other problems I have with this product are more universal
The gummy rubberized texture of the cord is infuriating
They catch on almost every surface, from fabric to skin
These headphones are the kind with one longer and one shorter cord, so the right headphone theoretically can wrap around the back of your neck instead of dangling in front of you
The gummy texture of the cord gets slightly stuck everywhere, on the back of your neck, on your shirt, in between anything you are wearing over the cord, making it much easier for the buds to get tugged out of your ears when you do something as simple as turn your head
If you wear them under a jacket, the friction of the cord between your shirt and your jacket pulls on the left earbud, making it necessary to constantly be pushing it back into your ear as it is slowly pulled out by the taught cord
The coating also makes it very easy for the cord to get hopelessly tangled when they are stored in a bag or pocket, no matter how carefully you wrap them up, and very frustrating to untangle them
Furthermore, the housing for the L-shaped jack is HUGE and sticks out quite a bit from any device you plug it into, making it easy to get bumped and nudged, which can damage the headphone port in your devices
It is also coated with the same rubbery material as the cord, so it can get stuck and caught on things in your pockets and even pull itself out when you take your device out of your pocket
There is just no reason for it to be that big and bulky
Same goes for the chunky Y-shaped splitter that divides the cord into the right and left channels
It is almost big enough to have a volume slider or microphone on it, but instead it is just an unnecessarily large piece of gummy silicone
It seems like virtually no thought went into the practical use of these earbuds
I bought them because I have historically liked Sennheiser headphones for the audio quality, which, in this case, is the only thing bumping this review up to two stars instead of one
But the experience of using these headphones is actually a hassle: they tangle themselves up at every opportunity, tug themselves out of your ears as you are walking or doing virtually any other activity, and easily unplug themselves from your device when the jack gets caught in your pocket
For my money, I'd go with the similar model of Sony earbuds, which have a slick cord that doesn't get caught on anything and doesn't easily tangle and a small, unobtrusive jack
After my last Koss earbuds died on me after a year, I went to find a replacement
I tried some cheaper Skullcandy but they were not any good because if I moved, all I could hear was the noise from the cord
Thankfully I use my earbuds all day sitting at my desk so I'm not putting any stress on them, but this was still not acceptable
I could have gotten the same Koss again but if they couldn't last long, I decided to try to find better ones
I read many great reviews about Sennheiser earbuds and finally decided on this model
They do a great job blocking outside noise but it's like I have my equalizer turned up with all bass
I tried settings on my computer music player but it's still muffled bass
They are comfortable to wear all day long and they do have a little bit of cord noise
I'll stick with them though as I don't want to have to keep trying different ones just to find a decent pair
I think next time I replace the earbuds and find a good pair, I'm going to then go buy a few more just so I'll have them as replacements
I purchased this to replace a similar set of Sennheiser earbuds I was quite pleased with
They sounded great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4
0 Android MP3 Player, but broke quickly
I had only listened to them about 5 mintues before the Galaxy accidently slipped out of my breast pocket and landed on the table
The Galaxy was OK but the CX300B's odd-shaped stereo plug now has an intermittent connection
It's a throwaway now
The player must have landed on the CX300B's plug
The 90-degree angle plug on my old Sennheisers would have taken the blow without a problem
This earbud's "banana" angle stereo plug is unnecessarily susceptible to damage from dropping your phone or MP3 player
Minus 3 stars for the poorly engineered stereo connection plug
Otherwise, the earbuds are top-quality
The headphones are definitely very good they sound very clear and the bass is good
Honestly i dont know much about headphones because i usually buy skullcandy but after having my 4th pair over the course of less than 2 years brake from the same issue i got tired
What i do have to say about them though is that they sound a bit sharp so when you put it up it sounds a bit odd but there definitely better than skullcandy
I listen to allot of music on the iPhone
I don't expect the sound to be "studio quality"
Based on customer reviews, I did spend nearly $40 more on these Sennheiser CX300B MK II Bass Earbuds ($59
95) to treat myself to what I understood would be 'noticeably better' sound
These arrived in March
I did not notice $40 worth of 'noticeably better' sound quality
The right speaker went flat less than three months later
I'll be going back to Sony's MDREX58V/BLK EX Series Earbuds ($20
47)
I realize that I may have gotten a bad pair
I can afford a $20 fail
$60
Not so much
So I've had these for more than a year now and they're as good as new still
The sounds great and the best part is this doesn't look like it's gonna break
EVER
The wire/cord still looks as good as new and there's something about it that never lets it knot
Untangling is as easy as just shaking it for a few minutes
Very comfy in the ear too
Hi,I think this vendor' Zhang Shao Chun -- had this product (Sennheiser CX300B MK II Bass Earbuds with Carrying Case (Black)) a few bucks cheaper, so I went with him
If these are the real thing I'm Santa Claus
There's absolutely NO BASS or low-end in these Earbuds
I emailed the vendor and he claims he gets these straight from the factory
LOL, which factory I wonder
I've lived in China for several years and street corners are lined with people selling fake everything
In some cases the packaging is identical to the real thing
I play music and have some pretty good quality equipment, so I can say I'm highly disappointed in this product
ALSO --- these are asymmetric so one ear is longer than the others
It's this type of design, and you might miss this in the description
Buyer Beware
Just as others before me have stated, these earbuds worked great for roughly 4 months
Recently, I've found the right channel of this product died and now I'm currently in the market for a new pair
While I love Sennheiser's headphones, I don't think I'll purchase another Sennheiser earbud due to the quality of build
They functioned well for the first 4 months of owning them, and then they decided to stop functioning properly
Sennheiser was, of course, less than helpful - they were willing to repair (ie: replace) but wanted me to pay for shipping - which hardly seemed worth it given the low cost of the item
I own about a dozen pairs of headphones in the $20-50 dollar range, but this is definitely my favorite pair
These are one of the most comfortable types of earbuds I've ever come across and I've worn them for hours at a time
Although these earbuds aren't great for working out with, these are a great everyday pair of headphones
There are no other headphones in this price range which have as good of sound quality
I have never been on for "in ear" type of phones for listening
I have tried and used several which were all uncomfortable
I found out with these that there have been many improvements since the first days of earbuds
These are very comfortable and once seated properly, they stay in place and are very comfortable
Its nice that they come with several size pads, but I would bet that the medium size fits 90% of adult users
I have several pair of full size high end headphones that, until now, were the only way for me to enjoy a good range of tones
These earbuds are rather good at coming close to those ranges
Certainly more than I need for everyday listening
The free snap pouch that comes with, is a bit small and will tangle the cords
I would suggest a small clam shell case if you are going to just toss them in your backpack as I do
The cord is short
I guess this is handy when you are just attaching a player to your arm, but I use my computers as my player most of the time and it is necessary to have a small extension cord so I can move around in my office chair doing the usual office tasks
Overall, this is a great choice for quality and value
I shelled out 34 bucks, but I think a fair price would be around $20-24US
Not because of any short comings, but lets be real about the lifetime of such products being fairly short when you know there is going to be a break in the tiny wires before very long, and you can prolly get the same item in China for 3 bucks
I like how it comes with different sized covers for the ear buds so they can fit any ear, my fiance's ears are a tad off so he has to use one bigger end and one smaller end for his ears and once you get the seal with the ear buds and your ear he says they work great for base driven ear phones
Excellent headset, compact and perfect sound
The price is also very good and makes the cost X benefit ratio is extremely good
The delivery was made within the stipulated time and without any problems
After my last Koss earbuds died on me after a year, I went to find a replacement
I tried some cheaper Skullcandy but they were not any good because if I moved, all I could hear was the noise from the cord
Thankfully I use my earbuds all day sitting at my desk so I'm not putting any stress on them, but this was still not acceptable
I could have gotten the same Koss again but if they couldn't last long, I decided to try to find better ones
I read many great reviews about Sennheiser earbuds and finally decided on this model
They do a great job blocking outside noise but it's like I have my equalizer turned up with all bass
I tried settings on my computer music player but it's still muffled bass
They are comfortable to wear all day long and they do have a little bit of cord noise
I'll stick with them though as I don't want to have to keep trying different ones just to find a decent pair
I think next time I replace the earbuds and find a good pair, I'm going to then go buy a few more just so I'll have them as replacements
I purchased this to replace a similar set of Sennheiser earbuds I was quite pleased with
They sounded great in my new Samsung Galaxy 4
0 Android MP3 Player, but broke quickly
I had only listened to them about 5 mintues before the Galaxy accidently slipped out of my breast pocket and landed on the table
The Galaxy was OK but the CX300B's odd-shaped stereo plug now has an intermittent connection
It's a throwaway now
The player must have landed on the CX300B's plug
The 90-degree angle plug on my old Sennheisers would have taken the blow without a problem
This earbud's "banana" angle stereo plug is unnecessarily susceptible to damage from dropping your phone or MP3 player
Minus 3 stars for the poorly engineered stereo connection plug
Otherwise, the earbuds are top-quality
Love these earbuds
I have only one complaint (and it's sort of odd): When I wear these earbuds while walking, I get a lot of line noise
Sometimes I get a whistling noise translated up the line
I've never noticed this before with other earbuds
Otherwise, these are great
Very comfortable and good, clear sound
These are one of the best headphones that i have
They are much better then my Ibeats (http://www

The cost me only 35

While the Beats cost 99

i am very critical when it comes to my personal sound equipment
i believe you get what you pay for
i currently use the bose qc15 over the ear headphones when i travel by plane, or at home while playing my guitars
at the request of my daughter this past christmas, i was asked to get a quality set of earbuds, for around $100 for her boyfriend
after doing the research, it was clear that the cx300b mkll would be a good choice
last week when i went to her graduation, i was able to listen to these things
within minutes, i was ordering my own pair
i was impressed how comfortable these things are
i primarily use for when walking
around 2 hours per stroll
it is my honest opinion, that dollar for dollar, these could very well be the best value on the planet when it comes to the in ear type
beware of imitations as there are some folks out there that will do anything to make a buck
ha,ha,ha
stick with one of the authorized dealers
you will pay around 60 to 70 US dollars
i insist on the best quality in any audio component
such as, carver amazing plats
sunfire amp and processor, fender stratocaster, fender precision bass, infinity sub, crate guitar amp
just to give you an idea of how good i believe the sennheiser`s to be
The sound quality of these earphones is great but mine are starting to break down within 6 months of buying them
Two parts of the cord wear down easily: (1) the right-angle elbow where the rubber meets the copper jack, and (2) the rubber part where the cord meets the ear buds
I'm a little disappointed given how much I paid for them
These headphones have left me speechless, they are incredible
Usually I am a fan of over the ear headphones, but this time, I decided to buy In-ears because I needed to be able to carry them around in my pocket to listen to my iPod
I wasn't expecting much, considering they are quite small
To my surprise, they are clear, bass boosted, and can get really loud with no distortion at all
These have more clarity, more capability, and more awesomeness than iBeats, and beat out alot of other headphone brands as well
I use my Senn's everyday and I bet you would too
Great product
I just got these today and I can honestly say I am amazed
Before these came, I thought those high-priced Dr
D earbuds were amazing
Now that I've listened to music with these Sennheisers, I can honestly say that the higher-priced alternatives are way over priced and don't come close to the musical experience of these Sennheisers
The bass has a great rumble without sounding distorted, and you can still hear the mid-range and high-range sound elements
I can also attest to the fact that they do block a LOT of noise when you put them in your ear
Without music playing, you can hear roughly the same amount of ambient sound as if you put earplugs in
With music playing, you can't hear anything going on around you
An added bonus: these don't seem to make much noise for anyone except the listener, meaning you can crank your music up at work without disturbing your coworkers
I had a pair of Sony earbuds previously that sounded pretty good, but they let enough sound out that my coworkers would get annoyed with me (the same thing happens with my iPod stock earbuds)
These Sennheisers are a dream come true
Pick up a pair and find out what you've been missing
while these have very good sound I have gone thru 3 pairs as the area where the cord meets the ipod seems to be prone to breaking
i don't expect ear buds to last forever but the last 2 pairs (all purchased on Amazon)lasted 3 months or less
I really like this headset
I've had it for almost a mount and I'm really satisfied with both physical quality and signal fidelity
The Bass is awesome (it's just like you have a sub woofer in your head)
Also the qualities of the wire and carrying bag are great
To make long story short, you get much more than what you pay
Enjoy the ride
I have used so many ear-phones in the past several years
None was really good enough cross all music types until I found this one
This is my 4th pair of this product
I got the first pair 3 years ago after extensive research
I have to say, my research paid off
I absolutely loved this one
got the second pair for my girl-friend
Now got another two for my parents
If I have to buy another one, it has to be this as well
After each purchase of this one, I immediately put it in my wishlist again in case i need to get another pair for any reason
Thank you so much Sennheiser for create such a wonder at such reasonable price
I have used at least 9 different brand earbuds in the past 4 years
This one is absolutely "the One" I have been looking for for a long time
The dynamic rang is just perfect for me
I listen to a lot of classical music, as well as musical and soft rock, alternative
This baby is just perfect for all
From Andrea Bocelli to Garth Brooks, royal philharmonic orchestra to U2, 2 doors down
The sound quality of every range is very well-balanced and each is extremely vibrant, rich, warm and clear
The construction is also very impressive and thoughtful
The only complain I have is that in the past 3 years, the Carring case is no-more (which is useless anyway for me), but the price hiked almost 10$
But the quality of the buds themselve is just as every bit as good as before
I have recommended this one to lots of my friends in the years since I got my first pair
Bravo
I bought these after returning a Skull Candy headsets which were a huge disappointment
I don't know if I would have appreciated the Sennheiser's as much had I not bought the Skullcandy first
What a difference
These are simply amazing headphones for the price
I use the phone a lot and I really noticed a difference  him the microphone quality, especially when compared to the Skullcandies
There is simply no comparison
The Skullcandy would completely lose audio in windy conditions or loud ambient noise
The Sennheiser is not even affected
When listening to music, the quality is very good and clear, the earbuds are fitting nicely, it is really a very nice headset
Well worth the price
would buy them again any day
1
It doesn't have a carrying case2
It says cx300 instead of cx300B mk II, but what i've received is CX300, which is a older version
headphones are different from the web picture
This was my second pair to suffer the same fate
The sound from this product it exceptional
The noise canceling really works well
even on noisy flights
My problem is how fragile these headphones are
I am very delicate with my headphones and always take time to carefully put away in my carrying pouch
After just 3 months the sound kept crackling in one ear bud
If i moved the cable attached to the ear bud slightly the sound would work fine then cut out
(loose connection)Sennheiser has a good reputation and make good products I just found my experience not so good
>>>>>YMMV<<<<<
These are the best sounding earbuds I've ever heard
Simply put, Amazing
The cord seems to be a little long, but that's the least of my worries
I recommend these highly
The price is pretty fair too, considering how good they sound
As far as shipping and packing, I've never had a problem going through Amazon
Knock-on-Wood
The sound quality is OK, better than iPod earbuds, and much more comfortable to wear (which is why I bought them)
The one thing that bothers me is all the thumping sounds you get when moving slightly while wearing them
If you move the cord, or brush it with your clothes, you get a loud booming sound in your ears
I've never had real in-ear headphones before, so I'm not sure if this is normal, but I've never had to deal with it with other headphones in the past
It helped me to wrap the extra cord from the right-side earbud (all that extra cord bouncing around was a big part of the issue) around the back of my neck and then around to the right ear (audio source is to my right)
Once I did that it took more than a subtle vibration or brush to make the cable boom, I had to whack the cord to get some sound out of it
If this works well, I'll probably go with a cable-tie fix to make the cords the same length
EDIT: Wrapping the bud wires behind the ears, like you're supposed to do (d'oh
) does help, but it's still a LITTLE "boomy" when you move
Overall though, it's not a problem
Also after using these for a year they're holding up very well
The squeeze-to-open purse they store in works great and keeps everything together and relatively untangled
Highly recommended
These earbuds were on a magnificent sale around this past Christmas: 24
99
With a bit of research, I determined that I could not get a better deal
When I first received these ear buds, I was disappointed with the asymmetrical wiring; clearly they are aimed for someone intending to have the wire run behind their body as opposed to the front
Needless to say, I worked with it
Honestly, the sound pumped out of these was very good, probably the best I had used at the low price point
After two weeks, and one hard tug though on the wiring(dropped HTC phone with them connected,) the stereo jack molding separated from the black covering on the wiring, thus exposing them to the elements
Within one day of further use, there was a great loss of bass and volume in one of the ears
After another week of use and electrical taping, the issue affected both channels and now they are no longer used
As stated in the title, I was very pleased with my purchase until an accident resulted in them crapping out
For something that I assume is marketed toward "active-minded individuals," it certainly wouldn't cut it if I did jog with these and dropped my iPod or something as I was using them
On the plus side, the ear buds saved my phone from a potentially nasty fall
I guess that is the pro here
After using twice, for 2 hours each on the airplane to/from work, the rubber piece over the plug on the end fell off
These earphones sound very great
Crisp and clear, with a very controlled bass
Fits nicely in the ear canal, and is good for long hours
After shopping around online for some reasonably priced earbuds that deliver good sound quality, some sound isolation, and good portability, I settled on these Sennheiser CX300s
I have had the headphones for about two months, and they are sound upgrade compared to my $10 Sony around-the-ear-phones
I have found the buds to be very comfortable compared to buds I have had in the past
I don't have issues with them moving around too much or falling out of my ears during routine walking, standing, sitting (I use them during my commute to work)
The asymmetrical design wouldn't have been my first choice, but so far it hasn't bothered me
As far as the downsides go, the only issue I've had is cord noise
As you can probably tell from the description, the cords for the CX300s are very thin
I have mitigated the noise by clipping the cord to something to reduce movement
Depending on the kind of music or audio you are listening to and what you are doing, the noise is annoying or not noticable at all
I would recommend these headphones as a good fit for someone who needs a comfortable pair of earbuds with good sound quality for everyday non-exercise related activities
As a word of caution to online buyers, I would not recommend ordering these phones from third party sellers other than 'Amazon
com'
If you do, you will not be able to submit them to Sennheiser for warrenty related repairs or replacements
seriously didn't last that long, quality is really low here
and it even sounded weird as well
and the controls stop working
I think I've cornered the market on these earphones
And no I'm not willing to sell any of them
I will never have to go without
Got the timely, but sadly they hv already stopped working
Wish theyd lasted longer
Look like the real thing though
Easy to manage volume
Good, quality sound
Fits well in ear
Doesn't hurt ear
Small enough to fit anywhere
Doesn't take up a lot of room
The item was exactly what I ordered
The head phones were in excellent shape and was exactly what I needed
I broke my originaly earphones that came with my phone so I ordered these to replace the one I broke
it's a decent earphone for the iPhone
Work great with my ipod 4th gen
Music goes up really loud, just like i like it
Fits snug in my ears and don't tend to fall out with some movement like others would
the ability to control the volume is well worth the extra few bucks to pay; i now just use these while working out
Did not have a working mike which was why I bought it
IT CAME TO ME BROKEN AN I ASKED FOR A NEW ONE< PAYED FOR A NEW ONE AND GOT A USED ONE
I bought these as a backup pair
and because I didn't need them, I didn't open them for 5 months
Now that it's past the return date, I find that one of the ear buds is broken (the "screen" over the bud is off) and utterly inoperable
VERY disappointed - it should not matter from whom you buy things on Amazon, they should arrive in usable condition
I've written to the vendor and hope to get a full replacement at no charge
Hopefully, they will stand behind their product
we'll see what really happens
i like it
thnx
My daughter loves these
She really doesn't like the newer style of earbuds and these are becoming harder to find in the stores
Still using it old version or not
They work for me
Excelent
These used to be okay headphones
Buy earpods
Sound control didn't work
As described
Timely arrival
Good
It's good
I recomended
Great
my son really enjoy using them
He's always wanting me to order him more because he uses them a lot
It's OK for what you pay, but they usually don't last that long
I've bought two of these and in both cases, I've lost the connection to one of the buds after few months
Stay away from this product if you want to use it at the gym, because the seal around the ear-buds come off after few weeks, due to sweating
Microphone is not working :(
One earbud broke
fast shipping works great exactly what I was looking for
The audio is loud and I like it because when I turn on my music, I have problems nor do I have worries
The earphones I received are not original Apple earphones, and you can tell by the quality of the sound
Didn't work that well, and sounded horrible
Not too shabby
They are great for the price and they were delivered lickity split
I don't feel they are EXACTLY the same quality as a pair I might buy from The Apple Store but I would pay much more from Apple also
I would buy again and thinking about ordering some in a few minutes
I have a teenager and he goes through them like a box of cereal so for the price it doesn't hurt so bad if you lose them
Very good quality
Fast delivery
Recommended
I  was satisfied with my I phone ear buds, however I only had them for less than a month
They were caught in the door of my car, and plug was bent
I hope to get another one soon
This earpiece is the BEST next to a Bluetooth
I lost the earpiece that came with my phn and was happy to see these work just like the original
Purchased 3 old style Apple headphones they sound ok but I noticed that the cableis smaller diameter,I suspect a knockoff
It was exactly what I wanted and needed
They work great and are well priced
Would definitely recommend it to people around me
I have the real version of these headphones which came with my phone
They sound good
And under regular circumstances they fit okay
But working out in them drove me crazy
The remote causes the wires to bounce the buds right out of your ears
I couldn't get through an entire run without wanting to rip these things off and stomp on them
I've replaced them with the Panasonic RPHJE120P In-Ear Headphone and I'm much happier now
The microphone doesn't work on any of the 3 units I bought
The wires came out on one, and another the ear buds fell apart
what a waste
This wasn't durable at all
It didn't last more than 2 weeks before I wasn't able to hear out of one of the ear bugs
You get what you pay for,
Honestly, these are not my favorite for a number of reasons, but I almost always choose them over my other pair simply because of the remote
This is basically essential if you are working or doing other things will listening because as long as you have what you want on the same playlist you won't need to stop what you are doing to take your iPod out and change the song or volume
This may not matter if you have a nano or shuffle strapped to your arm or belt, but if you keep it in your pocket then a remote is perfect for preventing the iPod from becoming a distraction
However, I should say that the sound quality isn't that great and they don't stay in my ears very well if I am moving around at all, so overall it could be better and I suppose the news they just came out with would fix these problems, so you may want to go with those instead
These are really nice for an iPod touch
The best feature is the abililty to pause or play, without having to take the iPod out of my pocket, unlock the screen, navigate to the Now Playing, and hit pause
Anyone who needs good earphones, I would recommend this product to you, it has worked excellently for me so far and I am sure that you would enjoy using this product
I love that I can answer the phone, turn up/down the volume of change songs with the easy clip but as with most ear buds they slide out of my ears when I move to quickly
I keep having to re insert them
I finally ordered the clips that go over your ears to hold them in place
I wish they could make a better ear bud that stays put and delivers headphone quality sound
I followed other reviewers recommendations and bought the Earphones that were sold by Amazon
After 3 months the right ear phone no longer works, Amazon won't return and I have no way to return to Apple
The cord is a thinner gauge than the originals I had for my Iphone 4, and I probably would have been better off buying the $1
95 pair vs this $23 dollar pair
Instead of looking at these 'Genuine Apple Products' from Amazon buy directly from Apple
At least you will be able to return if there happens to be a defect
The left ear bud was buggy from the get go and finally just quit working all together after one long trip on a plane
Just get some $5 headphones that won't bother you when they break, because they all break eventually
Will recommend only use original headphones
Good quality and not very expensive
Use good products if you want to hear good music
I love these headphones
I'm a sucker
Steve Jobs got me early with his college student discount and musically relevant software paired with excellent visual design
I can't imagine anything but a white cord
What would I do without volume control and a speaker for my iPhone in case I get a call while rocking out
Just buy them now, you know you're going to get cheaper ones and be dissatisfied, and end up spending more when you eventually come back to buy these
These headphones are definitely knockoffs
They lasted about 3 months before breaking
After a few months the cord started to separate from the connector
Eventually there was a short in the connection
These have a better mic then most headsets, but they just aren't durable enough
The rubber falls off, the ear buds fail over time one at a time
Solid earphones
work well with my verizon iphone 4
Exactly like they ones that came with my phone initially
Buy
the description is correct, these are apple earbuds and the volume controller and mic work correctly
I just hate how they fit
I dislike the material which causes them to tangle uncontrollably and hard to untie
I tried to buy earbud covers, which are rubber things that fit over and into your ear but they just suck
If you're buying earbuds, just go buy some cheaper gel earbuds and you don't be disappointed
Not exactly the same quality as the apple headphones, but they still work very nice and I'm currently listening to music with them right now
When I purchased these headphones, I wasn't sure if they were going to be the actual Apple headphones
But when they came, and I saw that they were indeed the actually Apple headphones as seen in the picture, I was relieved
They even came in the Apple headphone box
I've had mine now for about a month and a half, and I havent had any problem with them
I am very pleased
Thank you
The headphones are fine, good price, they started to glitch out a little after a month when you use the remote
Don't fall for this, it is guaranteed tho have problems like the first ones I ordered never arrived so I had to order more and those didn't even work
I would give this a rating of zero if I could
A dirty open iPod box with instructions were shipped to me with no ear phones
30 bucks plus shipping is a lot to pay for an iPod box
As an Amazon store vendor I intend to get reimbursed
I'm absolutely disgusted
I brought the refurbished version and it worked like it was supposed to
However, it did die really quickly BUT I do listen to my music on very high volumes and probably took poor care of the product
The first one lasted 2 - 3 months before it just completely stopped working
The second one lasted a little over a month and now music only comes out of one side
I am seariously pissed these are NOT actual apple earphones
I chose this seller beacuse it was around the price of real ones so I figured,"ohh there probably real, I mean the price is about rite so i'll buy these" DONT BE FOOLED
It's a total rip off
The mic+remote doesnt even work,it really sucks to be ripped of,I am prety young and this is the first time i,ve been let down on amazon
These headphones are terrible
I originally ordered a pair and when they arrived the remote didn't work
I asked the seller for another set and to their credit, they sent a replacement within a few days
However the new set  only worked for a few days before breaking AND in that time, managed to destroy something in the sound jack of my iPhone so it now behaves as though there are headphones in at all time
This means all speakerphone or stereo functionality of my iPhone has been destroyed
the head phones were not generic i phone or apple head phones but they did have some good sound to them while they lasted unfortunately they broke very quick but the customer service was really good and caring and refunded my money with out asking to return the item if the head phone piece that covers the speaker had not broken so quick these could have lasted a while and would have been good enough to compete with the original apple head phones
i say try them buy them and see what u think for the price they really are a great buy
Great, Just like it came from the Apple Store
The first headphones that actully are they real thing
Worth it
the damn thing's left earphone was blown, and the damn mic wouldn't work properly
i want a new one
i just want a new one
i can't believe i spent money on this crap
give me a new one
Got this to replace my wife's apple earbuds
The original's mic went out
New ones are working great
Never sure about non- Apple products working correctly, so we went for the originals
I never really had a problem with the headphones that Apple packaged with their iPods or shuffles, but ever since they introduced the iPhone and they started putting that "clever" little inline remote on them, I've hated them
The call quality through the microphone could be better, but worst of all are the sharp edges on inline remote
I type at work and when I turn to the left to look at my document and then look back at my screen the edge of the remote always snags on my shirt lapel
If they had just round the edges a little bit it wouldn't be so bad
I have no problem with the audio quality or the fit of the ear buds, but this snagging drives me nuts
It's been a while since I've ordered these
Ha
Seems every review has my dog in it, however, once again I ordered this product because my dog ate my last ones, chewed the speaker right off
Work well real Apple product
Does exactly what I needed it to do
I use them everyday because I hate to hold my phone and talk on it
This product wasn't a good quality
Apple's ear buds material is soft and rubber
The material on this product was hard plastic
I don't beleive it was the original, but a cheap reproduction
Nothing but a piece of junk
The volume buttons do not work at all
Bad product, poor quality
Got them for my new iPad
Didn't work right out of the box,sending them back the same day for refund
Should have ordered them from the Apple Store
Really upset with Amazon for allowing such junk to be sold under their name
Bought 2 pairs (seller was AMAZON, not a 3rd party seller)
On one, the mic and volume buttons stopped working after a week, and it now when I pause it, it sometimes unpauses itself a few minutes later
The other pair, worked for about 2 months and then the right earbud volume went way down
I did notice that the main wires of the two sets have slightly different thickness
In any case, these are not the quality equipment that iPods used to come with
Maybe Apple hates making earbuds and wants to wean us off of them
removing the foam covers didn't stop us using them, now they design them to break after a month of use
Or maybe Amazon is selling knockoffs
Great quality I heard that it's very durable and stuff Another thing is I love he remote control about now I dont have to pull it out to change a song
Sound quality is poor
Bought them for a mother's day present for my mom to use with her smartphone, and the headset part doesn't even work
I am extremely annoyed with this company
I lost my iPhone4 earphones/w
mic and needed a replacement fast
I went to Best Buy and was astounded to see they were $39 while the Apple store was selling them at $29
Not being near an Apple store I ordered the headphones at ~$23 from Amazon - making sure that Amazon was the actual vendor
I am happy to say it came fast and sealed in a genuine Apple retail box
It works exactly like the earphones purchased directly from Apple, and is exactly as listed and pictured
Note: clicking on the BUY button on the product page it doesn't always mean that you are actually buying from Amazon and not from a 3rd party vendor
You have to look carefully to see who is actually being listed as the seller
If you want the real thing and not some knockoff, buy from Amazon as the actual vendor
Click on the buying options link to see all the different sellers
I am surprised at the large number of people who give one star reviews for poor quality knockoffs but don't bother to list who they bought the earphones from so that buyers can stay away from the vendors selling fakes
Anyway if you buy from Amazon as the vendor you WILL be getting the real thing, the same product you'll get from an Apple store or other Apple Authorized retailer
If you buy from any one else especially if it is unusually cheap, most likely you are getting an imitation at a much lower quality
As for the quality of the genuine Apple headphones, I have had several pairs over the years and not once did my headphones break, fall apart or have bad sound quality
I usually lose them before that happens
They don't have the quality of sound of the ~$100 high end earphones, but in my opinion they are easily the best in the $20-$30 range
The mic also works quite well for calls and is even good enough to give decent accuracy when using it for the Dragon Dictate (remote mic app)
didnt expect much for price, but they work decent enough for my needs
im pleased for the price
would buy again
I like these ear buds
The ones that are made by Apple have a thicker cord and last a lot longer
thanks
Great quality headphones, these are the only in-ear headphones I use because they are comfortable and stay in place while working out
Good quality, A bit uncomfortable to use for a long period of time
Altogether good quality
Highly recommended as cheaper alternative
I am very happy with my new earphones, these ones are the real deal
Great sound & mic quality
Thank you
I got these because it had the microphone and remote
But it doesn't even work with my computer
Looks like i'll have to pay the Apple prices to get what i need
I'd give 2 1/2 stars but can't
I love it so excite
I will order again if I need more
it so nice
it working very well
I have a older ipod and it was very hard to get a pair of earphones with the controller on it
I looked on this site and there it was
When I received it, I was very happy, because it was exactly what I wanted and needed
Thanks for having everything
This site is awesome
PROSSound quality is about 6/10 they have no bass, The sit really well in the ear without falling out
I'm a sound type person so u get what up paid for
CONS  NO BASS,  TANGLE EASY, Sound isIs not great
OK headphones
Bought these for my son
He liked them while they lasted
I think they would have lasted longer if he knew how to take care of his earphones
These were better than I expected
This item work perfect, it's sounds great, the problem it that i would like to use the remote with androids phones and tablets
I have a tendency to destroy headphones by getting the cord caught on something while walking or accidentally crushing the ear pieces in one way or another, so it was nice to get these at a decent price
These headphones work perfectly and are just as good as the newer version in my opinion
Very Clean
Amazing

It isn't the official apple brand headphones (which I expected), but it looked and functioned just like it when I got it
After a week one ear bud stopped working and then the microphone
I had to toss it soon after
DO NOT BUY
There are definitely better sounding headphones out there that have a mic
I recommend sony's noise canceling one's, they are so much more comfortable in your ear
I bought them like a year and a half ago and they still work perfectly
This is better than I expected but are alike the ones you can find at walmart
The audio is good and so far nothing is falling off
I will update within a month to see the progress of this product, then will see
:)
This product is not the original one from Apple
It is a scam
, just an imitation that it is not working properly
the product was great, works perfectly and as described
the headsets arrived on time as it was mentioned, microphone piece works perfectly as well
Highly Suggest This Product
I read lots of reviews trying to be sure I wouldn't get a look-alike product but hopefully still get a good deal
I really like my Apple earbuds: I am satisfied with the sound and I especially like the controls on the mic which work flawlessly
The earbuds I received have a hard plastic cord where my originals from the store have a rubbery cord
Also the ones from Amazon have hard plastic around the earbud where mine have a rubbery edge which helps them stay in place
Lastly, the mic control feels different, more hard edged, and doesn't have the same gray color in the middle so they obviously aren't the same
They do work and they were a little cheaper, but I might as well have bought one of the really cheap earbuds if I was going to pay so much more and still not get what I want
I'm not returning them because it's just too much trouble, but I'll buy some in the store and save these for the next time I damage the cord
(I always damage it near where it plugs into the iphone because it gets pulled out a lot when I cook :/)So I can only suggest you buy yours from Apple or directly in a store if you want to be sure of what you are getting
If some truly recent edition originals are sold on Amazon, I wish someone would post the link cause I couldn't find it
I'm actually using them while I write this review
The music is herd very clearly, the quality so far seems to be good
It doesn't look like the one in the picture though, but no matter, it works great, sounds great and so far, I am a happy customer
Did I mentioned that it arrived way earlier than it was estimated to do so
Well, it did
For that and the other before mentioned reasons, I give it 5 stars
I'm one happy customer
(And no, I am not being paid for this, just my honest review)
I have tried several type of earphones and like the Apple earphones better
I have several pair of them to use for differant occasions
Bob
An OEM Apple product that works perfectly
No bad issues
Amazon sells it at a good price
Would purchase it again
These headphones are great because they have a controller/mic on the cord that allows you to speak and control functions of your device without taking it out of your pocket, however, this does break
What are you going to do
Ok this review got a 4/5 because I don't know if these are the real deal headphones but if they are fake they are pretty decent fakes id reccomend other headphones but if you want some white head phone like the rest of the Apple drones go ahead and buy some of these
I received these earphones as promised, the packaging looked fine
In fact, even completely authentic
After extensive research (or so I thought) I figured I would be safe ordering these earphones when the Seller is Amazon LLC, however, NOT true
Although Apple products are needlessly pricey, most earphones that have the speaker/remote control function all run in the $25+ range, so I figured why not go back to the Apple product but of course try to find it cheaper online
My mistake
Should have just gone to the apple store
My factory original ones sadly died over time as the internal wire was severed by my own carelessness (I ran over it with my desk chair and have recalled stepping on it too)
So, I figured second go round, I'd stick with Apple and be more careful
To pick up where I left off, the packaging is pristine, same box, shrinkwrapped and even included the pamphlet for limited warranty and once you take out the headphones they're wrapped with that thicker plastic that has the sticky tab to keep it shut
The earphones themselves look so legit that I didn't think to look closer, even down to the "China" stamp toward the bottom of the wire closest to the jack
It wasn't until less than a week later that I started doubting these earphones
During some songs, in the lower registers, I would hear this weird crackling sound (I would describe this noise as radio static that can intermittently be very high-pitched
imagine that filtering in your ear canal) and it would fluctuate in volume, so much that at it's loudest it was painful to keep the earbud in my ear
After a few painful seconds it would go away
That was one occurrence
Now about 3 days after the first time that happened it happens ALL THE TIME
I live in NYC so I constantly am in transit and in order to filter out the city's noise, I'm always listening to music or talking to people on the phone
with my earphones
To have this happening is not only inconvenient (now I have to return these, wait for my refund and go out and buy another pair) but also painful
Upon closer inspection, I've found two indicators that show me these are not real (despite it's very authentic packaging):1)the screen over the earbud (for lack of a better word to describe that mesh material covering the little speaker)is transparent
or at least not as opaque as the factory issued headphones are, meaning I can see what the interior looks like in detail vs the real Apple ones you cannot see anything
2)the area where the connector jack is (the part that plugs into your iPod/iPhone)
My factory original ones had this rubbery part that was flexible and through wear and tear finally tore and I tore the rest off (my guess it was supposed to protect the part where it connects from fraying
)
Well, the replacement headphones do not have that flexible rubbery piece there at all
So, in conclusion, maybe others may have had a happy ending with their faux "Apple" earphones but I certainly didn't
Serves me right to have purchased these online, all to save a few bucks
I gave it 2 stars because the packaging was so damn real looking, I had to give them points for the effort
However, the craftsmanship/quality does not measure up to the real Apple product
I believe that this set of headphones was of very high quality and it has lasted me a long time
The only downside is that, this seller is from China, it took 3 weeks to get to PA from there
But its still very worth the wait and well worth the price I paid
Its is very simple
DO NOT BUY
These are not Apple Earphones, they do not have they same quality and they are not worth your money
These work exactly like the regular earphones
I have not had a problem with these yet and I've had them for a couple of weeks now
At first I thought that they didn't work and was about to get so incredibly mad until I realized that I did not push in the jack all the way
Stupid
But to my great surprise, everything worked
Happy with this purchase
I actually made a mistake I redeemed 4 US Amazon gift cards instead of Canadian Amazon gift cards since I live in Canada
I had to pay $5
00 shipping which was USPS First-Class International Shipping and Amazon shipped these out on November 14th and it checked my mail on November 25th
So these may have shipped in less than 11 business days which was fairly fast
These earphones are very authentic
They are the exact originals that came with the iPhone
I am very satisfied 5/5
I would recommend this to anyone

Shortly after writing my first review, the headphones fell apart and ceased to work
I have since bought a real Apple set and the difference in quality is striking: this item's construction is only enough to fool a casual observer's first glance (whereas they use the real Apple photo)
This item is nothing less than a fraud and will only hold together long enough to be shipped, opened, and used once or twice
In the words of my uncle, "Whoeva serr dis to you mus stirr be rrafing
"
I purchased these from Amazon and they were the same as the ones that came with my iPhone
If you get it from vendor and it's significantly cheaper than from Amazon they are probably not made by Apple
They came with 'very-apple' packaging
Using them as I write this review, very happy with them
Great sound for a cheap price and the mic sounds great
Caution these are not apple original but made to be used with the ipod
they work perfect
good headfone and work good thanks alot for the headfone i really like them and they work good and they are loud
I got the genuine apple earphones with this order
I absolutely love having the freedom to keep my iPod in my pocket and control it with the remote
I would give this 5 stars if the damn remote didn't break so frequently
Great headphones comfortable and great sound I challenge you to find better headphones
Please let me know if you do
I like just being able to plug and play
No sync required
Good sound quality
The only problem is that the white color makes them easily identifiable by theives
Would love for apple to make these in more colors
When I ordered these headphones, I was worried that these were not Apple earphones as some reviews stated they recieved non-apple headphones
Gladly, these came in their Apple packaging with the apple warranty included
These aren't Dre headsets, but for the price they work as well as I need them to work
This is the same headphones that comes from Apple
It came in an apple box just like they have in the apple store
Buy with confidence
I use a program called TextFree on my iTouch
You can make voice calls and these earphones with the mic work perfectly
I recently went to the UK and made calls using the earphones and the sound quality was great
I would recommend them
Great product, amazing sound, exactly as described, in new box, got item as described in a quick fast manner
Very impressed with service, thanks again
The packaging and logo looks real but when you get the earphones they fall apart way too quickly
It was a waste of money since it only took a week for one side to stop working
The earphones that come with Apple products - now those are the real sturdy worth the buy deal
I got it for my girl friend and she hasn't made an complaint
yet I could be wrong she don't use it much
This item is real and it's very important to me
In other words, it's just Apple earphones
I rate it 5 stars
I received this a day early which is great
When I opened the package, these were in original Apple packaging
So far they have worked fine although I have only had them for a couple of days
But these were definitely Apple earphones
I'm very glad I spent the extra money and bought directly from Amazon to avoid fakes
these suck
dont buy them
my remote died after the 36th day
so yeah no refund or exchange after 30 days
piece of crap
might be confused with some others i bought at same time, but both worked pretty well
Have had no problems and came back and bought some more
They have held up about same sounds quality (to me) as the ones that come with the iphone and the button on the strand works just the same, only problem is i sweat a lot and can't use em when I workout as the sweat malfunctions the button after a while
I bought these earphones for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift
He took really good care of the earphones and used them frequently
Four months later, the remote part does not function anymore
I do not recommend this product
I receive item on time and speakers work but I am unable to use it speak to anybody they don't hear me
these Apple earphones are a cheap knockoff and very poor quality, probably made in some third world nation
when removing the plug from the iphone it came part
Total garbage
I had somewhat high expectations of this product apparently
The day I got them, while merely walking down the stairs, the clicker fell apart and parts were never found
I though, forget it, I'll just use them as regular headphones
But that didn't work either
Due to whatever fell apart in the clicker, the wiring must have gotten bad also because from that point on it would constantly zap my ear
I threw them away
On day one
I purchased this product from Amazon on January 20th, and it arrived the 23rd
It came beautifully secured with the REAL Apple Headphones Inside
Once I received I was a bit skeptical because some people had difficulties with the item not being the real version
I tested these on my 4th generation iPod touch, and the audio is just like the pair I bought from RadioShack awhile back, The mic and everything is also perfect
The item was definitely how Apple would have shipped it I'm sure
For all the skeptics, you can also check if your item is the newest version by checking the box
Apple's Earphones have a White Box, and on the back it says it supports : iPhone 3Gs and newer, iPod touch 2nd,3rd and 4th generations, and ipod nano 5G, 6G, and iPad Hope this helps
I had some concerns with these being some knockoff hollow non authentic earphones due to other reviews and having purchased a pair of fake apple earphones, but rest assured if these are purchased directly from amazon they are real
MAKE SURE you purchase from Amazon any other sellers might be fake, but having purchased many items in the past from amazon I had no doubts they were real and they sound great
I bought 2 of these so I could place them strategically around the house
I've been using them for almost a month and have been very pleased
Update on 6/18/12 - 6 months and both sets are still working fine
Purchase from Amazon, not a third party vendor
Apple earphones in Apple retail packaging
If this is what you are looking for this is it
Buy from Amazon and you can't loose
After reading others that left coments and reviews we decided to only purchase this certain item from Amazon
Turns out the earphones work great
I love this hearphones, they work perfectly with my iphone 3g, except for the volume control because it works with models after the iphone 3g
The volume control works with iphone 3gs and iphone 4
All the rest work perfectly
These headphones quit working shortly after I got them
It is very unusual for Apple products to break, so I am not sure what the story is here
These headphones were garbage
After this, I went and bought some real headphones at the Apple store and they have worked perfectly ever since
BUYER BEWARE
I recently bought these earphones and have had them for a little under a week, but I'm already in love with them
My previous ones that came with my iPod (without the remote) were stolen, so I wanted to find a better pair that was cheaper
I decided to purchase them from ShopCell, and I'm glad I did (hence the high rating)
The only thing I regret about them so far is that I didn't buy them sooner
Although they were the last item of my order to arrive,they still came in the alloted delivery estimate
I did see that a lot of people reviewed negatively about them, so I decided to see for myself if they were of good quality
I picked the seller with the highest positive ratings and lowest price, and ShopCell was that seller
As soon as I got them, I tested all of their functions
THe sound quality was amazing, they were genuine Apple earphones on close examination, and they came in the white Apple box and original packaging, all coiled up
I hope that they will be durable and last me a good long while, as they seem to be just fine at the moment
I'm so glad I got these, and I hope my review helps someone in the future
:D
these look just like the ones that my iPhone came from
they work exactly the same
great microphone/volume buttons
just what i needed at a great price
would def buy more
I received a product that is 100% different from the description and the pictures provided
The headphones are terrible on a whole-DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM as you will regret it
-There isn't a remote-Microphone quality is poor-Speaker quality is poor-The length of the unit is shorter than the newest model
The Apple Earphones I bought were fake
Microphone quality is very, very poor
I ran multiple test with the two earphone I purchased with a real one and it was very clear that these were fake
They are okay earphones but the sound output from the mic on the receiving end is very, very poor almost non understandable
Buyer beware: they look real and sound real, but are not
I am very disappointed and advise everyone not to buy these from this seller
These Apple Earphones with the inline controls and mic is as expected
It came in the Apple retail box and works
Be sure to buy directly from Amazon as a lot of the ones floating around on Amazon tend to be third party apple earphone knockoffs
These earphones tend to usually last me around 6 months which is a lot better than other earphones I've used with my iPhone
I have had both cheaper skullcandy earphones and ultimate ears earphones that are twice the price
Both quit functioning after 2 months
My main reason for purchasing these is simply because they last longer than the competition under heavy use
The earphone is the authortic apple earphone
I use it for skype by my ipod touch
It is very nice one
Compared to the genuine apple earphones I have always purchased (prior to these which I doubt are genuine)these leave a lot to be desired
All they are good for is listening since the mic barely works and no one can hear me on the other end
This was not after prolonged use (which does happen with genuine apple earphones) - this was how it worked from day one
This was a waste of money
I ended up in Best Buy the next day buying real apple earphones
Got the buds for about 1/3 of original Apple buds price as a spare
Advertised as Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic (Newest Version)
But sound quality of buds were really bad
One side is louder than the other
Overall sound has no punch and sounds very boxy (like there's an echo) compared to Apple original that I used to compare this to
Can't envision I can use this on regular basis to listen to music
Just what I was looking for
The best sound quailty ever
Easy to use
Love that I'm able to adjust volume
Best price
The volume buttons do not work at all
You can't adjust the volume
I advise to stay away from this product
The earphones work well
The Mic does not
Sound goes in and out
Very annoying to anyone that you are talking to
Rather misleading product description
They are earphones with remote and Mic FOR APPLE
NOT Apple earphones
Out of the box only one ear works
The controls are fine, but it is awful to listen to music with only one ear
I guess I got what I paid for since it is half the cost of Apple head phones
I was suspicious about these earphones because of the low cost and the fact that they didn't come in the rectangular Apple earphone box
These earphones are packaged as when they are included in an iPhone box, in a plastic wrap
I inspected them with a magnifying glass and compared them to the original earphones I received with my iPhone
There is no difference
I brought them to an Apple store for inspection and was told with confidence by an employee that the earphones are Apple earphones
The sound quality is identical to the original Apple earphones I got with my iPhone
Based upon this, I conclude that these earphones (I got mine from "Beast Deals") are truly Apple earphones
These are great, I use them ALL the time
In fact, they're easier than bluetooth since u just plug them in, no waiting to pair
I was surprised since these were the ACTUAL Apple ones
no gimmicks, no 3rd party
Almost hard to believe since Apple generally doesnt sell on Amazon
Very nice, I may get one extra pair too
they have a warranty for 1 year through apple for one year (if they go bad though, no physical damage) and not a lot of headphones provide that + they are replaced on the spot
I mostly use mine for talking and walking because it picks up peoples voices pretty good
Also I use mine to listen to music (SHOCKER)
Ok they are not Beats by Dre, or Sonys, or Senys but they are probably the best ear buds that are this cheap
My only problem is, when I use them to work out, I sweat out of my ear a bit and they kind of clog up the sound but surprisingly don't ruin them once they dry out
Overall, your getting what you pay for
They are not the best or the worst but they are well balanced out and this is probably the cheapest you'll find them from retailers
Í ordered this convinced that I was going to get originals
But no luck there
I am a big amazon fan, I do a lot of shoping here, but this time I must say that they blew it
The earphones I got were not originals, they didn't have a mic or anything and they're even scratched and broken
I can't talk to you about the sound, because to tell you the truth I won't dare put those things in my ear without knowing where they've been before
I decided to wait for this review, because i found previous bad opinions in this product
The product works well, each button works propperly and the sound is very good
Appearance of earphones is a little bit different to the original earphones but not too much
I lost my old earphones for iPhone 4
Purchased these as substitution
They work WITHOUT any faults so far
I would recommend this product
The earphones arrive, yes with the apple little box and everything in it
But the right earphone doesn't works, either the microphone or the volume control
I don't recommend anyone to buy from this seller
When I received my iPhone 4s, these same headphones came with my phone
I used them all the time
For about 3 days, I thought I had lost them, so I was so happy to see that I could replace them for a reasonable amount
When they arrived, (a day early
:) ) I was so glad to see that the replacement headphones were just like the ones I had lost
In fact, these are a little bit better
They are clearer and thanks to the instructions that came with the headphones, I learned they could do even more than I thought they could
I did find my "lost" headphones but still prefer these new ones
and the primary purpose I got them for includes using them for Skype
They are perfect for that
But I rate the product a 3 instead of a 5 because of Apple requiring their own proprietary headset for iPads (1 and I assume likewise for 2 and the whole line of iPhones and iPods)
Have a Blackberry headset and a Nokia headset which you would think would work but they don't on an iPad yet are interchangeable with each other
Also, in this day and age one would expect the iPad to be able to use a Bluetooth headset but that is not the case
Amazon does offer a great price for a genuine Apple headset though
Better than going to the Apple store and being ripped-off
I purchased this new from Amazon
com and got exactly what I expected
These are great headphones and are exactly what I needed to replace my worn out pair of headphones that came with my iPhone 4
My earphones were gone last year and this is a good replacement for it
The comand works perfect and it arrived on time
Thanks
Product arrived on time (fast shipment)
Item as described
Not original earphones but still good quality for the price
Thanks a lot
I'm glad I decided on these earphones out of all the knock-offs currently on Amazon
They look, feel, and behave exactly like my original earphones that broke
Sooner or later these will break too, I'm sure, and I'm happy that I now know where I can get them for 1/3rd the cost
These shipped from California and arrived in three days (I live in Texas)
I purchased two pairs of these buds for use with my new 6th Gen
Nano
Neither pair worked
the Voice Memo icon did not appear
I plugged them into my 5th Gen
Nano and they worked just fine
After a bit of research, I decided to try the latest "official" Apple buds, which I ordered from Amazon
They work just fine on my 6th Gen
Nano
The technical info on the Apple website led me to expect this result, although you have to do some serious reading between the lines
My buds that did not work on the 6th Gen
came from Kingsley although I suspect that this item is the same regardless of the vendor
The verbiage "Newest Version" seems misleading; perhaps it means "newest version of knock-off buds/mic for products up to and including 5th Gen
Nano
" I did not return them; they are dirt cheap
They are still earbuds, just without a functional mic for my purposes
)
I run 15-20 miles per week in these (in Florida heat) with my iphone 4 and haven't had an issue with sweat killing these headphones (yet)
Work just as well as apple and much cheaper
I'll buy again
*update* Just a few hours after writing the previous good review, the remote stopped working
Going back to Apple headphones
ugh
These are not "apple" headphones
Very bad knock offs and poor sound quality
Do not buy these headphones
They don't look like apple headphones either
Had no problems, item came in a timely manner and was what I expected
Would recommend them to anyone looking for cheap ear buds but good quality
Would buy again
You cannot go wrong buying these headphones
Why pay $30 retail
I got mine from Deal Tech and they shipped very fast and work great
the play/pause button has given a little trouble, which is why I gave 4/5 stars, but the quality of sound is just as good as $30 Apple headphones
My headphones arrived after only 1 week
They are working fine as headphones, but the microphone and volume remote are not working with my Android phone (it detects a headset, not a headset with mic)
I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that these features are only compatible with iPhones or if the headset is partially defective
I really just wanted a spare set of earbuds, so they suit my needs, but I am disappointed the additional features aren't working, because they would have been useful
I figured from other reviews that it can be kinda hit or miss as far as what you're going to get when you buy these cheaper headphones, regardless of whether they're labeled as being official Apple headphones or not
The version that I got was definitely NOT the retail headphones, as while they did have a remote to control play/pause, there was no volume control
The sound itself is fine, nothing special but it is fine and clear enough
I will probably return these and try my luck with one of the other innumerable knockoffs sold through Amazon, but you definitely have to manage your expectations if you're trying to get a deal
I'm not sure why everyone is upset
The headphones I ordered are excellent quality genuine Apple headphones
not knock offs
They arrived in 5 literal days (3 business days), not two weeks
and they were shipped from New York, not from overseas
I'm very happy with my order
I purchased my headphones, specifically for the mic and volume control
I received the headphones, and the pair did not have a mic or volume control
I'm sending them back today, and will not be buying from the sellers again
Have you ever got the free earphones on a airplane and realized that the quality of speakers is slightly better than the baby crying behind you
Well, that's the same thing with these ear buds
Clearly not an Apple product
You get what you pay for
*Just ask your friends who like their ear buds where they got them/the name and order those on amazon
Don't be persuaded by the price
Not being able to enjoy/hear most music and people on the phone stinks
I have bought this item used but in new condition
I can't say whats the difference in old version and in this one, besides that 10 bucks
Whatever sound is good
Don't waste your money, buy old version it's the same product
These have been the best wired headset for my HTC EVO phone, I've purchased
Calls are clear and people on the other side of the conversation can hear me despite the windy conditions
These Apple earphones are nice, they are very comfortable
You can hear your music very clear
The cord is just right
The earphones arrived on time
I would recommend these earphones
came in the retail apple product box as advertised and they are still working very well
no issues with the mic either
thank you amazon
only gripe was that the box was way to bid for the tiny item that was in it lol
i got these with an ipod touch
the cable got a short, and both earbuds blew out after 2 months of light usages
Cheap plastic, complete crap
Fine if you buy them with an ipod, you have no choice
But DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THESE CRAPPY EARPHONES
YOU CAN FIND MUCH BETTER FOR LESS
Ordered the ear buds on Monday, they arrived on Wednesday
They were in a apple box and work great
It all worked out really well
I'm leaving this review because my decision to purchase was based on the other reviews associated with the product, and I appreciated that people took the time, because they seem to have landed on these after having experience purchasing the many lousy headsets sold on amazon that have the same picture and description, but are in fact not at all like the original apple iphone headsets
so, in short, these are very similar to apple iphone headsets, and I'm grateful that i found them
i lose headsets once a month, easily, and it just drives me nuts to spend $30 at apple on them
it CAN'T cost 'em 50 cents to make these things, you know
So, coz i'm a cheap-ass- i'd troll amazon for cheap versions, and they were always unreliable pieces of junk, so i'd go back to buying the expensive apple sets
'til now
I bought several more pairs after testing that these were indeed as good as reviewed
I hope that the product sold on this link continues to be the same product that I'm reviewing here
good luck, bargain hunters
llego super rapido en perfectas condiciones me encantan super economico para el precio los pueden comprar en confianza muy buenos
First off, they said they were authentic
WRONG
They come in a box that looks like you bought them from Chinatown
I bought it for the remote and yes that works but the mic doesn't work at all
It did come quick though
and for 7 bucks what else could you have expected
looks like another Amazon seller scam
THESE ARE NOT APPLE EARPHONES
These earphones were not packaged in Apple packaging, and they are an inferior product
Shame on me for not reading the reviews which already addressed this problem
I'd lost my original iPhone 4 earbuds and was wary of knockoffs that others in the reviews cited
At the time I ordered, it seemed like a bunch of questionable retailers latched onto this description/item and presumably were selling the knockoffs (missing features and all)
I specifically ordered the ones sold by Amazon
com and not any 3rd party retailers
The ones I received seem to be genuine based on the box, packaging, papers included, etc
They were exactly in the style I've seen of other Apple products
My earbuds have all the features that my lost earbuds had and look just like [
]My advice is to order directly from Amazon, not a 3rd party reseller and if the price is too good to be true (FAR below Apple's MSRP), then steer clear
Got what I wanted, at a decent price, shipped on time
Basically you can get two for the price of one, or half off, which is a great deal
Received the headset/mic in condition as indicated and received it quickly
Would buy from this seller again
Product was in unopened original box with directions included
These are NOT Apple headphones as advertised
The ear bud fell apart within on week of moderate use
The clarity is horrible
I should have known by the price
The seller claimed the headphones were new, well it came in a used box and the headphones themselves looked used
I used them for two weeks and then they broke
I would never recommend purchasing anything from this seller
These headphone are just what I needed, AND YES THEY ARE AUTHENTIC APPLE HEADPHONES, seller shipped it the very next day
Very smooth transaction and will definietly do business with this seller again
For the price I think these are totally fine
I find the cord has a strange kinking behavior that makes them a bit hard to untangle, the remote is not all that helpful, and the sound quality is inferior to that of >$100 headphones (but what did you expect
)
These may not be the best headphones for audiophiles
If you just want a set that works and is at your door for less than $15 dollars these are hard to beat
Works great for $8
They are probably fake, because the cord is a weird texture and the earbud mesh is slightly rough on the edges, but I noticed no different in sound quality and functionality
My earphones work great
This product came way quick and I love it
The box was crushed when i recieved it but the product was not damaged and it works great
Would recommend to others
The cord- thin and easy- gets twisted easily plus the little holder to keep it in a certain spot always comes undoneremote- love how handy it is
wish it was biggerauthenticity- looks real to me
Apple usually doesn't make stuff outta crap
That being said these are some great earbuds
They also come with a year warranty I think
I got it so that I could skype with people in Russia
It works great for that, however I have small ears, and so they hurt if they're in too long
So if you've got small ears don't buy this unless you need the mic
Bad, I bought earphones, for one the remote doesn't work at all, neither the mic
For the other one the remote works but the mic doesn't
I have not had a lot of use of my new earphones yet but I've been pleased with them so far
I am very glad they have the remote feature
Highly recommend this item especially for music and movie use
These are NOT Apple brand earphones, like they're made to seem in the product page
They're only similar in that they're white and have a remote
The remote is flimsy, the earbuds are smaller (Apple ones are large enough to stay properly in my ear), and the cord is covered in a high friction rubber, rather than the slick coating that is on the Apple earbuds
Sound is OK, but I would not recommend buying these--they're not the bargain you may think
Crystal clear and work perfectly well
I am very pleased with how fast the headset came to me
I chose super saver shipping option and my earbuds still came in lighting quick
Thanks for such speedy service people
These were exactly what I was looking for
The mic doesn't work
This item is not good if you want to use to speak to people through this earphones
Very good quality, the real thing
I loose headphones like so many people loose sun glasses
I am buying more
You should also
Patrick
I Had no problems at all, i was really happy with the new headphones
There was no doubt that they were brand new
It was packaged well and was clean
Thank you
Don't waste your money
The "Mic" part is misleading
The volume control barely works
This is a piece of junk
These headphones that the seller states are Apple are NOT
They have bad sound quality and look and feel very fake
I strongly advise you NOT to buy them
The headphones are perfect
And they got here so fast
The headphones are the same kind that come in the box when you first purchase an iPhone, but are way more affordable
I purchased these because of the price, my old originals were getting worn
Found out it would take almost 2 weeks to arrive I went out and bought some originals from a local store but kept these coming for backups
In comparison to the ones i just bought they feel very brittle, the wire feels like it would break after a few months of regular use and the ear comfort strip is very hard compared to the originals
But for a third the price i think it is worth the buy, they still work just as they are supposed to and sound just like the originals
might last a little less as long but if your always losing your headphones these are a good buy
Bought the headphones from Amazon with prime
I avoided the third party sellers
The headphones were genuine apple ones
Amazons price was very competitive and I have no issues with the product
IF YOU WANT THE REAL THING BY FROM AMAZON (price will be higher) - NOT THIRD PARTY
this earphones are the best thank you some much i really like buy on amazon i try buy at ebay and i have very bad experince i never buy nothing for ebay i really like amazon and thank you some much to this seller becouse the ear phones woork great i will buy moore items for this buyer and again thank you amazon and this seller
prince
This was exactly what I wanted
The Apple headset with microphone for the iPhone
It's the same thing you'd get in the Apple store, with the great service and price from Amazon
Note: On Amazon, I always try to buy from Amazon even if it's not the least expensive solution
Amazon support is great, they'll take care of you if there's a problem, and their product descriptions are typically very accurate
I suspect this same description is used by some of the 3rd party vendors which may have resulted in people not getting what they expected
(I'm sure most 3rd party vendors are pretty good
) If the deal is "too good to be true", you may want to up your price point with another vendor
In all cases, let Amazon know if there's a problem so that they can address the issue
These are, actually not real Apple headphones
4 concrete things i've noticed about true iPod headphones (besides the fact it has a mic and the 2 peices controlling the length of the L & R cables
) is as follows
1) Located near the headphone jack on the cable, it says the word China on it
This does
i was elated because many many knockoffs lack this one
2) The colors of the cable itself is white, but slightly grey, along with the soft peice in between the jack and the cable connection
3) The jack itself is shiny white, and along the peice that goes into the audio port, it has white bands
4) The earbuds have a soft ring around the connection of the speakers and the part holding the buds
The only thing these headphones lack is the soft ring around the speakers, and while its not there these still may prove to be a great pair of headphones (Personally my main problem with ipod headphones is that if the soft ring around the headphones gets peirced, it starts to fall apart very quickly and it has been the cause of 2 headphones [60$+tax] being wasted
) I only just got them today and i'm still very happy with them
Hopefully they are as durable and long lasting as ipod headphones or better
But if you're looking for the real thing i wouldn't buy these because these are not they
it is much cheaper than the one I bought from apple store
the quality is good~ looks same as the one I bought from apple store
As others have stated, I was unsure about buying these due to the price being half of what I would pay at the Apple store
Put your mind at ease, these are exactly the same product that ships with the iPhone 4
All the same features, even the same packaging
You can't go wrong if you are looking to replace a lost or damaged set, which I was
For this price I'd buy them again, should my son some how get a hold of them
=)
Those iPhone earphones (the ones that come with your phone) are pretty fragile
I know they're not the most durable or sweat-resistant earphones on the market, but I like the remote and mic features too much to go with something else
Ever since I got my iPhone I've gone through at least 5 pairs of these things
At the store, these earphones will run you around $30
I was hesitant to buy an unrated item from a seller (Beast Deals) I hadn't used before, but for $12
88 I figured the chance to find an outlet for earphones over 50% cheaper than at the store was worth the risk, and bought it
Obviously due to my 5-star rating, I'm glad I did
The earphones do not come in a box or in white packaging like at the Apple store, but are coiled like they would be inside said packaging
The earphones are, as far as I can tell, genuine
The sizing is the same, the length of the cord seems to be the same, examination of the head and earbuds seems to indicate it's the same product
I tend to keep these earphones in my pocket with my phone, so we'll see how the life of the product is in a semi-taxing environment like that as time goes on(I take them out and put them back in my pocket several times a day every day)
The earphones seem 100% functional
Naturally I tested audio quality, remote capability, and mic capability, and all of them mirrored my earphones that I purchased at the Apple store
Needless to say I am pleased I found a place where I can buy these headphones for less than half of what I normally purchase them for
I will keep tabs on this review and come back to post if I encounter any problems with this product in the future, but at least now I'm completely satisfied and pleased with my purchase
I will definitely be coming back here to purchase replacements for myself and/or my friends and family
Hope this review helped :)**EDIT 11/03/2011**: Looks like some other customers have had problems with quality of their headphones from this page
I also see there are a lot of different vendors now selling it
Personally, with the pair I bought from Beast Deals, my pair is still going strong and working great
I even accidentally left it in my jeans pocket and put it through the wash
I was amazed that they still function perfectly (I was sure to make sure they were dry before I tried to use them)
I can unfortunately only speak to the pair I got from Beast Deals, which is a vendor I'd trust
If they're up around $12
88 still, they may not be the cheapest
Just select "16 new" (or whatever the number) under the price to see all vendor options
If I were to buy again, I will probably try a cheaper vendor first, just in case, but will go back to Beast Deals if there's a problem
Great headphones
I was skeptical not buying from the apple store
Based on reviews these looked genuine- and they were
For just aboht half the cost of headphones at the store- cant beat that
No problems yet- Ive had them for about a month
What i thought of this product at first when i had gotten it was ,awesome,but then when i opened the box,it came in a clear little bag apearing to be used when i had bought it new,so i took an even closer look and took it out and saw there there was a tiny stain on one of the earphones side where it labels which ear the earphone goes on, this shocked me but i wasnt gonna cry about it so i just got some rubbing alcohol rubbed the entire product till satisfactory and now everythings fine
Now this product is a dandy
If you go to an Apple store, this product would cost you much more than what I paid, and it works just as well if not better than the Apple product
For just a little search, I found this much cheaper product
I hate iPods
I cannot use the volume control most of time
it just simply does not work
And the wires are thinner than the original one
Regular ear buds just weren't working for me, but when I saw this item, it had everything I needed
They look great and work well
i'd love to share, but i have not yet received this item and it was ordered nearly a month ago
Purchased directly from Amazon
Right earphone developed a short within 3 days of light use
Returned and purchased Etymotic Research MC5 Noise Isolating In-Ear Earphones (Black) on a Lightning Deal
They were cheap and I waited a long time for them to come from hong kong
I thought it would be worth it since I didn't need them right away
The mic didn't work out of the box and the entire headphones feels cheap
You get what you pay for
I am going to the apple store next time
After reading Amazon reviews from individuals that had purchased ear buds that were "like" genuine Apple, but turned out to be inferior products I was concern about buying a lesser quality item than the ear buds I received when I purchased my iPod
This item was labeled as genuine Apple and that exactly what I received; they are identical to the ear buds that came with my iPod when I purchased it
Exactly what I wanted
A little pricey though, but that's Apple
I am still waiting for the headphones to show up
Great deal, right
For $12 I get the pleasure of writing this review
How do I get my money back
just what I was waiting for first class apple headphones
buy it are very nice, works nicer in all my devices
These weren't actually Apple earphones and besides, they didn't work
The seller kindly gave me a no questions asked refund
beat problems associated with microphone and remote control panel, but it works now
good headphones Apple, with a remote control and a microphone, as well as at the time, good seller
i bought this headphone thought it would have work with my iphone which it soppoesd to and didnt tries it with my friends blackberry worked there
u and answer ,skipped to music or nothing
dispointed
this product is awwesome
was super cheap and works great
lost my moms pair of these and thot i would have to shell out thirty bucks but ended up finding these for like three
aaawesome
Neither mic or volume control works
Also, you can only plug in half way
If you plug in fully, you get bad or no sound
Will, be returning for refund
I don't know if you repair them, or where you get these headphones from, but they are no good
The volume control is messed up on them, and they replaced a pair and with the new pair it was the same thing
What a waist of $19
95, I would have rather paid the $29
99 from apple themselves
That's what I get for trying to save a dollar
They're great
i got em 2 days before delivery, they work perfectly, and they're actual apple ones, they looked like they were taken right out of the iPhone 4 box and sent directly in the sleeve, which i think is good, I just would have liked them in a box you know
BEWARE: the earphones I received were counterfeit
I had them inspected by several people after the cord physically broke, then compared them to actual Apple earphones from the Apple Store
Not only are the sound quality of these knockoffs crap, but they broke after only a week of use
Definitely invest to get them directly from Apple or another trusted source
Oh, and the microphone never worked
The earphones are not very comfortable and the sound quality is poor
Also, the left one stopped working one month after I bought it
Total waste of money
I was happy to find these earphones so cheaply on Amazon
My daughter loves her Ipod shuffle but it takes these special earphones which can come with a big price tag
Once I placed the order on Amazon, my order arrived within days
Very happy
The first day I used these, the ear bud separated and fell apart
I was able to glue it back together, but I really shouldn't have had to
Otherwise they've functioned fairly well
Based on these reviews apparently these aren't really original equipment "apple"
What did I expect for 11 bucks
The picture looks like The I phone, what I got was not, it was  different not a compatible with the Iphone, very nice from the seller they refund the money
When I first got these headphones, they were on point
But the more I used them, the more people started to hear themselves on the other side of the line
They were echoing the entire coversation
When they had me on speaker or bluetooth, I would hear myself echoing through the phone
I don't know what the policy is on these headphone, but I wish I could just get a good replacement pair
Listening to music is pretty straight on them though
I hope they get better with their products
Oh and I get the merchandise a day later than it was suppose to be
That sort of pissed me off
The store was wonderful
they were very quick to stand by their product and made sure that I was satisfied with my order
I love the earphones
Its so convenient to not have to take out my phone every time I want to change the song
Got the item for a great, though still slightly overpriced price, came quickly, super fast shipping, but then received the product and the remote never worked, and also the backing fell off of it
not satisfied with it
Though it looks the part, I can't even imagine that this might be an Apple product
It arrived folded up and the cord quite badly kinked after a ride from Optimum Trade in a small padded envelope
After one frustrating phone call lasting 15 frustrating minutes, I finally gave up
Frustrated
It sounded like we were in the Chunnel at first, then he couldn't hear me unless I held the remote part up to my mouth and spoke directly into it
Contacted seller and am hoping for the best possible smooth refund
The seller send my earphone promptly and well packaged however, the earphone cord is flimsy and after only a week looks like its about to break
This product is described as Apple Earphones with remote and Mic (Retail packaging)
They arrived in a little plastic bag inside a padded envelope, with no paperwork or other packaging
That's not what I consider "retail packaging"
I expected to have something included that would help confirm that the product was indeed the one manufactured by Apple and not a knock-off version
I paid extra because of how the product was described and because I expected the actual Apple product
Now I am not really sure if it is an Apple product or not
Luckily, the earphones, mic and remote do work
If I'd had problems, I would not have had any easy way to contact the seller since there was no paperwork included - nothing with a phone number, address or instructions on how to contact them if there was a problem
The product works, but some of the cheaper, knock-off products may have worked OK, too
I just feel like I've paid extra for something that may or may not be what I was expecting
Update April 2011 - After using the earbuds a couple of times, I noticed that some of the our sheathing over the wires had pulled away from the one ear piece
I contacted them and the sent a replacement pair very quickly at no charge
They seem to be interested in making sure their customers are pleased
NOTE
BUY FROM AMAZON
DO NOT BUY FROM THIRD PARTY SELLERS
I trust Amazon
Though the headphones are more expensive if you buy from them, they are genuinely Apple
The sound quality could use some improvement
The basses are weak and the highs aren't the clearest
However, they work pretty well as casual use headphones and terribly as exercise headphones
Sweat easily gets in the remote and causes it to stop functioning
Use with caution when exercising
Using the remote is dead simple
Volume up, volume down, and center button
Click center once for play/pause music, twice to skip forward, three times to go back, and hold for voice control [if on newer iPhones (will it work for iPod touches
)]
It is very convenient for answering/making calls
The microphone yields good quality talking and listening is clear
The connector part of the microphone has changed from weak rubber to a hard plastic
However, the cord can still easily be pulled out
I would say these are decent headphones
They're good for calls and some music listening
Just be sure to buy it from Amazon and not a someone selling their product in the Marketplace
EDIT/UPDATE 9/16/2012 - You may want to check out Apple's Earpod headphones before buying these
The Earpods have better sound quality, are more comfortable, and don't fall out as easily
Update 8/22/2012 - These headphones are still working although some rubber-ish stuff is splitting
Still works nicelyQuick Note: If the product is not genuinely Apple, then don't rate the headphones
The bad reviews due to fake headphones are creating an incorrect rating
Instead, rate the seller lowly, ask for a refund, and buy the headphones from your Apple store, Target, Best Buy, Amazon (with Amazon
com as the seller), etc
I ordered two sets, one for me and another for a co-worker
I opened mine and one ear bud didn't work, the other set was opened and a day later one ear bud ceased working
I accidentally threw away the return slip, assuming they would both work
I now have 2 sets of non working earphones
Very disappointing
I made this purchase from Bogotá, Colombia, using a PO box I've got in Miami
Today I finally received my earphones and this is the worst product I have purchased, I feel STOLEN
The right earphone doesn't even work, I can't hear music
I need my money back or earphones in excellent status
Thank you
My headphone just came today, they were complete fakes, cheap wire, earbuds were hallow, and the volume and mic control dosen't even work
DON"T WASTE UR MONEY ON COUNTERFEIT HEADPHONES
So I buy two thinking these were the real OEM Apple headphones
Boy was I in for a treat
Here's the catch I bought 2 of them
One for me and one for my wife
Tried both, both has tons of static and the mic doesn't work very well
Don't buy it, spend more money and go to the Apple store
The headphones crackle and the remote does not work on the pair that I received
I would not recommend spending the money for these
I was very disappointed
Ordered Two But One Of Them The Left Ear Piece Didnt Work And The Other One The Volume Down On The Remote Was Stuck
The look and function exactly like Apple earbuds to the finest detail, however, the sound quality is noticeably lacking on these when compared to the genuine Apple equivalent
The sound lacks the depth and detail that I've come to appreciate in Apple headphones
That said, if you're not an audiophile, these earbuds still sound better than a lot of others around the same price point
Also, recordings through the mic sounded identical to the Apple product
The remote works fine, but the volume buttons don't 'click' as distinctly as the do on my previous pair; not a big deal
Can't say how durable they are as I haven't had them very long
Bottom line, I guess these earbuds are worth exactly the price I paid for them, but I was looking for something that sounded as good as my previous earbuds, so I'll keep these as a backup pair
If these aren't genuine, they shouldn't be advertised as an Apple product, and they might suffer from some quality issues if I were to use them on a regular basis
this is a true apple headset
It performs exactly like a regular apple headset, i know because i've bought plenty of them over the years
and for those of you who dont understand how the play and fast forward button work: if you press the area in between the volume buttons where the plastic dips in itll stop if you press it again itll play, and if you press it twice quickly itll fast forward
if you got a broken headset i feel bad for you and you should get a refund but the product is a true apple headset
truthfully worth the price and at half price it is definitely a steal
oh and another reason i know why they are actually apple headphones is because of the way they are packaged
only apple packages their headphones like this
This was not sold as advertised
The cord only has a volume adjustment, not a stop/play/ff feature as I thought
They are regular ear phones with a volume control
Nothing fancy
I bought these hoping to save a few bucks
I saved a few bucks but my first pair of headphones were very poor quality
I posted a review here and within a few hours was contacted by iPhonesiSell
They wanted to replace the headphones with a better quality pair
At no cost to me, they sent me another set of headphones (they didn't even require me to send the first pair back)
The headphones are quite as good as my OEM Apple pair but they are pretty close
The 2nd pair ended up making it a pretty good deal
This was a present for my boyfriend and he totally loved it
He uses it daily and works perfectly
I bought it a few months ago and its still working great
Great product for a great price
Earphones were just as described
Packages were a bit smashed, but it did not effect them at all
Great price and they're perfect
Thanks
The description does not mention this, but I got a used pair
THEY WERE DISGUSTING
Also, the mic doesn't work well for phone calls, which is the reason I wanted these in the first place
Better off going to straight to apple
I did a side by side comparison with my other headaphones from apple with mic, the difference is that the wired for this 1 is thiner and my old one's
but hey they work
had them 1hr and sound great with all the Volume up
wanted to see if they resist and they do
This guy sold me ear phones with remote and mic for ten dollars
Though, it was cheap and looked like the real thing, the moment I opened the package the mic fell off
FELL OFF
It wasnt a real mic
It was like a sticker or sumthing, as well as the earbuds, which fell off a few hours later
This guy is a scammer
The earphones volume control and the ability to change songs has never worked on this product since the fist time I plugged it into my IPOD
Unfortunately, there is no other way to change songs or control volume without this specific type of earphones
I will have to go directly through APPLE
I feel really bad about the product, it is not an apple earphone with control , it's a really poor product with pause on it
DO NOT BUY IT
Now if the speakers will last
That's what will happen to the first one
Ilove my nono shuffle and what it to last forever
but new products are developed all the time
what a fast moving world
Susan
It's not a strong pair of earbuds because in a few months it will start to break apart, so you will have to be gentle with it
The volume control is wonky now
It automatically ups the volume without my even touching it, until it reaches the maximum volume
so basically not good after just a few months
I bought these earbuds not knowing what to expect (except a much lower price than Apple)
So far I am satisfied, work well, audio fine for earbuds
First of all this is not the "NEWEST APPLE HEADSET" it doesn't have volume control the cord is already falling apart and the microphone is on the wrong side
Complete waste of my money+ it took 4ever 2 get here
Didnt even give the option 4 faster shipping
So po'd about this
Oh yeah tried using it on a phone call& it doesn't work
Everything went as expected; The Earphones were wrapped in a little plastic case and the sound quality is just as if Apple was selling them for $29 except this company sold it for only $10 plus $2 shipping :) I just got them today and there doesn't seem to be a problem yet
Only time will tell if they are durable
The great company that shipped them is Accessory US
I was very pleased with my purchase
The headphones arrived in the original Apple packaging and they work fantastically
both when listening to music and during phone calls
I ordered a new earphone set for my ipod shuffle and received a nice pair of ipod earphones but they did not have the controls on the cord
It was the WRONG
type and after waiting for close to a month for the product I felt it or this vendor was a waste of my time
I purchased a product that was advertised and got a different item in return
THIS IS NOT GOOD BUSINESS
I don't know why people gave this product a bad review
People who said their was no remote with it were probably misled or confused by what the remote is
The headphones are so amazing, they have a button on them where you can higher/lower the volume or stop/play the music on your ipod (that's what the remote is, the little button on the headphones)
The microphone is also really good
For the most part I loved this product and I was very satisfied with it, especially that I paid less for it than what I would have at the apple store
They were not compliant with my phone but the return process was very easy and the customer services was GREAT
I will continue to purchase iteams from this seller
The set I received was not the set pictured, nor was it in apple packaging
In addition, one of the ear-buds didn't work out of the package
Lesson learned
Thank you so much I received another earphones, sorry for leaving a negative feedback before informing you, thank you so much
This is same as other normal earphones and not 100% an apple product
The bass is less
But for this price its okay to use as an alternate
Definitely not OEM
The materials and quality is sub-par and looks flimsy and weak, i
e
, may breakdown or fall apart with less than normal use
Sound quality from the headphones are so-so
I bought it for the occasions that I may need this with the iPhone in a non-Bluetooth equipped vehicle
We shall see how long this thing lasts
The first set sent did not work in one ear plug, as soon as I mentioned the problem I had a replacement in 2 days
One of them started to break apart a couple of days after I began using it and the other one had a broken right headphone right out of the package
I loved the price
This was an actual purchase for a replacement pairs, and the quality is not as good as you would have paid for an actual pair at the apple store, seems you have to lift and speak right into the speaker when using the microphone as oppose to just talking normally but they definitely served my purpose as a replacement pair for my two teenagers
I would buy again for them,since they go through so many head microphones, but I wouldn't purchase for myself, because I use my iphone for business and would need the microphone to work normally
I also received it without any type of packaging, just a piece of tape to keep the cord together
The first set had the sound very muffled
It was hard to hear
They sent another pair, which microphone didn't work
We finally got a third pair that seems to be working alright now, but it took two tries
Extremely annoying
iDeal Accessories has not, to date, responded to my request to return the earphones for a refund or switch to the old version
The new version of the earphones controls are unresponsive to my mini ipod and it is so frustrating given I purchased 3 pairs from them
The sound is so low I forget its on and when I try to turn up the volume, NOTHING HAPPENS
I've sent the request twice and they haven't even acknowledged me
No bother, this will not happen again
This product had the worst audio quality of any earphones I have ever owned
Don't buy this junk
I tried to contact the seller about it twice but did not receive any feedback whatsoever
DON'T BUY FROM THIS SOURCE
I bought these from the Apple Store here in town after the pair of phones that came with my ipod (touch) broke, the sound quality seemed alright but not great
The problem with them however was just overall shoddy construction, the phones barely held together and ultimately the jack snapped off after less than two months of ownership after being dropped about a foot and a half onto carpet
This item had to have been defective
The remote only worked fine for two days after I received it
Then the headphones would activate voice control on its own, the songs would start skipping and all sorts of other things
I really don't think these are original Apple headphones
This earphone is definitely not genuine apple earphone
It's made in cheap cord and makes a loud noise when you talk to someone by this earphone
Think about it
Hi,  These head phones stink
I have never seen a product from Apple this bad
Are they even Apple; I don't think so
Don't buy these head phones
To be smart, spend the extra 15 bucks and buy it from Apple
com
WORKS WELLL, THE MIC WORKS AS IT SHOULD
ASWELL AS IT WAS SHIPPED TO ME FAST BECAUSE I LIVE IN NEWYORK ASWELL
I initially bought these because I really wanted a microphone for my iPod touch, and the remote seemed like an added bonus
However, they arrived with the remote split in half
It snapped back together fine, and I ignored it despite the fact that I had to tape it together (it still worked)
But within a few weeks, the cord cover ripped free of the plug, leaving exposed wiring
They continued to work fine, good audio quality, etc, until a month or so ago when the left earphone stopped working
Now I can only listen in the right ear or I have to stretch and bend the cord in odd angles to make the left earbud work
Definitely not worth the price
All I have to say is either they are a really bad knock-off or Apple has gotten cheap
the headphones not are original are a copy, runs good with my iPod touch 4g but im angry because I payed more for these earphones, a good copy but if you love the original things of apple only with 15 bucks more you can buy the original, yes I can recommend it
More Apple-esque than Apple, I suspect
One of the headphones crackles when the volume is loud
Knock-off earphones
Beware
I use these as in-ear monitors on stage while playing bass
The sound is great, the low end is very clear
I'm still working on the fit, but have only been using them for about a week
Very pleased so far
I assume the earphone is designed for professionals, who need to wear them for a long time
The design is not user-friendly at all if you want to take it off every now and then, because putting it on will take you a minute
You have to pull the string behind your ear EVERY SINGLE TIME
If you already have something hang up on your ear, your glasses, sun glasses or like me, simply like to put hair behind ear, it becomes very embarrassing, and I have to do all kinds of awkward action to put it on
The sound quality is OK, and remember, you have to keep high quality songs/player to empower it
I use them for biking and they produce a lot of wind noise
Sound is good when I'm stopped
These are my second pair of earbuds after years of relying on headphones
I bought them to replace my Klipsch X4i which developed a short circuit just a bit more than a year after I bought them (and, natch, just past the end of the warranty period)
Background:I am not an audiophile
I dislike heavy bass music
Indeed, I dislike loud music of any kind
I use earbuds/headphones primarily to listen to the radio and mp3 files while walking (of which I do a lot, in quiet neighborhoods and busy city centers)
I neither run nor do any other kind of exercise with them
That said:1
SOUND QUALITYI do notice a difference in sound quality between these and the Klipsch X4i
I think it is richer, but audio performance is so subjective, individuals have such different wishes, that's about all I can say
2
COMFORT/FITIt took me a couple of hours to figure out how to use my first earbuds (Klipsch X4i) and get comfortable taking them in and out
I spent probably close to 12 hours over several days trying to get the Shure to not only fit, but fit comfortably, and I still can't put them "on and off" as quickly or as easily as I can the Klipsch X4i
You can see from the image that these earbuds are both bigger than ordinary earbuds and shaped differently
I assume the engineers figured that the shape/size combination would help seal off outside noise more effectively by putting a bigger barrier in the outer ear
Unfortunately, I suspect that they must have tested the design on men with ears of a certain size
I have to tug and pull and twist all parts of my ear to try and get these to fit snugly
And when I got them to fit "properly" in my outer ear, the inner part, the part that extends into the ear canal with the eartips, never, ever quite get "in"
I could get the inside more or less plugged up only by letting the exterior body of the earbuds sort of stick outwards from my ear
These earbuds are, not unexpectedly, also heavier than my previous earbuds and not pleasantly so
I switched from headphones to earbuds precisely because I found the pressure of the former uncomfortable
On a short walk, this doesn't matter so much
At first, they are a bit uncomfortable
Then I get used to them
But on longer walks, the discomfort returns and I pretty much can't wait to get home and take them out
3
NOISE ISOLATIONWith the supplied eartips, noise isolation was close to zero
I tried them all
I even tried making my own out of standard earplugs (there's a lifehacker video showing how to do this: http://lifehacker
com/5347245/make-comfortable-noise-isolating-earbuds-for-less-than-a-dollar)
I did once, for a few minutes, manage to get a good seal in my left ear but I haven't been able to reproduce it
No doubt, with enough time and effort I might
Then I discovered "pluggerz - music" in a Walgreens (in the section with various kinds of earplugs)
These are the standard triple-flanged earplugs one can usually buy to block noise, but they are designed for use with earbuds
I've never liked this style much; I prefer the softer, rounded foam earplugs
$10 for two, but I was getting desperate
They were easy to attach to the Shure and almost immediately gave me incredible noise isolation
I still can't get the body of the earbud to fit snugly in my outer ear, but other than its probably looking peculiar, it doesn't affect the noise isolation
Others have mentioned the background "noise", the sound of the cables, while using these earbuds
With the supplied eartips, which provided almost no noise isolation, I didn't notice this
With the pluggerz, I do
In short, there seems to be a trade-off between hearing a certain amount of outside (traffic, etc
) noise but nothing else and hearing little or no outside noise but having this kind of hum/white noise/cable movement in the background
CONCLUSIONI plan to replace these with a more  conventional style of earbuds as soon as I can afford to do so
The pluggerz give me good noise isolation, and the audio is really quite good with the Shure, but they are simply way too uncomfortable for extended use - for me
First off, these sound decent
The clarity is what I would expect from a $100 pair of in ear headphones
The real reason I don't give it more stars is because I can't stand the 64" cable
I prefer working out with in-ear monitors and the cable is just way too long for me to put my phone in my pocket while I work out
I end up getting it caught on just about anything
I thought about upgrading the microphone/remote cable, but after seeing the horrible reviews on those, I'm thinking I'm just going to return these and get something else
No joke
These are quality headphones
My husband snores SO loud & these ear buds totally block him out
I also like my bass & I got it now
Shoulda bought these a long time ago had I known about them
Worth every penny
Sound great and fit nicely under a motorcycle helmet (if you are careful enough to get it on)
I've owned these for a year now and it beats the 15$ ones I used to get that kept breaking and sounded meh
I like to listen to music when I ride my motorcycle, especially on long trips
I went through many different earbuds from different manufacturers before buying these
I wish I would have found these first
The music fidelity is good, most of the wind noise gets blocked out and I can still hear surrounding noises to respond to traffic
I bought the replacement cable so I could adjust the volume or turn off the music
These take a little bit of figuring out the first time you put them on, but after that, you get to enjoy great sound quality and isolation
With the headphones in and no music, outside sounds are reduced, but not quite as much as you might expect
(I suspect the brain compensates and raises the apparent volume
) However, once you put music on even at a volume of 10% or so, that's all you will hear
And it will sound great
These are not bass heavy headphones, they have a balanced sound good for everything from pounding electronica to Irish traditional
Great sound and the tips are nice, I ordered some comfort tips for better fit
The fitment around the ears is great, stays in place when running, lifting weights, situps/laying down and doing jump rope
There seems to be no noise/rub on the wire and it is nice and thick
Not an issue so far and I've had it for quite some time now
I use it at the gym constantly
The 3
5mm tip is a bit on the clunky side if you have a nice thin MP3 player/phone you are using but not causing any issue just thought I'd mention it
These are excellent IEMs for the price, I don't have a large amount of experience with other in ear monitors but the sound through these is crisp and clear
The bass reproduction is pretty good, it's not too heavy at a neutral level without any enhancements but they can give a nice big clean amount of low end if you increase the low frequencies
One complaint I have is that the foam sleeves that come with the monitors are very difficult to remove, luckily they fit me fairly well so I haven't bothered with them too much
Also, I would recommend getting the black ones, it's very difficult to see the left and right letters on the clear ones which I bought
Overall though, a great product from Shure
Can wear the earbuds forever
Sit great in my ear
The multiple sleeve options make sure I get a good fit
Great sound
I keep looking at earbuds that cost ~$200 more and hten come back to this one because I can't justify the added expense
Cheap price for such amazing quality
I have Bose IE2 and the wire broke
Bose said I can purchase a new set at a discounted set for $70
I  no and I ended up with the Shure
Best decisions on in-ear headphones I made
They fit great and does not come loose a d they also sound amazing
The Sure has a more "life" feel to it then the Bose where it has a "flat" feel to it
I also use the Comply foam so sound isolation is really good
Better then the Bose IE2
I won't even compare them to Beats because its not even fair for Beats
Comparing Shure to Beats is like comparing a finely tuned supercar (Shure) to a turbocharged Civic (Beats)
The SE315 was another one I was looking at but I go though headphones quite easily just due to all the travel I do and the amount of usage I use them for, $200 was a bit much for me to  spend but the SE215 was in my budget and they are amazing
The fit does take a little getting used too but not too bad
These are the best in earphones I have ever tried with great sound quality
I have used them for music, watching movies and gaming
The sound is very clear with awesome bass
I have had mine for over a year and they still work like new
Great isolation
Great cord
Bass does bleed through the mids a bit
Use an amp with a
Eq and it can be cleaned up
But a well built set if iems with good low end
These are pretty nice
They took a little getting used-to, especially in how to put them on
After a week or so it becomes automatic
They really are sound-excluding, so don't walk or drive with these
You can't hear a d@mn thing besides your music
My wife hates them
Some may consider this a bonus
Music is clear and crisp
I was able to turn the volume WAY down, and still hear everything
In fact, I'd warn any buyer to be VERY sure the volume is turned way down first, before turning the music on
It will hurt like H3LL if you play at your normal earbud type volume and you just plug in and go
Trust me, I've done it several times
These are probably the best headphones I've ever tried
The experience reminds me of the first time I heard the headphones on a walkman years ago after years of AM radio
A new world
These headphones are the bomb I love them and use them for church
I use these as in-ear monitors on stage while playing bass
The sound is great, the low end is very clear
I'm still working on the fit, but have only been using them for about a week
Very pleased so far
just got these today so i am still exploring, but first impressions are GREAT
i've had a couple other sets of noise-isolating earphones before but these WAY outperform the others, both in noise-blocking and in sound quality
(most recently i had a klipsch set with comply foam tips for extra noise reduction
)the SE215s come with several different sizes of foam ear buds so you can find the perfect fit
bonus feature to that is the fact that the units swivel on the cable
so far, for me that means they seem much less likely to yank out of the ear
(used to happen to me a lot, hasn't once yet
)sound is crystal clear and balanced
(i use the 'bass booster' setting on my ipod, for whatever little bit that does
next i'll be adding an alpen DAC headphone amp once it arrives in the mail
) and i commute on the NYC subway, which is loud as hell from screeching turns/breaks and rattling metal to loud-talkers and generally large amounts of white noise
but today i listened to music i could NEVER enjoy before and the environment faded right out
in fact, there's enough reduction that i might advise people who'd be in danger if they couldn't hear something of their surroundings to get a different product
another nice feature is that the units are detachable so that if your cable bends/breaks, you don't have to throw out the whole set
just order a (cheap) new cable, swap, and off you go
this was a selling point for me, along with the strong reviews, as the last two sets i've had both went bad where the cable enters the earpiece
one feature that's not a negative, yet, but might get tedious: the cable is rather long, so from ears to unit-in-pocket there's a lot of slack
maybe enough to get annoying/caught on stuff or tangled
maybe not, we'll see
but it's definitely longer than the other sets i've had
for whatever that's worth
another possible drawback is that the cable is just the 'raw' wire with a very thin clear coating
this seems to increase the sound-in-ear of the cable rubbing on clothing, etc
(the klipsch come with a cable coated in special "no tangle' rubber that was a lot quieter against fabrics when the cable moved around
) so far this isn't a disaster--and the 'naked' style of the cable looks cool--but it proves to be the only negative i can find so far
certainly not enough to make me wish i'd chosen another product
These are a nice design, they are very harsh in the 6-8KHZ frequencies, limiting the volume
the bass is good, I'm not much of a 'Bass Head', but with these its not overpowering
To me, they are quite uncomfortable, i have small ears
So that may be a problem for just me
Worth a look, personal opinion
After using for a year, one of the wire sometimes not too often has the problem of connectivity (no sound on that side of course)
Though the wire is replaceable, it is pretty expensive like 40 dollars
Anyway, it is easy to carry with
I usually take it in my pocket
The small bag provided greatly reduced the possibility of wire messing up with itself
One problem is that in a cold winter day like here in Michigan, the wire becomes really stiff if you know what i mean
These are the perfect headphones
They have "memory wire" and so can fit snugly on your ear while you are jogging
They feature a replaceable cord (replacements are a bit expensive at like $30, but still, a very nice feature)
They sound great
They are perfect
I've used a number of earphones over the years
These sound better than the Etymotic MC5's to me
At least they are more tremendous while still giving good detail
And they fit better, have better ergonomics
The other are the Meelectronics M6 sport
Those are significantly more affordable, at around $20, but they don't sound nearly as good
Don't bother with other headphones, which fall out of your ears, have their cords get frayed, etc
Just buy one pair of these, and be set FOR LIFE
These are *amazing*
Listening to music at a comfortable volume, I can't myself snap my fingers
Total isolation
Love these things
I bought these mainly for traveling on airplanes and they work amazingly
The foam tips are great, easy to put in (Just like foam ear plugs) and they block a good bit of noise
Sound quality is pretty good as well
i am sure the're better sound quality headphones available, but for the price these things are great
Read other reviews about the poor cable quality
I've only had these for a month or so and don't use them everyday so I can't speak to the quality yet
I do plan on wrapping them to avoid issues just to be on the safe side
Definitely a good value
Great alternative to over the ear headphones
Decent bass response for the size and cost
Blocks outside noise as well as in ear noise protection
I ordered and tried several in ear phones based on "best" lists of professional online reviewers and Amazon reviews, trying to find the one that sounded best to me and had at least acceptable comfort
I ended up keeping these Shures along with the Beyerdynamic MMX 101 iE
The reason I kept the Shures is because of their warm, balanced sound
I can play these loud without any hint of harshness or listening fatigue
Played loud they sound quite punchy and have solid bass output
The midrange (vocals) is very smooth and accurate
Treble is very good, but could use a bit more extension
This is hard to do without adding harshness
I will always prefer a slightly rolled off treble over harshness
These are a bit of a pain to put into your ears, but once in, they are quite comfortable and provide a tight seal with excellent isolation from outside noise
The build quality is second to none in this price range
By comparison, the Beyerdynamics I mentioned earlier have more bass output, more accurate bass, not quite as good midrange, and similar treble
The Beyerdynamics also have a wider soundstage than the Shures, but much lower build quality
I love these, they're absolutely perfect for working musicians that need affordable in-ear monitors for performing
They're also perfect for working in noisy environs (like power plants or constrction) where you need hearing protection, but want music while you work
The sound quality is amazing
Rich bass, sweet mids, and tight highs, everything is reproduced perfectly
These are near reference quality, which is better than you'll need in any of the aforementioned situations
Buy these
DON'T BE STUPID
I listen to mostly rock, metal, blues etc and these are perfect
Once I found the right nubs that fit my ear
good effort
so amazing~~~
Amazing clarity despite being a little bulky and having a thick cord
As sound is the most important aspect in buying headphones to me, as well as noise cancellation for drumming, these are really top notch
i really love it
Great sound and truly noise cancelling
I did "break them in" by playing them for 24 hours at my normal volume a mix of music but I cant say I noticed a huge difference in sound quality
My only issue with them is that they are currently lost and I cant use them
Took a while to get used to, and to find the right ear bud
But when I did, wow
nice earphone
My choice for the motorcycle
Better then I even expected
Great
After my delightful and hardworking Shure SE315s finally decided to break after 6 years of pretty much daily use (replaced the cord 2 times), I needed to find a replacement earbuds
After reading a lot of reviews and contemplating, I realized I was not over my 315s
Once you've experienced amazing sound on a daily basis, going back to cheap earbuds is almost "painful"
However, the 315s were a little too pricey for me to replace at the moment, so I decided to go with the 215s
Checked a couple of other reviews and it seemed like there wasn't too much of a difference
Surprisingly the SE215s are a little more bass-y than my old 315s
The sound (to me) sounds pretty similar
Same high quality, heavy duty cord from shure, and as someone who used to go through many, many cheap <$10 earbuds, heavy duty cords are a godsend
The foam tips beautifully mold to my ears and it doesn't feel like anything at all
I love how they include many different sized tips (foam and rubber ones)
I don't have too much to say that already hasn't before, but if you're trying to decide between SE315 and SE215, the 215s are a great choice, not only because it's about $100 cheaper, but to a lay person who's not an expert audiophile, these are great
Loved these ear buds
The cord is really long but you get used to it
Very solid build
I love that I can replace the ear bud part of the headset that usually fails first
I love to foam ear pieces
I've read that the replacement cable is sub-par/in mic option which is a little scary as I might need to replace that part soon
Beats (gaga/diddy/lebrons) I've tried them all and they all failed in a years time
Finally gave up on them
The Shures SO MUCH BETTER
The sound quality is incomparable
Crisp high notes and the bass isn't lost either
No excess sound gets in
sound quality is amazing,  great headphones for the price
No es lo que esperaba en la calidad del sonido
Awesome sound
I have a bunch of earbuds but these are the best
Like these better than my Bowers & Wilkins C5 and my Klipsch S4's
Takes a little getting use to putting them on but worth it
Use the foam tips for best seal against ear canal and sound
Muy buen producto
Great comfort, but the wire gets pulled to the back after a while
Before I actually review this item I want to mention the seller "The Variety Spot" that I purchased from Amazon through
They are the BEST
I recently purchased a Rolls PM351 personal monitor and got the Mee Electronics headphones that appeared in the 'also purchased' section of the listing
Those headphones could not handle the sound, particularly the bass coming through the unit
I was in a tight spot because I wanted to use the personal monitor for some gigs coming up fast
Through research I found that the Shure PE215 headphones would probably be the best match since they are made for this application
I asked The Variety Spot if they could help me out by shipping ASAP and guess what
It was out the door within a couple of hours and with USPS 3 day priority mail
I received the unit in 3 days and am so happy to be using it  in time
The unit itself is solid
Shure sells some higher models that probably are better but for the price you will probably not find earbuds that can handle something like a stage monitor system as well
I play bass and sing some and so naturally I want those coming through
I  tried several headphones including the Mee Electronics, some Smoking Buds that I had lying around, some Sony earbuds and some Monster over the ear headphones that I have
None of them could handle the bass coming through the Rolls PM351
The Shure PE215 earbuds are sometimes slightly overdriven by the bass but other than that they do the trick very nicely
No surprise since they were made for this application
As a bonus they are the best headphones I have for listening to my music from my devices
Very balanced sound with the punchiest bass you will ever find
I believe that Shure also makes a model with a mic if you want to use it with your phone
For the price you will not beat these earbuds for stage or just listening to music
Thanks Variety Spot
I've had these for several years now, still going strong, no problems
Not a good purchase
They are very hard to place in the ears
I have bought Shure before and will not in the future
http://www
shure
com/americas/products/earphones-headphones/se-earphones they sell these on the actual wesite for 100
50% off my ass
Oh yeah and BTW WTF is SE215-K is that a way of saying if the product is not working correctly Shure is not responsible for it
I listen to mostly rock, metal, blues etc and these are perfect
Once I found the right nubs that fit my ear
the left one sometimes does not work well just about 10 days after I bought it
Good product I have been using it for the past three weeks and months flaws
They were a good buy, they sounded very good and so far nothing seems wrong with them
These are great
Good sound quality and the ear pieces provide good ambient sound insulation
Everything the description says
I use them everyday and the construct seems very durable
Its just a bit annoying trying to put them on because of the way the wire are coiled above your ears
I like nice sounding audio
These are incredible clear, clearest in-ear phones i have ever had
Only downside is the way in which they fit in your eat
Not exactly comfortable or easy to pop in and out
I like the technology and the looks, just not the comfort
I really like the earbuds,but the cables are terrible
tryed emailing the shipper but they never responded to my email
i guess i have no choice but to buy another cable at $25 which is terrible considering they may not last any longer than the first ones
i wish they would because they really help kill the noise and they also sound good and are comfortable
For $100 they should last longer than a month
I bought these to test them out with the in-ear monitor that we use in my band and I was extremely impressed with the sound quality
The sound field is extensive and very nicely balanced in the hi, mid & low frequencies
The bass is punchy and solid without overpowering the other frequencies which, as a drummer, is very important to me
The fit in and around the ear is excellent and provides excellent sound isolation so you hear what's in the ear monitor without being distracted by ambient sound
I let my bass player try them and he absolutely loved them
I also have a pair of Sony MDR7550 pro audio ear monitors which are awesome but, I'll tell you, for the price, you cannot beat these
They are very well designed and the detachable cord is a big plus
I will definitely be buying a few more sets of these
Shure really hit a home run with these bad boys
Excellent sound quality, really filters out noise
A little tough to getpositioned correctly in ear, but once in, they rock
Very good sound quality and isolation, tottaly recomended
Good
good
I hate it
Ordered Black, received USED clear headphones
Who would wear  used headphones
Simply not acceptable
Not for hard rock bands
6/9
great once you get the right tips for your ears, but the contact has issues
the music cutting out when you tilt your head a certain way sucks (irritates me on the treadmill)
Great sound quality for the price though
Great quality - use them under my helmet - should have bought them years ago
These were a great purchase for use as in ear monitors and daily headphones
The sound quality is amazingly crisp and clear and the bass is solid
It really depends on what music you listen to though (I prefer rock and the thumping lows of the kick drum sounds great along with bass guitar when turned up a bit, but it's not too bass heavy, very evenly distributed highs, mids, and lows)
I really enjoy the feature of the removable cord so you don't have to waste money on another pair if the cord frays or something
As for fitment, I like the extra earbuds included so you can get the feel you want
Also, the stiff but bendable end near the earbud sometimes loses it shape but it's nothing too big, I'm just being a bit critical
Sometimes it just needs to be messed with a bit to fit right
The fact that the cord is wrapped in Kevlar just adds to the durablity of the product, which I find is a nice touch
I'm not sure why anybody would spend $100 more to buy the SE425 when the SE215 has the whole package at a much better price
Overall 10/10 would buy againOne last note- while using these as daily headphones people thought they were hearing aids (I got the clear version)
The black version is a good choice too but I find that the clear is better if you want it to look discrete and semi invisible
I am a musician who enjoys recording, playing live, and listening to my favorite artists in a way that does their music justice
For in-ear headphones I use these
I can't wear these headphones for a very long time (all day), but the sound quality is very crisp and clear
I also like traveling with these
It blocks out a lot of noise and sit flush against my ears so that it doesn't hurt to lay my head down
I've seen some reviews where people have trouble hearing out of their headphones, and I would suggest doing what the company suggests
use the cleaning tool they provide and make sure the passage way is clear of dirt
For over the ear headphones I suggest Bose SoundTru over the ear headphones
They are incredibly comfortable and I can wear them all day if I wanted to
I don't have enough great things to say about these little things
All in all, I have tried ME Electronics dual driver earbuds, and the SE 215's beat them
I tried the Sennheiser HD 598, and SE 215s beat those too
And by clear margins, I had my roommates try and test the headphones with me too, just to get a more sound opinion, and not sound like I was crazy
For a little under a hundred dollars, you can transform your sound experience with these little IEMs
They pack a serious PUNCH
If you haven't tried them yet, you are really missing out
The sound isolation and the way it cups into your ear is very awesome too
They have a set of tips, you should test each of them to see which one keeps most snug in your ear
Once that is done, it really makes a huge difference
The outside world is completely shut out, and it's just you being transported into a different world
You'll hear sounds you never heard before
Seriously, amazing
I've had these 1 1/2 years now, mostly for jogging or gym work
They are great
Better bass than other earbuds I have tried
Takes awhile to get used to putting them in your ears, but the seal is tight and you block out a lot of external noise
So, these are also good on airline flights
My set once went into the washing machine for 15 minutes, in a shorts pocket, before I noticed
I let them dry out for 2 days, and they worked fine
About the only drawback is that they are like fishhooks, constantly snagging on everything
If I bundle them into a hand-full, it takes a minute to untangle them at the gym
Small price to pay for such good quality
I really want to like these headphones
Especially after spending an extra$50
00 for the iphone control cord
I've had them a couple of months, and listened with different ear buds with the same results
Muddled sound
No treble and not good base
The head phones that came with my I phone blow these away
I'm ready to throw them in the trash, but I'll use them now and then hoping they will sound better
No luck so far
For the price, I thought it was only okay
I needed a replacement after my Meelectronics A161P broke
A161P set a high standard for sound quality for me, so although this pair was great on certain points, it just did not meet my expectations
Pros- Excellent sound isolation - I wore these while commuting on the train, so that's a huge plus- Mids and highs were great- Cables were thick and gave the impression of sturdiness, and the ability to replace the cable is a nice thoughtCons:- Fussy, clunky and uncomfortable - People warned about this, true, but I still wanted to give it a shot
I've never had to adjust earbuds so much
They felt too big in my ears and would often stick out
Also, I had to adjust the cable over my ears too often
It's a deal breaker
- Not balanced - bass heavy
The bass level was too distracting for me
This was disappointing because many reviews hailed this pair as being "balanced"
Clearly, it's not
If you like extra bass, this would be a nice feature, but not for me
- Sitting unmoving was fine, but once I started walking, every move I made produced that "underwater" feeling
Also very distracting
I've had a few other noise isolation earbuds where this was a minor setback
- Cable was too long
When walking around it can get caught on stuff- Didn't care for the carry caseOver all, for how much it cost and the list of cons, I felt compelled to return this item
After this pair, I realized that I much prefer balanced armature earbuds like Meelectronics A161P
The only gripe I had about A161P was that the cables were flimsy and so the pair didn't even last a year
But the noise isolation was also excellent, and the "underwater" feeling was minimal compared to this pair
(If you love extra bass, you would probably not like the A161P
)So next I got Etymotic HF2 (similar price level), and I'm far happier with that because it has:- Balanced armature drivers and to me more sound balanced than these Shures (great mids, highs, and bass level was strong but not overpowering)- Excellent sound isolation- Not clunky and fit well in my ears- "Underwater" feeling was minimal- Cable length was just right and seems sturdy- Nice carry case
After breaking these bad boys in, I can say that I really like them
They have ample bass, and mids and highs that are just right
The foam eartips are airtight as well
I can't hear diddle with them in, which I like but some may not
It also includes silicone tips, which I would imagine would be a little less air tight, but I haven't tried them yet
The cable is solid and feels like it should endure the inevitable tugs and pulls that all cord will experience
And the cord is replaceable, which is nice because that was cause of all of my previous headphones kicking the bucket
For the price they are definitely worth it
Both the earphones which i purchased, came in  good packaging and the sound quality was awesome
Good amount of bass, music clarity was awesome & the isolation from external sounds is damn good, as the ear buds contours to your ear shape
Wires are good and thick
Suitable for both indoor and out door use too as the wire goes behind your ears and wont slip that easy
Good
Great ear buds
Worth every penny
Easy to use, perfect sound and isolating outside sound is a new world
I plug this to computer and guitar quality is top for the price Ill call it a ganga
These SE215 K Live are okay
For the sound quality I think they're a little over priced
If you stick any earbud deep enough in your ear they'll sound decent
I am a musician who enjoys recording, playing live, and listening to my favorite artists in a way that does their music justice
For in-ear headphones I use these
I can't wear these headphones for a very long time (all day), but the sound quality is very crisp and clear
I also like traveling with these
It blocks out a lot of noise and sit flush against my ears so that it doesn't hurt to lay my head down
I've seen some reviews where people have trouble hearing out of their headphones, and I would suggest doing what the company suggests
use the cleaning tool they provide and make sure the passage way is clear of dirt
For over the ear headphones I suggest Bose SoundTru over the ear headphones
They are incredibly comfortable and I can wear them all day if I wanted to
I have heard that these in ears were amazing, so I bought them
They sound amazing
I would buy them over and over again
These are easily the best headphones I've ever used
They meet my demands for music and it really brings out the details in lots of my songs
The sleeves do a great job of sealing in all the noise and keeping the ambient noise out
It also helps that they're very stylish (IMO)
Right side stopped working first 30 days
Love these, bought them because I lost my 4 year old predecessor pair
The audio quality is stunning, from lows to highs with little to no distortion
Very good at isolating sound passively, take a few days to get used to but I don't even notice the they wrap over my ears anymore
Sound quality is top class and I use these for audio recording work
These are great
But please note these are over-the-ear monitors, and don't seem to be designed for use like regular earbuds
If you do a lot of online video messaging and don't like earphone cables dangling as you speak, then these might be worth trying
I use them to monitor audio while video recording and keep them behind me
It's great in that application
A couple of subtle but solid points:  the case is a not soft case, and that makes a difference
Thank you Shure for giving me something protective to hold these when not in use
Plus, the multiple size and shapes of the sleeves is really a nice touch
Love it
Best in ear headphones ever
This is my second set; only bought new ones because first ones were stolen after 4 yrs of use
REPAIR PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, I never needed them after 6 yrs of total use though
Good bass
OK mid and his
Overall satisfied with the purchase
Bought these for my son
He uses them on stage and says they are superior to any of the other earphones he has tried
Sound so smooth
it's like being on stage or in the studio
Yes, this is a review of the Shure SE215 in-ear headphones, or in-ear monitors (IEM), but it's also a story of terrific customer service that's indicative of long-term thinking on the part of Shure
Before I dive into the Shure's, I'll give a bit of background of my musical preferences and what I'm looking for in headphones
I like clean natural sound
I typically avoid using equalizers and like my experience to be close to the natural sound of what's produced
I typically listen to classical, jazz, folk and pop, but my musical taste are fairly eclectic and across the board
Throw in a little R & B and dubstep over the top of Lindsay Sterling and you have it
So while I want to sense the thump in Bruno Mars' Grenade I want to hear clarity in Anne Akiko Meyer's playing of Vivaldi's Four Seasons
I hate bass emphasis especially if it results in muddy sound
I also want to note that I'm no audio expert, 80% of my listening is done on my smartphone (Nokia Lumia 920) and I probably spend as much or more time listening to audio books on the Audible app as I do listening to music
Most of my music is streamed from Beats Music service at 320 kbs or downloaded from Amazon at 256 kps vbr
If it's local, it's encoded either at 320 kps MP3 or vbr 320 kps WMA
All of this is to say, this is real world listening, mostly using my smartphone in a normal, active life
So while I'm serious about music, you could even say passionate, I'm not a hard-core audiophile who worries if his cables touch the carpet
For full review: wp
me/p2XCwQ-Zh
This is my 4th pair of SE sound canceling earphones
I have loved them all
My last was the 310
The ability to block outside noise has always been amazing, especially at a loud sporting event
I  got the 215Ks  a few days ago
I have never had a problem putting the earbuds in my ears, but, this was difficult
I had to watch a YouTube video over and over to try to get it right
I think I have it down now, and, the sound is great
They fit snugly once you figure it out
My biggest concern is that they don't block outside noise like all of the previous ones
The real test will be in a couple of weeks when I go to a sold out College football game with 96,000 screaming fans
If I can still block that out and listen to the radio at the same time, I might go up to 5 stars
I've used these earphones to practice with my band (I play bass) and have gigged with them several times
I've also used them on plane flights, and they cut ambient noise as well as high end over the ear phones
They only have one driver, so the bass response isn't great, but for the money I've been quite pleased
They come with several different sizes of rubber ear pieces, so one of them is likely to fit you
Sound quality is fantastic and they are very comfortable for me
Noise isolation is okay, but for me nowhere near as good as some other reviewers have experienced
If someone is talking while I have these earbuds in I can still hear them, though attenuation is moderately better than other earbuds
I've tried all 3 sizes of foam tips and, for me, small and medium are about the same in terms of noise isolation and the large are bad
I suppose my ears are just not the right size for these to be as effective as they could be
When I compare them to my Sennheiser HD280 headphones (not earbuds), they block about the same amount of sound and quality is about on par
When I put the Sennheisers on over the these SE215s I get real noise isolation
It's amazing, totally immersive, and really what I was hoping to get from the earbuds alone
These are very good earbuds but I would not have bought them if I'd have known that they wouldn't really be sound isolating for me
They sound fantastic
I am not a fan of the way they sit in my ears though
shure se215 sounds poor in high frequencies it's a bad point for this product
it has a not real sound
not recommended for listen real audios, monitoring mixes, not good for live sound, not good for mixing, only good for audio reference, no more
i wpuld like try another in ears
I am a sound engineer and I do not recommend this product
Honestly, it doesn't get much better than this when it comes to earbuds
Once I found the correct sized ear tip, these fit like a dream
I ended up choosing one of the memory foam cushion tips, which fit very much like earplugs, and these earbuds fit better than anything I've ever used before
I can honestly wear these for hours on end without complaint
An amazing fit, great sound, and a good value
Love these
good sound
isolates extremely well, I missed my station on the subway
uncomfortable to wear and get used to at first, but I got eventually got the hang of it
People stare at me funny as I loop it around my ears though
The clear one looks a lot prettier on screen than in real life
In person, it's a dull grey and looks unfinished and cheap and ugly and industrial looking
I might get klispch again just because it looks prettier
Good set of earphones
I was using them in a church band thru a monitor system
First time I used this kind of system and boy was it nice
Did have floor  monitors blaring us so we could hear our instruments
The tip that comes with it isn't the best at sound isolation, it was adequate
I bought some triple flange sleeve but I haven't figured out how to change the tips
I found instruction but I just feel like I'm going to break something
I'm sure I'll figure it out, but guess they won't fall out
Very good at blocking out sounds
Overall pleased with this product
FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The sound quality may be great, but I am having a tough time getting these things into my ears
I have had two pairs of Shure in-ear-monitors in the past and they were both designed to go up and over the ear but they do not have to be worn that way
I have long hair and I wear them without going up and over the back
I can't really do that with these, so I'm at a loss
And I cannot judge the sound against the previous models either
But I will say that I am smitten by the sound my previous Shure IEMs offer in general, and the sound isolation they provide
I will give these some more chances to wow me
It's hard for me to find earbuds that are comfortable for any extended period of time
These aren't perfect but they have great sound (clear highs and mids, and enough bass to support both) and are plenty comfortable while traveling around
I haven't taken them on a plane yet, but on buses/trains they do a great job of reducing outside noise
The sound is perfect but bass could have been made more richer
The downside of this headphone is just the design
The wire is too long and hard to manage
Other than that, everything is just perfect
I'll be waiting for a next iteration of this headphone
Finally
I found ear buds for my workout where I'm not adjusting them
These are perfect for the gym, I workout at least 5 days a week a majority of the time weight lifting so I'm always in different angles and these ear buds allow me to focus 100% on my workout/music as before I would have to mess with adjustment when I really start to sweat, no more
I highly recommend them to my gym rats out there
These headphones are amazing
So I read a lot of reviews both positive and negative before taking the plunge on these, and I'm really glad I did
It certainly helped with my initial experience - the truth is they really do take some getting used to putting them in
Past that the only caution I would give is if you wear glasses they feel a little awkward
Otherwise, they have immaculate  sound and are built very well
Great investment
These have a great, balanced sound with a surprising amount of detail and clarity considering they only have the one micro driver
Replaceable cable is sure to add to the lifetime of these
Also the cable itself is of the highest quality I've ever seen
Noticeable micro vibrations are a thing of the past with these
And there going to take a real beating to cause damage to them
The case is alright but it's not really going to protect the buds if you sit/step on it or anything
It's purpose is mostly to make it more convenient to transport them, witch it performs admirably
You can order a harder case that comes with the more expensive versions if your worried about it (there fairly cheap to) but it's not really an issue for the way I'll be using them
And now for my one issue with these
Removing the tips
This isn't something you'll do often once you found your size thankfully but when I first got them I obviously wanted to try them all to get the best seal/fit
These suckers are hard to get off, the foam ones in particular because you have to use so much pressure it feels like your going to tear the foam
Fortunately the foam was more resilient then I anticipated and they regained there shape without any noticeable damage
My other concern was that the tip they slide on to is plastic
You can tell its a thicker good quality plastic but with the way it sticks out combined with the pressure needed to swap tips I was sure that it was going to crack
Maybe I'm just a little to paranoid and I understand they don't want the tips sliding at all but the tightness applied here seems a bit excessive to me
In closing I'd say Sure just made themselves a new fan and in the future I'll be looking to get some 535's
If they can get this great a sound with one simple micro driver I can only imagine what 3 hi-def drivers with a passive crossover sounds like
very well made and sound pretty good
they're just OK
Best in-ear headphones I have owned yet
Amazing sound, very stable in your ears (especially for jogging), and completely isolates your sound as well as a non-noise cancelling headphone can do
I have had mine for two years before I needed to get them replaced, but it is mainly due to my usage and less to do with the product
Over time, if you use these for running, sweat can cause corrosion in the connector from the cord to the monitors
I plan on buying another pair of these strictly for office/home/travel use and a seperate one for running, otherwise I believe these would have lasted much much longer
Excelent
For the money, you cannot ask for anything better
I have an older version of these headphones (SE110) and the clarity you get with these newer drivers is much better
Some may not like the over-the-ear design
This is a personal preference but once inserted, they stay in place without any discomfort
Plus, the passive noise reduction is great for the traveler who flies long distance
I am able to save my hearing but using these during the flight to reduce the cabin noise
I have had these headphones for about a week, and they seem sturdy, and feel fine in my ear
However, the sound is very fuzzy
Bottom line is you've got to spend quite a bit of money to get a pair of earbuds with significantly better sound quality than these, and then you'll also have to buy a dedicated amplifier to really get the most out of them so, this is just about as good as it gets in these price range
This little wonder from Shure deliver poweful bass and rich, creamy mids that will put to shame many other similarly (or higher) priced options
The highs could be a tad better, but then again you'd have to spend more in a multi-driver model to get top quality in every range, IMHO
For those who are considering buying a pair of "real" earphones for their portable music devices, let me tell you, go for it
You won't be dissapointed, you guys just don't know how good your iPhone/iPod, Galaxy, or whatever device you use really is until you've tested it with a pair of decent ear pieces instead of the lousy ones that come included with them
Great sound, great noise isolation, long lasting
I am torn about whether to reduce them by 1 star for price/value, but I got a previous pair replaced by Shure without discussion after long time use, so will stay with 5 stars
Sound is great but the problem is the cables are too stiff, sure I can replace them but that's an addition cost
It's difficult keeping them in place, keep falling off
Gonna keep looking for the right pair that sound good and will stay in place
I want to hear music not spend my time keeping them in place
The sound quality in this headphones is (Ok) i don't like the bass at all it makes them sound a little muffled
And the peace�of plastic that goes around your ear it's uncomfortable
The stock cord is abysmal
Buy one without the wire guided cords and inline controls for $15 on ebay
Sound quality is excellent for everyday listening
I think that they give me the most I could possible get out of my music streaming services (about 300kbps)
However if I were to invest in a DAC I don't think that they would improve by much
Also the sound isolation is ridiculous
Could easily take out the cords and use them as earplugs
I've been using Shure earphones for a decade and these are the best so far
They make a very tight seal in the ear to block out noise and the sound quality is excellent
Bought this ear phone a year ago and used it during travel and workout
The left speaker stopped working after a year
Sound quality was good and was comfortable to wear
Disappointed with the quality that it did not lasting longer
The left headphone cable started cutting in and out when moved after the first week of owning them
They have a 2 year warranty, but require me to send the cable back first before they will issue a replacement
I fly 2+ times a week and like to use these on my flights and don't really want to have any downtime without them
Bummed
For such a big company you'd think that they had an advanced ship warranty solution with a credit card hold so I could continue "using" them until the cable arrived
Also Shure does not cover the shipping of the cable back to them for warranty
figure it out Shure
this is my second pair of these headphones
they are the best in-eat I've ever used
they have great sound isolation
I use them while running a chain saw and they are Great War protection
I also use them to work out and they stay in no matter what you are doing
very comfortable to wear
Most of what you hear about these buds is true
They are excellent with all around great sound
A little rolled off at the highs but beautifully warm with big sound
I've had the previous version prior to this and there is a big improvement to the sounds quality
Great choice for the average to discriminating listener
The earbuds alone aren't design for sport since they were design originally for musicians and/or more valued music listeners
The earbuds are very nice and allow different earbuds for different ear sizes
The earbud may not look nice when wearing in the eyes of many people, but the quality is beautiful for this price
It has managed to overtake the most distorted guitar screeches, to the most deep bass drops and tempos from my playist and sound like if I was there helping produce it
My first pair got damaged since it used for working out, (NOTE NOT INTENDED FOR SPORTS AT ALL
Earbuds not designed for that
) but Shure has a amazing customer service alone I would give 5/5
SInce they gave me a new replacement no problem
I highly recommend these as they are durable and sleek in design with the most beautiful sound quality 100$ could get you for these
You won't regret it
(FINAL NOTE: THIS DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN JUST STUFF THEM IN YOUR POCKET AND EXPECT THEM TO BE OKAY
THEY INCLUDE A CARRYING CASE FOR A REASON WHICH FITS NICELY IN YOUR POCKETS
THIS WILL BE A HUGE WAY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR EARPHONES
LET ALONE THE EARWAX REMOVER FOR THE EARBUDS AND TUBE FOR THE MONITORS
)Tldr: BUY IT BUT NOT INTENDED FOR SPORTS AT ALL
QUALITY IS BEAUTIFUL, AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALONE IS 5/5
HIGHLY RECCOMMEND
I use these when I play drums live
After two months of use, the right side started to give disconnect sound when I move sometimes
Not a big deal yet , but it's not as sturdy as I thought
And I keep it/use it very carefully, and don't even move that much
Perfect But: The cable broke after few months of use
and replacement parts are expensive
These fit under my motorcycle helmet and stay in place well
Excellent choice if you are looking for good bang/buck ratio
Structure allows bigger capsule enabling sound quality that beats any small-format plugs hands down
Foam plugs offer excellent background noise insulation for motorcycle use and profile is low enough so that these will sit comfortably even under full face helmet
Cables break in surprisingly fast to fit around your ears
Guys i bought this product and frankly speaking i swear the sound quality is so badddddd dam i regret so much for paying for this
The Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone sound way more better than this
i mean it and its way more better in every aspects except that its not for sports and the earbuds fall off easily
The bass in se215  is so so soooo flat i really hate this product :@ and the sound is very flat too the stock Samsung earphones is sexy compared to this s***
when is comes to isolation bull s*** isolation i can hear people talking next to me when the volume is at center and ofcourse when the volume is louder i couldn't hear any of those(dam that hurts too)
The looks is sooo f&&&in bad its not as it looks over the pick its kinda yellowish
The only pro i find is that the design is good to listen to music when you are sleeping and it never falls of the ear no matter what
I'm use to using the 425s provided to me on stage with an Aviom, which works well together
I already purchased my own memory foam ear tips to avoid stranger danger in the earwax department
Since they are all breaking through heavy use though, it was time for me to get my own pair to have in case needed
I totally was taken aback when I plugged this personal pair into a device at home without all the adjustable levels on the Aviom
I mean, my SkullCandy $30 set has a more tolerable balance by far
I have sensitive ear canals, so I'm wondering the process of trying out a gazillion ear tips, including the extra order of the 3-tiered white silicone ones, has caused my perception to be irritated in general
I would almost classify it as an overstimulated sensation
The Shure's are truly louder than the cheeper sets I have, not limited to the above mentioned
I guess you could say they are really fuller in retrospect
I think maybe I need to get used to this to appreciate it, and I'm just overwhelmed with sorting the sounds right now
There is no difference in balance between the los, mids, and his for me at this point
They're all there, but they blend to an almost unison level
Can you say "mono
"One thing I did learn is that the ear tips make a HUGE difference on anything past the mids getting through
I'm finding the best sound, and honestly comfort, with the memory foam ear pieces
Nothing is beating the memory foam with these for balance
The positive for me is the way I can receive the vocals in my ear in spite of a very loud environment
Sitting here at home, nothing more than the UPS man delivery making my dog bark and my refrigerator humming, really shows me these are more of my stage ears, not so much my recreational choice
Maybe my ears will become more seasoned over time, maybe not
Excellent well balanced earphones
I use them in a small rehearsal studio where live drums are played and work great
Sound can only be heard through the earphones so levels can be maintained low
I ordered these little guys used with new tips on them for $85 including shipping from here
I was pretty hesitant spending that much on a set of earbuds but since my band is trying to set up a custom motioning system and these were the cheapest we could find with the best reviews, we all ended up going for the SE215's
I was blown away by the quality first off, I could hear things that my set of $150 mixing headphones wouldn't pick up on
And they actually stay in my ears
I haven't even felt them close to falling out yet
Apart from using these with my band, I also have been taking them to work (I work in a metal machine shop) and I gotta say the sound isolation on these are insane
I can barely even hear the machines, quiet sections of songs still ring right through and even reverb is audible
They are also very comfortable with the right ear-insert
They do take a bit of getting used to because of the over-ear design but honestly they have become more comfortable than any other earbud I've used
I still don't know if they are worth $100 but I'm definitely not, by any means, kicking myself for buying these
Excellent sound quality
Noticeably better than other earphones I own (about $20 price range) even with low quality sources like my laptop or my cell phone
However, the procedure to insert the earphones in your ear in the correct position is a bit complex, time consuming and awkward
They are great earphones, I just couldn't get used to the behind the ear types
I was paranoid that it would fall out
Love them Great
Awesome head phones
Relatively happy, much better than Sennheiser CX 685 which had worse quality sound
Still this is no match to my Denon AHD1001S, in terms of depth of sound and fidelity, but still pretty decent sound across different music styles
I use them for running, and they stay quite fit for the first 30 minutes, but then start to slide when get sweaty, so need to keep readjusting
Overall good value
I don't have enough great things to say about these little things
All in all, I have tried ME Electronics dual driver earbuds, and the SE 215's beat them
I tried the Sennheiser HD 598, and SE 215s beat those too
And by clear margins, I had my roommates try and test the headphones with me too, just to get a more sound opinion, and not sound like I was crazy
For a little under a hundred dollars, you can transform your sound experience with these little IEMs
They pack a serious PUNCH
If you haven't tried them yet, you are really missing out
The sound isolation and the way it cups into your ear is very awesome too
They have a set of tips, you should test each of them to see which one keeps most snug in your ear
Once that is done, it really makes a huge difference
The outside world is completely shut out, and it's just you being transported into a different world
You'll hear sounds you never heard before
Seriously, amazing
Left side just stopped working about a month ago
Never had any spills or impact damage
Daily use at the gym, but that's all
Would have hoped that something like this would last for more than a year
Guess not
I purchased these IEM's and after reading lots of reviews I wanted to state the following: all earbuds with dynamic drivers need some break in time, please believe this
If you think that they will sound the same right out of the box, as opposed to after you listen to them for many hours, you are wrong in that assumption
I own several pairs  and purchased these for their boost in bass response over the less expensive Shure model
I listened to them out of the box and then after every ten hours of break in
You can use white noise CD's or the like but here's what has worked for me breaking in 4 to 5 pairs in the past 6 months
Get yourself an adapter plug and plug your IEM's into your receiver or your boombox or your radio
Put them on and raise the sound level to where they are comfortable then take them off and crank it up to where you can hear them while you're holding them in your hand
Play talk radio for 10 hours, rock music for 10 hours, classical music for 10 hours and after every 10 hour session listen to the IEM's
The difference with the SE215's after 30 hours was striking, no sibilance, the midrange and the lows were so much clearer and deeper
After another 30 hours I can honestly say that for 100 bucks these buds are definitely worth it
Now having said that, I also have to state that a pair of Monster N-Lites that I paid 60 bucks for after 20 hours of break in sounded almost as good as the Shure SE215-K's I purchased
What's my point
There are a lot of really good earbuds in the 50 to 100 dollar range
the Shures are excellent and I use them  at home for their superior bass and I use the N-Lites for the gym and running
I own and highly recommend the RHA-MA750's, the HiFiMan's for 99 bucks, the Klipsh Image S-4's and the Monster Turbos that I paid 100 bucks for
I am a bit of a fanatic when it comes to my music and just like speakers I find that headphones and IEM's all seem to have sonic signatures all their own
The SE215's are a superior product, with a 2 year warranty, replaceable cords and once broken in, sound quality above the purchase price
When I listen to my laptop through my Dragonfly DAC and the Shure SE215's I am one happy camper
Folks, I can be more technical and try to impress you with terms that make me sound like the audiophile I am but what's the point of that
These are for 100 dollars worth every cent
After break in I had to turn the volume down even lower and was amazed at how well these IEM's performed and gave that sense of being outside of my head
Audio is very subjective, what one person hears another may not, that's why I listen through differing pairs
That and the fact that I'm a bit maniacal about my music
When I am ready to spend more on IEM's the 315's or 415's will be the ones I buy from Shure and I must add, Amazon's service is beyond belief
I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I reiterate, break them in for sonic bliss, a minimum of 40 hours before critical listening
Amazing sound very good quality and good fit for my ears
I have had several other earbuds
Love the depth of the bass
So far so good
Aweeessssooommmeeee
I really like the sound from these in-ear headphones, though I will say the bass could be sharper
I also couldn't change earpieces based on the instructions provided
Some more descriptive tips on how to seat these in the ear properly would also have been appreciated
They sit in your ear kind of like a hearing aid, with the cord running vertically up the front of the ear, then looping behind the ear and back down
It takes me a while to get them seated properly, though I hope I'll get better at it in time
Once I do get them properly in place, the cords that should wrap neatly around my ear end up sticking too far up and out, looking ridiculous and feeling a bit awkward
All that said, I still give them four stars because, for in-hear headphones, these to sound pretty darned good
Great sounding
Other reviewers thought that they were hard to get used to at first but I found that they fit my ears perfectly
PROS: Sound quality is solid for tiny earphones at this price point
Highs are clear
Lows are good enough
More importantly, they protect my ears
I can drum along to any track with the music at a safe volume and still hear my drums through the mix
It also comes with a nice carrying case, and they look pretty cool
I feel like a Backstreet Boy with these guys in my ears
CONS: It is really pretty hard to change the earbud sizes though
The first time I finally managed to pull one off I thought I had broken the stem
Be careful taking them off, but you will also need a lot of force to do so
Don't put them in the fridge, like others have suggested
Now to test their longevity
These headphones are pretty good
The sound quality for the prices is about what I was expecting
The foam pieces that come installed on them are not that comfortable but the earbuds come with multiple tips that you can switch out to
The tips that are on it are very hard to get off
I found that one of the tips felt good in the ear but form a seal completely inside your ear and can lead to some ear pressure issues (i have sensitive ears)
I bought these as a replacement to a busted pair of Klipsch S4's
Sound quality overall is better than my S4's were
Highs are crystal clear without any harshness
Mid and low frequencies come in very clear as well, but I feel these lack the bass response of the Klipsch
Not a massive difference, but something to consider
If you like a lot of booming bass you'd probably be better served with Beats headphones
I am really enjoying the sound quality and clarity though
I'm hearing things that I never heard before in my music which is quite fun
I do wish they had more bottom end response though, maybe I'll play with the equalizer on my device to see if I can make up for it
These took a bit to get used to the fit
I looked like a goof for the first 10 minutes trying to figure out how to put them in, but after a few tries you get better at it
Once they're in they are very secure
Outside noises are virtually eliminated, as the contact points are made of a material similar to a really good pair of ear plugs
That's a huge plus for me, as I was looking for something to make noisy flights more bearable
There are multiple sizes included to fit any ear
That said, the driver itself is rather large
I have "Colbert ears" where one sticks out and the other is more flat
My flatter ear ends up hurting a bit from the driver pressing on it
No problem with my stick-out ear
Kind of hard to explain, and your results may vary
Last note about the fit is that these have to be put in a certain way, meaning that it does take a bit of your concentration to install them
You can't just walk out of a coffee shop with your cappuccino in hand while installing them with your other
Another great thing about these headphones is the cable which is replaceable and rather thick
I've destroyed a number of headphones from frayed or damaged cables, and I feel these won't be susceptible to that same damage
Also, the cable seems to be shielded
Meaning when you're walking you don't get ANY noise interference from cable movement or the cable knocking against things (your body, your arm, etc)
The Klipsch were HORRIBLE with this
Overall I think they're good and I'd recommend them over the Klipsch S4
Sure they look a bit strange and require more effort to put in your ear
But they are much clearer, better built, and have much better sound isolation
Minus one star for the strange fit and slight lack of low end
i switched to the SE215s after years of V-Moda buds
what stands out: sound isolation and bass response (both are incredible)what doesn't stand out: mids and highs (par for the course)what disappointed: just about nothingbottom line: very good IEMs for their price, I highly recommend them over any V-moda buds
There's a lot of good things about this product
I don't even know where to start
The cables are thick and firm (more so than normal earphones
Some might not like how it retains a little of it's shape), and extremely well reinforced
You know all those places where you break your cable at
Well not anymore
Also, not many how much they move around, there's no vibrations to be heard
That's something not too many earphones can be proud of
Detachable cables
I didn't even know about this when I bought it
Basically, you can detach the actual earphone pieces from the cable for replacement (the cable that is)
It just pops right out, but only if you want it to: it has a good mechanism to keep it in place
Clear headphones
I normally don't care about the color (unless it's pink) but making it see-through was a great idea
I like to see the cables inside of it
A lot of people have trouble actually putting these things on
Even I had trouble with it at first (even though I already had one pair of shures before)
They're only cables, but they're also over-the-ear models
Most Shures are I think
They wrap around the top of your ear and slide down to fit comfortably into your ear
It's comfortable, but some might not like how it does that
Don't even try and put them in like conventional headphones
It won't work
You get two types of earpieces: a soft malleable type, and a hard plastic type
The soft type is great to block out a lot of exterior noise, but it gets dirty real quick
It's kind of nasty if you plan on sharing your earphones with others
The hard type doesn't get dirty whatsoever, but the quality drops, meaning you can hear the outside
This product is absolutely amazing
And for half of the price it's a damn steal
Not to mention you also get a year of warranty included
I recommend this product 100%, and I applaud Shure for getting it right
The sound is great and the design comfortable
Unfortunately the Left earbud failed after 30 days and its replacement from shure failed after a week
This earbud has a major design flaw
Do not buy until it has been corrected
Just got these earbuds last week
I am a weekend musician and planned on using them for both in-ear monitoring on stage, and mp3 player use on airplanes, etc
After one use in each application, I am very happy with the sound, and VERY unhappy with the fact that every time the cord moves, sound cuts out to one of the earbuds
Where the removable cord attaches to the earbud, there is a design flaw that permits cutting out
Trust me, nothing is more frustrating than being on stage and having to stand still like a robot in order to be able to hear out of both sides of these earbuds
I returned them immediately, and am very disappointed in Shure
This should not be happening on the scale that it is
Google search SE215 problems and you will see what I mean
VERY DISAPPOINTING
Bought these se215 headphones to replace 6 year old E3 where the phono jack was worn from plugging in so much
Got them in April and use them 8-10 hours a week
The left earphone started cutting out and I would have to jiggle the rotating connection on the earphone
That would work for a minute or two then became more frequent and completely cut out
Now it is dead
Tried cleaning the connection and switching connections left-right right-left still no luck
The pivoting connection is horrible and moving connections are destined for failure
I will stick with a fixed connection next time
They do have more bass than the E3's but the E3's have more robust cables and connectors
I've been purchasing shure earbuds for 4+ years
A common problem among the last three I possessed is that around the 1-2 yr mark the wiring right where the chord connects to the earbud would start to fray
I'm a stubborn individual and have been convinced that despite this enraging flaw, the sound quality and design of the earbuds left most others in the dust
Fast forward to this month
I just bought this model, and was excited by the prospect of the chord plugging into the earbuds, avoiding chord wear and tear
Then the left side goes dead during the 1st test run
I'm going for a replacement opposed to refund in the hope that this was a lemon
But if anyone has recommendations for reasonably priced earbuds with good sound, nice fit, and DURABILITY, please comment on this rating
I'm open to suggestions if the replacement earbuds crap out on me
The sound on these are great except for the highs as bass overpowers
Left earphone stopped working within a week :( had to return
I can't say enough about these earphones
I am a drummer that made the switch to in-ear monitoring about six months ago and have never looked back
Starting with cheap earbuds and then moving up to a pair of Klipsch S4 earbuds, I have been looking at these for awhile and finally decided to try them out because of the list of nice features they offer for the price
I wish I would have started out with these
My Klipsch's sounded very good but these blow them away
The bass is unbelievable and the clarity and mix of highs, mids, and lows is perfect IMO
These Shures are so comfortable that I actually forget that I have them in
The way they sit in your ear and the cord comes out the front and goes over the top of the ear makes them look very professional
The replaceable cord is also a huge plus
These are simply great earbuds for either general music listening or an entry level IEM system
I am currently using these with a Behringer 802 mixer, for monitor feeds, and I couldn't be happier
Stop looking and buy these now if you've been thinking about it
MY OPINION:Durability of the spliced ends:  I get a new pair of earbuds pretty much every year because the wires (where they attach into the earbuds) eventually get worn and break
I'm a 44 year old woman and wear them for running or while on the elliptical (so general wear and tear)
Being that I have professionally done the same type of splices that where done on these "refurbished" earbuds, I know that these splices cannot withstand (for very long) the movement that they will be subjected to if one uses them when exercising
I would never recommend that splice with a wire that will be moving around very much
Cost of this refurbishment:  I had already spliced my old pair (at home--for free), with a much more reliable splice job (so I guess I'll keep using my old ones until I order NEW ones)
I'm curious as to how the seller feels he/she rates to charge $99 for this repair splice, that takes about 5 mins
I really have to question the ethics of that
Next issue with these earbuds:  I have a pair of the old Shure 215's, which I purchased about a year ago, only mine are better because they have a part that can be used with a cell phone
I may have missed that feature in these refurbished ones, but I would expect the newer version to have, at a minimum, the same features--not less
My last issue is that now I'm being charged to ship them back because I'm not willing to settle for the quality of this product
And I also paid to ship them to me
I feel like I got jacked since the earbuds are junk--in my opinion
By the way, the replacement ends (when you need to change them out), I think I saw somewhere that they cost $40 by themselves
For that amount, you've spent about half the amount of the original cost of the refurbished ones
I have owned these earphones for about a month now
I don't know if I would consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy my music when it sounds good
When my old pair of Sony earbuds fell apart, I decided it was time to step up to an entirely new level of earbud sophistication
After some research, I decided on the Shure SE215, which had received many favorable reviews
Plus, at roughly $100, the price was reasonable compared to other kinds of headphones out on the market
Ultimately, the Shure SE215s are the best sounding in-ear headphones I have ever heard
There were, however, a few initial problems with these earphones
This next portion of the review is going to sound overwhelmingly negative, but bear with me
The first problem I had with these earphones came down to comfort
For the first week or two of ownership, the SE215 is a difficult headphone to wear comfortably, and finding an easy way to wear them is a long and awkward process
The SE215 is shaped quite differently than any other earphone I have owned, and therefore resulted in some unique kinds of ear pain and fatigue from even the briefest periods of use
The cable on the SE215 is designed to curve up and over the ear, which was once again completely different from any other earphone I have used
Problem is, the cable is quite rigid and will not curve around the ear easily
In fact, it took me a good three hours before I had found a way to keep the earphones in my ears without the cable falling off and bumping into my cheek, which was annoying
Then, after I found a way to keep the earphones in my ears, the next issue presented itself
They sounded terrible, alternating between a slightly "tinny" sound with no bass and having the right earphone muted in comparison to the left earphone
This was confusing, because the SE215 was supposedly the best sounding earphone in the world for the price
Now, any sane person would be asking themselves why I gave these earphones a perfect 5/5 if I had such a rough time with them
Rest assured, there is a light at the end of this tunnel
Allow me to explain
The ear pain and fatigue is common with any new kind of earphone
As mentioned before, I have owned Sony earphones over the years
I remember each one of those headphones bothering my ears for the first few weeks of ownership
Eventually, your ears just get used to the new earphones, which leads to lessened pain and fatigue
After a month or so of regularly listening to them, the SE215 no longer fatigues my ears
They are actually rather comfortable
The cable has also limbered up a bit, making it easier to fold up and around my ears than before
But the biggest improvements have to be attributed to the foam "sleeves" included with the SE215
These headphones come out of the box with six pairs of interchangeable "sleeves," which are the parts of the earphone you insert into your ear
Three pairs are rubber, and three pairs are made of a fragile foam
Having no experience with foam sleeves, I immediately attempted the rubber sleeves
I am not too sure why these earphones come with rubber sleeves, because they are largely useless
The rubber sleeves refused to stay in my ears and made the earphones sound awful
So I moved on to the foam sleeves, which were a revelation
Not only are they very comfortable, but the foam sleeve really allow the Shure SE215s to work their magic
In order to work properly, the instructions state that the earphones must have a good seal against the outside world
The foam sleeves provide that seal, leading to a sound experience that rivals even the audiophile-spec Sennheiser HD 595s I use for serious stereo listening
The foam sleeves are fragile, though, so handle and replace them with care
The Shure SE215 really is a fine piece of audio equipment
They sound phenomenal, easily matching much more expensive headphones and outclassing everything I have tried up to this point in my life
There are some initial problems, but these problems will either go away over time or can be erased entirely by using the foam sleeves
I would not use them for exercise, but that's what a cheap pair of earbuds are for
I highly recommend the Shure SE215 to anyone wanting an amazing earphone
I'm not an audiophile to the point where I have spent thousands on amps and headphones, but I do have an ear for music
These Shure earphones are not only an upgrade in physical quality but sound and quality as well
Comparing these to the previous generation, the bass has been much improved
As I've read in other reviews the highs do somewhat lack but for $100 high end earphones, you can't expect the very best
I mainly use these as a personal monitor when I play the drums and immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality than my previous set
I was able to hear my bass very clearly and my drums simply sounded much better just by listening to them through my earphones
They fit so naturally and comfortably in my ear they truly are no bother at all
The malleable first couple of inches is great for preventing the cable moving around too much
The removable cable has not caused any sort of issues and I just hope it stays that way
Shure has always made great quality products so I doubt it will be an issue
If you truly care about the music you listen to, dump those silly Skull Candy earphones and pick up a pair of a real earphones
This is not the first set of Shure earbuds I've owned
I had a set of the E2c's, which were fantastic
After about 5 years of hard labor, they finally gave up the ghost, and suffered the usual death by cable rot to which that series of buds were so prone
So I took to the search for a replacement, and these were my criteria
1
They must be in-ear style buds, with the option to switch the sleeves (The piece that goes in the ear)
Also, they must include those swappable pieces
2
They must have a good warranty of at least 2 years
3
They must not cost more than ~100 USD
4
They must sound great
(These are in no order of preference, and all considered equal)So with that in mind, I also need to mention that I was partial to Shure
Mostly, because the E2c's were my first real good set of earphones, and broke down all my stigmas as to "Why would anyone pay so much for headphones
"  So here is my review
The Sleeves - There are 2 different types of sleeves bundled with this set; one a flexible rubber, the other a re-expandable foam
Each has three separate sizes, to help you find a good fit
I tried both
The foam sleeves feel nice, so long as you insert them like earplugs
They expand nicely to your ear canal
They offer fantastic sound isolation, and stay inside
The rubber sleeves are comfortable, but they are constantly being pulled out of your ears by the very stiff cord
I will try them again once I get the cord broken in a bit more, but for now, I'm going with the foam sleeves
The Warranty - 2 years, not bad, but my E2c's had 3
From what I hear, the cable rot issue is still going on, but I will expand on that in a minute
The cost - If you can get them for 100 USD, then do it
I think they are normally 2X that price
The Sound - At first, I was a bit worried
I was hearing some odd pops in the earphones
Pops that I shouldn't be hearing from a headset this expensive
But, that turned out to be from the player I had them plugged into
I tried a different source, and no pops
They are at least as good as my E2c's were when I first got them
There is some talk about the lows and highs and all that, and I don't know about all that
I know that I was getting some weird looks at the restaurant I was at when I was headbanging and booth-breaking (sit down dancing at my table) to the music
I listen to a lot of rock, electronica, and trip hop, and it all sounds great
Other Stuff - I mentioned the cables, and for good reason
Shure has a history of cable rot; the insulation on the wires literally rots off, and results in dead headphones
To combat that, they have added 2 features
One, an additional layer of insulation around where the wire goes over the ear (The most common place of rot)
This likely extends the life of the cable, which makes it even thicker than it already is, which makes it VERY stiff
This stiffness leads to the cable not staying in place, and needing some serious breaking in, which in turn could lead to breaking the wire
So be careful, and be patient
If you use the foam sleeves, then it isn't that big of a problem
The other thing is that they made the cable able to be detached from the earpiece, which means you can replace it if it goes bad
This is nice, except that, it's proprietary
It is unlikely that Shure will still have these cables in a few years available for purchase or otherwise
So while it's a nice feature, you likely won't be able to use it for anything other than changing the color of your wires
(It would likely be a good idea to order a spare once these earbuds are discontinued)
I also want to comment on the case that comes with the set
It is pretty crappy
It looks ok, but it lacks anything to wrap the cord around
You have to wind it up on your own, then stuff it in
It's also a soft case
The E2c's had a fairly solid case with a plastic piece inside to wrap around, and with a spot in the center of that to house the drivers
I don't know what gives on this, but come on Shure, you went backwards on this part
(Minor yes, but still, why go backwards
)So that's my experience with the 215's
I recommend them to anyone that knows how important a good set of headphones are, but doesn't have a lot of money to dedicate to them
I hesitated to splurge on these since I have the Shure SE 115 m+ for my iphone, which I was already very happy with
However, it was worth it
These are much more comfortable, although more difficult to put in your ears right (maybe taking 10 seconds instead of 2)
Over time, they are more comfortable to wear than the Shure SE 115m+ and they sound better to me too
They also isolate better, whereas with the SE115, I have to put them really deeply in my ears to get good isolation
With these SE215, it's not the case, thus they're very comfortable to me
Cons:- the cord is a little bit too long- how about offering the SE215 m+ style, with integrated mike and remote
You would think there are enough iphone/ipad users who would be interested
Paying another $50 for their mobile remote is not a good solution
It adds more cord (which is already too long) and the mike is far away from your mouth and sounds too loud to people
They were great until they stopped working
I have had them for 3 months, treated them well but the left ear bud stopped working
I expected more from sure
Very displeased
These headphones sound excellent right out the box, although im not a huge fan of the foam plugs i took these off and put the rubber ones on and perfect
These are very comfortable to wear
When I had read the reviews before buying them alot of people complained about switching out the tips, they are absoulety right, these are very hard to change I was at work when i changed them out for the first time and had access to a microscope, On the directions it reads to twist and pull, this will probaly break the end off them like other reviews had stated, I on the other hand peeled them off
I stuck my finger nail under it and peel back(I dont have much for nails) and was able to get these off faily easy and change them out
Know for the important thing the sound, I have alot of earphones and one of my prized earphones which is some DENON AHC710 which are $200
00 and thats a very modest price
these might actually sound better not quite yet but the shure are not broke in yet
Everything is balanced so perfectly plenty of bass thats not distorted, the highs are no overbarring and the mids are just right
The only thing Im waiting for is the snap on the low end bass like my denons have and these will be right there with them
I like the cord it seems really strong and the fact that you can disconnect them is cool
All in all very happy with my purchase
I bought these at guitar center and the guy said these sound better then the SE315 and on par with a few exceptions as the SE 535
You cant go wrong
By the way these are being powered bt a ZUNE HD and soon a COWON J3
As an audio enthusiast I have used many sets of headphones from Sennheiser, Bose, Beats, etc
But these Shure earphones/sound monitors are the best I've used so far
They fit comfortably after getting used to and don't look ridiculous but rather inconspicuous
Overall great earphones
5 Star rating from me
The Shure SE-215 earbuds are very sturdy and sound good
They fit flush to the ear, and they block sound without being uncomfortably deep into the ear
They are very comfortable and light--so much so that you almost forget that they are there
They come with standard accessories like differently-sized foam and silicone tips, carrying case, and cleaning tool
The 3
5mm jack is pretty wide, so you may not be able to plug these headphones into a phone with a thick case on it
The 64-inch cable is pretty thick and should hold up to the damages of daily use
All-in-all, these are good headphones for the price, and they are definitely worth a try
I was looking for noise reducing headphones that were not $400 and but worth owning
This by far is the best deal out there right now
I searched far and wide as I play acoustic drums but love the ability to play along with music in the background if not live on stage
This works perfect and is essentially like having full foam ear plugs in with the ability to hear the music cleanly throug a monitor
A few years ago I really started listening to music and then a ton
(Prob 3-5 hrs a week now)
I started off with crappy standard iPod earbuds
Then I jumped around the low-end cheap skullcandy ink'd several times where they would break usually a month or so
Getting really frustrated, I got the motivation to actually spend some money
Researched for a while and waited a week cause these earbuds were back ordered
Now having them for a month, I love them
Great fit(it comes with a good package of different sizes and materials of parts that will fit anyone's ear), they also don't protrude out of you ear so you can sleep comfortably on your side, the bass is nice, sound cancel very well, the music is clear even when the volume is loud and quiet, the cord is thick, dependable, and doesn't tangle easy, the jack is nice and everything on the SHURE SE-215 is sturdy and well designed
The around the ear chord style though a little difficult to figure out at first is great so the earbuds don't fall out easy
Great price for these earbuds and I'd happily pay a lot more than $100
The earbuds are great
They have some serious bass
That said, the sound is incredibly well balanced
The only flaw I can point out is that the highs are slightly weak
Still, 5-star earbuds

I bought these head phones based on the reviews here at Amazon
I normally use over the ear head phones because I've never been able to find an in the ear model that feels comfortable or delivers the rich sound of over the ear models
and still haven't
These ear phones are a big disappointment
Very uncomfortable and when I could get them positioned the sound was horrible as compared to over the ear models
I would love to find in the ear phones for when exercising because the over the ear models just look dorky
but will have to just give up
I've tried several of the in ear models and had high hopes for the Shure SE215, but will have to resign to the fact my ears were not made for "In the Ear" phones
The Shure SE215 are very, very nice and worth every cent
Fantastic well balanced sound and well thought out and balanced as well
After I finally figured out the red dot is on the right plug and started compressing the foam before insertion, I was set for a pleasant listening experience
I rate them favorably with my Sennheiser HD590 headphones, which is amazing
Great with few minor complaints
I just got my Shure SE215 Clear earphones
I immediately tried them and road-tested them
Overall they are awesome except few complaints
I hope this doesn't damper your dream of owning one
Good: Sound Quality and noise reduction:Excellent and Awesome
I could hear even the weakest background note clear
Sound is well balanced
The Bass is perfect, not artificially amp'd to give you headache
These earphones block most of the outside noise
I swear
On the LIRR train ride between my place and Penn station in NYC, I couldn't hear a decibel of outside noise
I couldn't hear the loud station announcement, not the loud chatter of girls sitting next to you, not the train sound
Nada
This was not possible with my old earphones
These are perfect for outdoor listening but watch where you use it (read on)Bad: Noise reduction:It blocks way too much noise to be used where you shouldn't be using an earphone - like biking, walking on the street or crossing roads
Your ears tend to get heavy after an hour of listening
Probably because this earphone blocks most of the noise and all you listen is just music
It just isn't healthy for ears
Take breaks every half an hour to relieve your ear pressure
Bad: Style & looks: It takes a little effort to get used to wearing these but they fit perfectly firm
I bought the clear model as I was attracted by the shiny new silver like finsh in the photo
I thought they are a perfect show off but I'm disappointed
The SE215-CL looks much dull than in real-life than in picture
You can't see it unless you open the package
Since these fit in a certain weird way - like around your ear, I have people staring at me in public
Not sure if it is good or bad
If style and look matters to you, checkout a real life picture of  CLEAR and BLACK before purchasing
Note: B&H photo store in NYC has SE215-CL for $89 ($10 less than black)
Don't know why
Good: Cord: Cord quality is awesome
It has kevlar coating and unlike rubber I don't think it will break or tear
It is one of the reasons I chose this over Etymotic or Klipsch
And the most convenient thing is that the cord is behind your ears when you wear them and they don't fall in front of your face when you bend down
Bad: Cord: It just won't bend as much as the rubber cord does
A really really minor concern
Overall: Sound quality matters to me more than looks
I just wish they had made the CLEAR ones like shown in the picture
Just saying
Given I already own other "higher ticket" Sure (SE 315, SE 425, and SE 535) and Westone UM2 and 3, as well as about 4 other pairs of high quality earphones ( although all were before replaceable cables), I am absolutely blown away by the overall quality and value of these earphones so far
The convenience and simplicity of Westone cables is the best I have ever used but the overall sound quality and extremely reasonable cost of the Sure SE215 earphones have already become my absolute favorites
These definitely take a bit of cable manipulation to optimize comfort per individual but the overall sound is terrific
The mids and highs are sharp and bass not sacrificed
I actually think Westone has not adequately adressed the mid/highs which is important to me
I look forward to giving an update in a month or two but so far I would recommend these earphones over almost anything I own that cost more
Prior to the SE215 i had EC2 and SCL2s
Loved both of them but managed to lose them both
Frankly
at this point, I'm glad I did
The SE215s are the best sounding headphones I've ever had
Far superior sound to both the SCL2s and EC2s
Great separation, strong but not overly heavy bass
Highs and mid are clear, with somewhat airy and transparent presence
Some have complained about this fit -it's possible that if your ears are small, they may not be comfortable
They are a very different kind of fitting headphone
The body of the ear piece fits in the belly of your ear
Looks almost like a hearing aid
For me, they are comfortable and i run the cable over my ear
This style is much more sound isolating then the previous SHures I mentioned
Cable is a wee bit long, which is a bit of a hassle for working out
I need to get some kind of clip or run it under my shirt
Some folks complained about noise from the cables (rubbing against shirt, each other, etc)
I have not experienced that noise
Highly recommend
I love 'em
I don't do may reviews, I do it just for products I consider either really good or really bad
These monitors are part of the former group
The sound is amazing
Low, mid and high frequencies are masterfully balanced
I used to have the Shure E2C, and although they sound good, I wasn't thrilled about their bass
I'm not a bass head, but I like to be able to hear the presence of drums and bass in my music
Although the E2Cs did a good job, they were not excellent
The SE215 blow the E2Cs out of the water in every single part of the sound spectrum
I don't think you need a burn-in period with these (although I burned them in for about 14 hrs beforefirst use)
Fit is just great, extremely comfortable, much better than the E2Cs
They isolate outside noise very well
I just bought them and I am extremely happy
At this price, it is a no brainer
I feel a little bit more sane after reading the negative reviews of the SE215s that mention the flaw regarding the left ear piece
Of course, most of those reviews were written just after I purchased them and also after the small window I had to return them
At least I'm not the only one
and at least I don't feel like I'm literally cursed when it comes to ear buds
Yes, the left ear piece also inexplicably died after about a month and a half of actual use
Right now, I can either listen to them and have the left ear drop out every time I move my head (which causes a new level of Rage)
or I can send them back for replacements and expect the same thing to happen
Guess I'll send them back as they're still under warranty, though it's way past the time by which I could return them
I dished out good money because of the Shure name, so to say this is disappointing is a major understatement
This is extremely annoying/enraging
I like the sound on the SE215s, I like the fact that there's no wire noise, and they drowned out sound pretty well, so much so that (if they worked) I could well by run over by a bus as I was trying to adjust the left ear piece in the street
The design and fit on these is strange, so please take note (aside from the fact that they, you know, BREAK after a couple of months)
These are like in-ear monitors
the piece goes all the way into your ear (so you can feel like Bono or someone on stage), and annoyingly, the wire goes up and around and back of your ear
which I suspected was why they may have given out since I was constantly adjusting them
No, only the left one
The design is odd and definitely not for everyone (unless, again, you love adjusting wires and sticking them behind your ears/hair)
The other thing, oh yeah, THEY BREAK EASILY
Forget about "burning them in"---what's the point
The 50 hours that will take is a fraction of the time the things will actually work in your ear
Thanks, Shure
I think by the time I'm done buying ear buds I'll have paid enough money to get the iPod installed in my cranium, where I can never turn it off
NOT recommended
The left ear piece stopped functioning just like other reviews stated here
The sad part is that it happened right after the 30 day return policy date
Checked with Amazon and the rep informed me that I have to contact manufacturer for replacement
I would avoid this product as this issue seems to be way too common
I need noise canceling earphones and already familiar with SHURE products, I opted to buy a pair of Live Sound monitors
I find them awkward to use because they have to be adjusted over the ear each time you use them
The wire is soft and once you take them out, the wire straightens itself out
The purpose of buying this kind of monitor was so that I could place them over my ears, so twisting each one into place each time I used them was annoying
The left one shorted out from turning
The RT
ear is marked in red, the left in blue
You must find this color each time you use them
They are fragile and would not stay in the shape I had placed them
Although the sound effect was good, the product is substandard in my opinion
SHURE is generally a good brand too buy, but not this product
I have found these difficult to use but liked the sound quality when I got them on
They are very hard for me to put on my ears
Complete garbage
From first use, right out of the box noticed slight head movements caused static and cut-out
Returning asap
Love them, they have amazing sound quality
I tried out the $300 Beats headphones after i got these and the shures sounded better in my opinion and they are only $80
These earbuds are a steal
I needed new headphones for my ipod, something practical, yet with good sound quality
Before this I had the Klipsch S4, which provided really good sound quality, but the cable didn't last long
So after doing some research I got this ones, and I'm not totally happy about them
Yes, the sound quality is awesome, but they are really uncomfortable, they even kinda hurt, and just to get them on I need some sort of manual
The other issue I have with them is the sound isolation feature
Even though it works incredibly, I never thought it would be an issue for when I went out and around
I like to listen music while commuting or just out walking, but adding to the fact that they are uncomfortable and hard to get on/off, it gets me slightly paranoid not to listen to anything around me but my music, just something to keep in mind
And even though I can't listen to anything around me, I can listen to my steps, and that can be really annoying
So even though they are good at doing their job, we are not a good fit
Completely fantastic
I typically ride with 33dB hearing protection
These are even better, and I can listen to music
Sound quality is excellent
Sound isolation is truly impressive
Excellent sound when they worked
This is my second pair of Sure headphones, and the audio drivers are better than ever, but
the connector piece to the ear-bud is junk
After one month the sound would cut in and out from the slightest movement
Now no sound at all
This problem is wide spread with this design
Just read the other reviews for sure headphones with this same design
It's as if they never field tested these
I have owned these headphones for several months now, and I am so pleased
My friend has the top of the line shure ear phones ($500), and I spent a weekend listening to them, and decided that my collection of $5-30 dollar headphones just weren't enough
The shure se215 had just come out and had gotten some glowing reviews, so I took a couple extra tutoring jobs and bought these amazing headphones
You can tell the difference between the se535s and the 215s, but they are surprisingly close in quality, and way better than the bose headphones that a lot of my friends have
The audio is so clear, the sound isolation is fantastic, they are light and comfortable, and with the right music, they are magic
I did have to replace my first set because of a funky wire in the left earphone, but shure was great about getting them to me quickly and for free, they even covered the cost that I had to pay to ship the faulty ones back
Great product
Great service
I am hooked
I bought these headphones because I was looking for something different
The design of these headphones gave me a bad headache all the time
The headphones are designed to go into your ear canal for better sound
I started to get used to them would still get mild headaches after listening to them for a long time, like during workouts
Great sounding headphones but if you got sensitive ears, which I guess I do, get something else
These headphones also do not stay in your ear during long workouts where you sweat a lot
Good luck finding some that don't, but for 100 dollars I at least don't want headaches
Five stars for sound, Two stars for comfort only
I am a huge fan of Klipsch Earphones ~ unbeknownst to me why on a whim, I purchased these for iPod use, but I am so very glad I did
The sound coming from them straight out of the box is incredible - really, just blows Klipsch out of the water (hey, it surprised me, too ;o) )
I could hear tones using these earphones that I never knew existed using the Klipsch
The sound is very well balanced and rich ~ clarity
outstanding
I LOVE the slightly longer cable
Watch out - the ear sleeves are really hard to change
It was much easier to change detaching the cable and I used a toothpick to pry up under the sleeve ~ once I did that - it didn't take me two minutes to change them out (figuring that out of course took longer than that ;o) )
It's taken me a little while to get used to the cord going over the ear style - but take them on and off a few times and it's no problem
For the person who said the Noise Isolating was a "con" ~ to me, it's not - they are, after all, 'sound isolating' earphones right
It's a plus and it definitely works :o) (and there are warnings in teh packaging not to use in any place you *need* to hear surrounding noises)I love they fit inside the ear, too ~ I can sleep with them in very comfortably
I'm not an audiophile to the point where I have spent thousands on amps and headphones, but I do have an ear for music
These Shure earphones are not only an upgrade in physical quality but sound and quality as well
Comparing these to the previous generation, the bass has been much improved
As I've read in other reviews the highs do somewhat lack but for $100 high end earphones, you can't expect the very best
I mainly use these as a personal monitor when I play the drums and immediately noticed the improvement in sound quality than my previous set
I was able to hear my bass very clearly and my drums simply sounded much better just by listening to them through my earphones
They fit so naturally and comfortably in my ear they truly are no bother at all
The malleable first couple of inches is great for preventing the cable moving around too much
The removable cable has not caused any sort of issues and I just hope it stays that way
Shure has always made great quality products so I doubt it will be an issue
If you truly care about the music you listen to, dump those silly Skull Candy earphones and pick up a pair of a real earphones
When the earphones work, they sound amazing
Unfortunately for me this is the 2nd pair ive recieved that has a defective left earphone
Sound will hiss, cut in and out when i move around
Sometimes i can move my head slightly and find the sweet spot that will completely cut sound out
This must be a design flaw because ive read up on other shure models, and similar problems happen to others left earbud
I had a terrible experience with Shure and their customer service
I enjoyed the headphones but they were of a very low quality, failing within 12 months of buying them
They had a 2 year warranty so I sent them in and had them fixed/replaced
I used the replacement set for another 12 months and they failed again
I attempted to return the headphones for a second time but was informed my warranty expired 2-3 weeks before contacting the company
They were used for very light use and as an engineer in charge of quality at a manufacturing company I'd have to say these have a failed design
Stick to the headphones that come with your iPod or try another manufacturer
Update: Did send it out for repairs, and they were replaced, 2 years and they are still working just fine
They sound great, but only after a month the left headphone stopped working
It was not damaged or abused so I can only assume it is a fallowed unit
Anytime I purchase anything, I find I peruse Amazon for its customer reviews, and decided to finally post, and hopefully this will help someone in a similar situation find what they are looking for
That being said, I was looking for a quality set of in-ear buds that would be: immersive in its sound range, fun with a significant amount of bass, and durable in its build quality
Iphone functionality would be a big plus as well
My budget was around $100-125
I purchased the Sennheiser CX series earbuds, which were obnoxiously bright and yellow
I got a great deal from a friend, so decided to try them
I also purchased the Shure S115i, and the Klipsch S4i, with the full intentions of settling on one and returning the rest to Apple
The Sennheisers were pretty mediocre all around, and I use them when I know I'll be beating them up on a long run
I loved the warm tones of the 115s, but they lacked the oomph in the low end I was really looking for
The S4i I have to say, was the most fun out of all three
The bass is killer, and I actually find the oval tips rather comfortable
However, the build quality is absolutely shocking, and ended up being a dealbreaker for me
I returned all of them and decided I'd continue my search
I stumbled across the 215s on here and decided to check them out after seeing so many positive reviews
The build is fantastic
The cable isn't kevlar, but seems to be a thick rubber, and is fully replaceable
I love the design of the buds, and after a little molding of the behind-ear cabling, it fits and feels great
I truly love the foam tips, and the flat design is easy to lay on if you are in bed listening to them
Sound quality is what I expected, and was pleasantly surprised with the bass response
Mids and highs come in crisp and clean, and the bass kicks without being boomy
You are not going to get the earth-rattling bass of the S4 but it definitely holds its own, and is very defined and tight
My collection of music ranges from bass-heavy dubstep to acoustic rock, and it plays every track clean and accurately
I almost wish it had just a touch more kick-in-the-pants bass boom to it, but I wouldnt sacrifice the clean and tightness that you get here for it
All in all though, I stand behind this as my favorite of the bunch
I don't have the sophisticated ears of an audiophile, but I enjoy losing myself in every subtle note when I listen to music
I really found what I was looking for in these, and recommend them for anyone looking for Shure quality and build with the added bass thats missing from the 115s
I've previously owned the E2C which I liked but like many users had experienced, mine broke 3 times within 2 years because of exposed copper wires
Although Shure would replace them for free each time they broke but it was still quite annoying
There're a few things that I really like about the SE215 in comparison to the E2C:-The packaging is extremely easy to open
I no longer have to slice open a rock with my scissors/cutter just to get the earphones out
-Comes with a earwax removal tool which is helpful in keeping them clean
-Stronger bass and better overall sound quality
-The cord does seem a tad sturdier and is detachable, which allows easier replacement just in case it breaks again
But I hope it won't come down to that
If I'm not mistaken, these earphones come with a 2-year warranty during which Shure will replace your earphones for free

These headphones are fantastic
I ride the subway every day and the noise isolation is great
They fit comfortably and they make talk radio and heavy base music alike sound amazing
The cables are the sturdiest of any headphones I have ever had
as if that isn't enough, they are also replaceable
The noise isolation is far better than Klipsch s4 headphones and they are just as comfortable
Noise isolation is on par with Etymotic m3 headphones, but these are far more comfortable
I did notice some cable noise with these headphones but it seems to be coming from the behind-the-ear portion, which is a bit "springy
" Overall, these are by far the best $100 and under headphones I have owned thus far
but it's fixed itself suddenly
I was walking with these buds on when the right one had a weaker sound
I remembered reading a review that these suckers broke on the first try, and the curse seems to have victimized me for the time being
Right now, it works perfectly like new, but if it does suddenly break like it did before, I am going to return these garbage
/rantBut besides that, these are fine, very fine, earphones
Luxury and quality earphones at your disposal for $100
You will probably be one of the world's 0
1% total population to be able to experience Shure's SE215-CL and be half blown away and half "pleasurized" by it
I have owned a set of Bose In-Ear headphones and these win as twice as much better
However, the way these earphones are supposed to be worn isn't very "conventional" but you'll get used to wearing them after a minute or two of "practicing
" (I couldn't figure out which one goes to my left or right ear
How silly was I
The bud that points towards the left indicates it's meant for your left ear and vice versa
)Btw, I also owned ATH-A700 and I actually prefer these to AT
Enjoy your music with these devils (paradoxically)
Oh, and I will come back and give these five stars if these devils don't suddenly break after a week's use
edit: Ok, I just found the reason
It did not BREAK
It just happened so that I put the bud in one of my ears so tightly that it blocks out sounds, as confusing as it sounds, but I now know the problem
Also I just remembered that my right ear canal is a tiny bit smaller than that of my left, so that explains the supposed mythical flaw
GET THESE
It took for me about 3 days of burn in and they are fantastic
Amazing sound, noise isolation  (with the right foam)  and comfort
They're almost comparable to their 5x more expensive cousins -the  SE530s - which I've been using for about 3 years now
I've used other sound isolating earphones over the years in the $50-500 range and for $100 these are very impressive - I will be getting a couple more to give as presents
Highly recommended
Just bought and am loving it
Had the Klipsch S4's before
Although the sound quality was great, the comfort was terrible and the quality of the wires were bad
After one year of use, the right ear stopped working
Tried the Bose MIE2 at the store
The fit was awkward and was not noise isolating
The quality was only good when you pressed the earbuds into your ear
I like pros/cons list, so this is how I'm going to do my review for the Shure se215Pros:-For this class and price range of in ear headphones, absolutely amazing sound quality
Crisp sounds, great bass
-Was skeptical of the different fit
However, it conforms to your ears very well
The tips are also more foamy than rubbery which creates a nice comfortable fit-Wires are replaceable
GENIUS
Cons:-The wire is a bit bulky and long
This could become annoying if I had to store in jeans pocket, etc
But I guess it's a tradeoff for durabilityI also bought the iPhone mobile accessory
Although a bit steep at $50, I think it's worth it
Great functionality (volume, next/last track, forward, play/pause)
The cable is also shorter (but a still a little bulky)
Bottom Line:  After a lot of research and debate, I am very satisfied with my purchase
They sound ok, but they are a very poorly designed set of earphones
The cord makes a lot of noise, when it rubs agaisnt my clothing and at the table
They don't feel great inside my ears and it is very uncomfortable to wear then on the go
I also must say that the cord is unnecessarily long
I am 6 feet 3 and there is too much cord hanging when I stand up
I also tried then for a quick run and hated the experience
I really wantes shure phones, but I am already searching for another brand
MY OPINION:Durability of the spliced ends:  I get a new pair of earbuds pretty much every year because the wires (where they attach into the earbuds) eventually get worn and break
I'm a 44 year old woman and wear them for running or while on the elliptical (so general wear and tear)
Being that I have professionally done the same type of splices that where done on these "refurbished" earbuds, I know that these splices cannot withstand (for very long) the movement that they will be subjected to if one uses them when exercising
I would never recommend that splice with a wire that will be moving around very much
Cost of this refurbishment:  I had already spliced my old pair (at home--for free), with a much more reliable splice job (so I guess I'll keep using my old ones until I order NEW ones)
I'm curious as to how the seller feels he/she rates to charge $99 for this repair splice, that takes about 5 mins
I really have to question the ethics of that
Next issue with these earbuds:  I have a pair of the old Shure 215's, which I purchased about a year ago, only mine are better because they have a part that can be used with a cell phone
I may have missed that feature in these refurbished ones, but I would expect the newer version to have, at a minimum, the same features--not less
My last issue is that now I'm being charged to ship them back because I'm not willing to settle for the quality of this product
And I also paid to ship them to me
I feel like I got jacked since the earbuds are junk--in my opinion
By the way, the replacement ends (when you need to change them out), I think I saw somewhere that they cost $40 by themselves
For that amount, you've spent about half the amount of the original cost of the refurbished ones
I have owned these earphones for about a month now
I don't know if I would consider myself an audiophile, but I enjoy my music when it sounds good
When my old pair of Sony earbuds fell apart, I decided it was time to step up to an entirely new level of earbud sophistication
After some research, I decided on the Shure SE215, which had received many favorable reviews
Plus, at roughly $100, the price was reasonable compared to other kinds of headphones out on the market
Ultimately, the Shure SE215s are the best sounding in-ear headphones I have ever heard
There were, however, a few initial problems with these earphones
This next portion of the review is going to sound overwhelmingly negative, but bear with me
The first problem I had with these earphones came down to comfort
For the first week or two of ownership, the SE215 is a difficult headphone to wear comfortably, and finding an easy way to wear them is a long and awkward process
The SE215 is shaped quite differently than any other earphone I have owned, and therefore resulted in some unique kinds of ear pain and fatigue from even the briefest periods of use
The cable on the SE215 is designed to curve up and over the ear, which was once again completely different from any other earphone I have used
Problem is, the cable is quite rigid and will not curve around the ear easily
In fact, it took me a good three hours before I had found a way to keep the earphones in my ears without the cable falling off and bumping into my cheek, which was annoying
Then, after I found a way to keep the earphones in my ears, the next issue presented itself
They sounded terrible, alternating between a slightly "tinny" sound with no bass and having the right earphone muted in comparison to the left earphone
This was confusing, because the SE215 was supposedly the best sounding earphone in the world for the price
Now, any sane person would be asking themselves why I gave these earphones a perfect 5/5 if I had such a rough time with them
Rest assured, there is a light at the end of this tunnel
Allow me to explain
The ear pain and fatigue is common with any new kind of earphone
As mentioned before, I have owned Sony earphones over the years
I remember each one of those headphones bothering my ears for the first few weeks of ownership
Eventually, your ears just get used to the new earphones, which leads to lessened pain and fatigue
After a month or so of regularly listening to them, the SE215 no longer fatigues my ears
They are actually rather comfortable
The cable has also limbered up a bit, making it easier to fold up and around my ears than before
But the biggest improvements have to be attributed to the foam "sleeves" included with the SE215
These headphones come out of the box with six pairs of interchangeable "sleeves," which are the parts of the earphone you insert into your ear
Three pairs are rubber, and three pairs are made of a fragile foam
Having no experience with foam sleeves, I immediately attempted the rubber sleeves
I am not too sure why these earphones come with rubber sleeves, because they are largely useless
The rubber sleeves refused to stay in my ears and made the earphones sound awful
So I moved on to the foam sleeves, which were a revelation
Not only are they very comfortable, but the foam sleeve really allow the Shure SE215s to work their magic
In order to work properly, the instructions state that the earphones must have a good seal against the outside world
The foam sleeves provide that seal, leading to a sound experience that rivals even the audiophile-spec Sennheiser HD 595s I use for serious stereo listening
The foam sleeves are fragile, though, so handle and replace them with care
The Shure SE215 really is a fine piece of audio equipment
They sound phenomenal, easily matching much more expensive headphones and outclassing everything I have tried up to this point in my life
There are some initial problems, but these problems will either go away over time or can be erased entirely by using the foam sleeves
I would not use them for exercise, but that's what a cheap pair of earbuds are for
I highly recommend the Shure SE215 to anyone wanting an amazing earphone
So I have been reading qualitative and quantitative reviews for probably the biggest market right now, earbuds in the $100 range
Obviously these aren't going to be your bottom basement earbuds but they aren't going to be world class monitor earbuds either
I think it's a great range for your enthusiast who is willing to spend some extra money for a better product
Initial Comments: I have had a few good earbuds but most of them are almost disposable
I was in the market for earbuds around $100, give or take a few bucks
I had narrowed it down to these Shures and the Sony MDR-510
I have always been partial to Sony earbuds since I bought a bluetooth headset for my phone to listen to music w/o cords to the phone
The only issue is the Shure's are widely recognized and reviews are aplenty
The Sonys were just released and almost little to no decent reviews by any major website or amazon
I chose the Shures and it's almost a regret
Pros: First off the cord seems up to the job
It feels heavy and somewhat stiff, it's not going to rip under normal usage
Some don't like the long cord but I do (although the Sony's have an option for a long cord or short)
The case is normal, a stock item in this level of earbuds
I like the different sizes / materials for the earbuds as well
The little tool to clean the earbuds is a nice touch (I'm a bit of a germophobe)
I like the replaceable cords
The earbuds look nice but that doesn't really matter to me since I want performance and performance they give
Obviously I have never had this level of earbud but there are definitely the best I've had
That being so, I felt some of the reviews overly hyped these earbuds
I get over the "new product hype" and take a more pessimistic view for almost all of my purchases
They fit really comfortably in my ears and I love I can lay down with them in
I have been flying to and from the states to Asian countries so comfort for 14 hour flights was a must
These work well
Cons: So obviously they're great headphones but I feel people want to hear the short comings more so than overall praise
First, these are the first earbuds I have had that wrap the cord around the top of the ear and down
While that helps keep the cord out of the way and more stable, the cord is too stiff and so they kind of don't hug my ear well
Sometimes the cord itself "swings" away from my ears and hits my cheek
I have tried to bend them to be more tight against my ear but to no avail
Also I wear glasses, sometimes taking off sunglasses or my glasses will pull on the cord
The biggest con I have so far is intermittent cutting off of sound
I don't know if it's these particular pair or the earbuds themselves, I have not see anyone else have this issue
Sometimes I move around and my left earbud will cut out of sound
Now it's kind of random because I will bob my head around and it won't cut off
Mind you I am sitting the whole time, I'm not running or exercising
I have never had an earbud cutout like this
Maybe it's the fact that the cords are replaceable is causing the cutoff
I find this has almost ruined my whole experience with these earbuds
Unfortunately I bought these a week before I left the country and have been gone for 4 weeks (I'm still out of the country)
So I can't return them although if Shure's warranty is as great as I hear, I shouldn't have a problem getting them replaced, fixed, whatever is necessary to have them not cut out
$100 pair of headphones shouldn't cut out, even my cheap $15 audio tecknica's have never had this issue
So there you go
Yes there are very good, probably one of the top sub-$100 earbuds
They are comfortable and should last
The only reason it's getting 3 stars right now is the cutoff
I mean that is almost a deal breaker at this price
I was very excited to buy these headphones a week ago
I'm not an audiophile but received some bose in-ear headphones a few years ago as a gift and loved them
until they stopped working due a problem with the cord/wiring, which seems to be a common issue
I was sold on the sound quality of the Shure headphones and other customers' reviews
So, I picked these up in anticipation of a big overseas trip
Well the headphones showed up and worked great for two days
Then, the left earbud inexplicably stopped working altogether
I had specifically bought these b/c I liked that the cord was detachable from the earbuds - after the cord issue w/my Bose I thought this was a great product feature
Well - that doesn't mean jack if the earbud stops working
after ~4 hours of light use
Not sure if it was a lemon or what
but bottom-line, Shure needs to do a better job w/quality control
Judging from the few other posts on here, I'm not the only one to have them break after a few days of use
the sound was good while it lasted
I hate shopping in general and there is nothing worse that doing your research, making an educated product purchasing decision, and then feeling like you got screwed due to cheap manufacturing practices
I was looking for an upgrade to my Etymotics which I like very much but were lacking in lower end frequency response
I had listened to the Shure SE 425 and 525's but $400 or $500 for in ear iPod headsets
I'm not cheap but have a problem spending twice as much money for an accessory as I paid for the device
I read a review on the Shure SE215 and decided at $99 to buy a pair
So far they're great
I'm a part time musician so I'm pretty picky about my music
The SE215's have a big sound, perhaps a little bass heavy but since I'm a bass player I like that
Cons: This is not a small in the ear and the design makes you experiment a bit to get the right position and feel
Once in properly you are not going to forget you're wearing a headset
Several people have talked about left ear hiss
So far no problems here but I've only had the set for a few weeks
note 1: ALL Shure earbuds WILL experience problems after 6 months
however, Shure provides excellent 2-yr warranty
you ship the merchandise back to Shure and they return good units in about 2 weeks
note 2: SE215CL or SE215K
according to Shure, they are one and the same except the casing and wire, CL is "clear" transparent casing and wiring
K is black casing and wiring
i own BOTH however, for some reasons i found the K (black) much better sound than CL
if i had to do it again, i will go for K (black casing)
i have been using Shure earbuds since 2005e3c, e5c, SE215, SE435
all extremely good earbuds priced from $100-$400
by my assessment, SE215 is the best earbud ($99) consider the price to benefit rationo doubt you get better more refined sound in SE435 and e5c (discontinued) but the additional pricing (300% more) certainly does not deliver 300% better sound
i would say for the additional $200 you pay for SE435, you get at best 10%-15% better sound compared to the SE215
conclusion:if money is not an issue, buy the SE435 or even SE535, they are really good
but if you want to be smart consumer, and don't mind 10%-15% less sound quality, SE215K is what you need
Update, my left earbud stopped working
It seems the connection went bad and its not the wire but the earbud part
Now I have to send this in for repair
Not a very well constructed earbud because they are so fragile
I had the old Shure headphones from back in 2006 that finally broke at the connector so I needed a new replacement
These sound great with a good balance of sound
Overall sound is much better than my old pair
The wire that goes over the ear is cumbersome, I'm still not used to it but once you bend the wire near the ear and cinch the rubber thing up its secure
I expect the speaker part to last awhile, and if the wire goes bad you just have to replace that part which is great
Approved
I had the Bose IE headphones before these, and there is no comparison, these have such clearer mids and highs, and you can really feel the bass in these earbuds
They also sound better than my qc2s, which is pretty surprising considering the price difference, although I cannot speak to comparing them to the newer qc15s
It takes a little while to figure out just how to get the earbuds fitting comfortably, and in the right position
If they don't sound incredible right from the start, you're probably not wearing them right
If the silicone or foam tip is not in the right position to give you a nice noise isolating seal and get the sound directly into your ear, they sound like completely mediocre headphones
With a little adjustment, you should be able to feel a good seal, preventing most outside noise, and then they will sound amazing
I take a train into a city everyday, and they cancel out almost all outside noise, making for a great morning commute
They handle everything beautifully and most of my music sounds like I'm listening to it for the first time
Jazz (Miles Davis, Ella and Louis) sounds richer and more dynamic than I've ever heard
One of the most interesting things about the Shures is that in areas of songs where extreme highs used to be grating on my ears using other headphones, on these they sound more balanced, much less harsh, and more like the notes were probably intended
Rock, classical, pop and bluegrass all sound amazing, but the Shure 215s are most impressive when you throw bass-heavy music at them
Daft Punk sounds like you're at a live concert, and the bass rocks like you would not believe
All in all, these are incredible earbuds that deserve all the praise they're getting
Highly recommended
Pros - As I've come to expect of all Shure earphones, the sound quality on these babies is excellent
And the noise isolation is as it should be
I'm no audiophile per-se, but I personally can't settle for less than this kind of quality in a set of earphones
Con's - Compared to the 115's and 210s, the 215's construction is a bit trickier to learn to fit properly
But once you get used to them, you can come to appreciate their ergonomic form
They sound fantastic, but the plug is so BIG that you cannot use it with an iPone 4 if you want to use a case on your iPhone
This was a huge deal breaker for me
Returned
After looking at comparable earphones from Klipsch, Etymotics and  Shure, I decided to settle on Shure's SE-215
The SE-215 delivers in sound quality
Highs are crisp, mids are clear and lows produce some great bass (pending you have the proper cushions in place)
Compared to the Klipsch S4, the SE-215 has richer mid's and the bass was more tonal compared to the slightly "boomy" klipsch drivers
All in all the sound quality was above my expectations for a pair or earphones costing approximately $100
My only gripe about the set was the cable
It's very long but more than that, the 2 inches closest to the earbuds are made up of this thicker material that is god-awfully frustrating
Bending it to the contours around your ear is tough, especially when moving and it's prone to come loose during rigorous activity (Marathon Running / Rock Climbing)
Thank god you can replace the cable but it should have came with something a bit more manageable
(that I've tried)I mostly listen to full sized phones but wanted a pair of IEMs for working out and for days when i don't want to lug my ah-d2000's to work
I started out with the thinksound ts01
It had amazing spacial details but was all bass, few mids and hardly any treble
(costs less than se215)Next i tried the Sennheiser ie6 (costs more than the se215)they had the mids that i missed in the thinksounds but were veiled from the mids onward
After the Senn's broke I switched to these, priced between the aforementioned models i found the to have the most balanced sound signature
They don't really play up into the highest treble regions, but they do have better treble than the previously mentioned phones
The mids are the real star of the show on these phones, but the bass is HUGE when the seal is right
These phones literally have some of the best bass ive encountered
huge and full while maintaining punch and clarity
they lack the depth of the senns or thinksounds but they have  much better balance
They dont come close to my ah-d2000's in depth or clarity but those are full sized cans at 3 times the price so its not a fair comparison
I do prefer them to my 7506's though
Being as the sound tube goes kind-of far into the ear, im not sure id want more treble anyway, any sibilance is bad sibilance in that sort of situation
The isolation on these things is crazy good, and could be dangerous in the right circumstance (jogging by a busy road would be out of the question)
outside noise can barely get in, with music at even low volume you cant hear a thing
These are my second pair of Shure earbuds
My first were the SE115 and I loved them
They fit snug like earplugs and had great bass
When they finally died after 2 years I was planning to buy them again, but came across the se215s
since 100 bucks is the sweet spot for earbuds for me, I got these since there was not a price huge difference to upgrade
ProsThe earbuds can detached at the ear, so if you mess up the cord all is not lost
Great soundPrice is rightConsThis is just a personal preference, but on the se115 the cord detached where the earbud cords came together
You could buy an accessory cord for phone/ipod controls
I liked this because I could detached the cord without taking off my earbuds and put the cord under my shirt, and it would disconnect there instead of ripping out of my ears or damaging my ipod if it got snagged
Also, these are meant to wrap around the backside of your ears
There is a wire that bends around
After researching forever I went with Shure
The Bose I had heard and not to impressed with, so I thought I would try these
The lows, mids and highs were great for my listening habits
Also being able to remove the cables and replace them are great
Try them
They are great
The sound quality of these headphones is great and they are a good value for the money
However, they don't seem to fit well in my ear
They keep falling out so I can't wear them when I exercise
$100
00
Insanity for what you get
And don't get me wrong, I mean that in the best way possible
For the money, these things are awesome
For comparison, I previously owned a pair of SE115's that I was a pretty big fan of
Those weren't quite what I was hoping for, but they were cheap
Well, I had some extra money so I started looking for a new pair of earbuds
I looked at Shure's line because I've always been a huge fan - the company makes good earbuds
Well, I looked at the SE215's and the SE315's
For the money, most people seemed more impressed with the SE215's, so that's what I went with
They are awesome
Get them, you won't regret it
A huge step up from the 115's
I can't get these things to stay in my ears
I've tried all the different sizes of attachments, and none of them keep these headphones in my ears
I'm just annoyed because instead of listening to my music, I spend the entire time attempting to keep the earbuds in my ears
Right now I'm sitting in a library trying to get some work done, but I'm spending the time trying to keep these stupid things in my ears
I guess I'll have to do without music
So far it's seems like these were a waste of $100
I think I might try to sell them and shop around for another nice pair of earbuds
I have some nice can headphones for home, but I want a nice pair of earbuds for when I'm out and about
Does anyone have any suggestions for about the same price
After having had many sets of headphones that were good, but not great - they each lacked something: Sony - too bassy; Sennheiser, good, but distorted sometimes and lacked midrange and the bass sometimes was too bassy like the Sonys; Shure SCL2s - never had enough bass and stuck out of my ears, so I couldn't put my head against a pillow or airplane seat; Shure SCL3s - better sound, slightly better bass, but still couldn't rest my head on a pillow
Enter the Shure SE215s
Very well balanced sound - I had to turn off my iPod EQ to get tonal balance (excellent sign for the headphones) and strong, but not overwhelming bass came through
midrange is also strong and the treble doesn't blow your ears away
I can finally rest my head on a pillow
They fit snugly and I think the wraparound wire makes sense and is comfortable
I can listen to these headphones for hours without discomfort and finally feel I got my bang for the buck
Now, what to do with all those other duds that came before
For the price of $99, these headphones beat out all competitions
WORTH MORE THAN $100
I fell in love with these headphones the moment I put them on
The isolation part is amazing
You hear nothing but MUSIC
I just got these in and couldn't wait to unpack them because of all the great reviews of it
I was hesitant because of the reviews that said the one ear would go out, but I love a good pair of headphones and heard these were the best bang for the buck
As an FYI, I have a pair of Klipsch S4i and Monster turbines
(not to mention my gaming headsets: Logitech g9930 and Razer carcharias
I like headphones
) So, here's the rundown:Upon receiving the package, it was pretty cheap packaging
I was hoping most of the money went into the headphones instead of the packaging
Don't get me wrong, it was in a standard carboard box with plastic to keep it in place
I guess after getting a pair of monster turbines where the packaging was amazing, I am a little spoiled
Some might say this is a crazy thing to judge about, but I know that if they care for their product, they will put care into the packaging as well
Upon opening the package, I noticed the left ear foam piece was melted and looked nothing like it was supposed to
Maybe it has been sitting in the head too much
It wasn't that big of a deal since I knew I wasn't going to use the foam tips anyway
I much prefer the rubber ones that are included with the packaging
It was a pain to get the tips off and the rubber ones weren't that great to put on either, but it wasn't incredibly difficult
Putting on the earphones did prove to be a little difficult at first trying to figure out how they are supposed to go on
Once I did, I found that these earphones provided such a tight fit I couldn't hear much around me even without any music going
For me that's a bonus, but for some they may not
It does come with a small zipper case with a metal carabiner clip on it
I guess it would help with travel when you're not listening to them
The chord is Loong
and very nice
It also comes with an earwax cleaner for your earpieces which is always nice to have
Now, the sound: these earphones sound pretty amazing
The highs are clear and crisp, the mids are okay and the bass is pretty nice
I like a lot of bass in my music with bass drops and such and this hits them with a nice punch
For the price, these headphones are better than just about anything else out there at the same pricebreak of ~$100
I would get them again if the need ever arose
Still breaking them in, but they sound pretty nice out of the box already
I had the Shure E2c for a good while and loved them
They got stolen and I found these crazy cheap
They outperform the E2c's, in my opinion, especially in the mids range
If you can find these for around $70 like I did, you can't find a better set from any other brand
Even at $99 that I frequently see there are only a 1 or 2 other choices that are comparable
Each with it's own set of strengths and weaknesses
Forget Monster beats, forget bose
This is the best i have
I have a Audio Technica ATH-ANC7B Active Noise-Cancelling headphones which i use during the winter and these headphones are way better than Audio Technica
The bass is perfect and listening dubsteps on the shure is awesome
Isolation is incredible
The only problem is getting used to putting it around your ears
Once you get it, you wont complain
i dont anymore
In short - Love em
Nice product, very good sound
The only problem is that the soft part of the ear bud doesn't quite fit my ear, so the headphones tend to fall out
I tried putting another size on and they won't go on at all
I used the tool and read and reread the instructions and I can't figure out how to get the ear pieces to fit on there
Once I finally figure it out, this product will rock my ears off
I purchased the Shure SE215-CL as a replacement for my Beats earbuds
The sound quality was quite impressive
Solid bass, good mids and highs
Unfortunately, the sound coming out of the left earbud became erratic the next day and any movement caused the sound to drop out
It was probably a defective unit, so I decided to return them
Shipping was excellent as I received them the day after I placed the order
Great Customer Service as vendor offered to replace them
I've owned the SE115's and absolutely love them
The "only" issue is that I've gone through about 3 pairs in the past 18 months due to damaging the cable, so Kevlar is a must from here on out
The sound quality between the SE115's and the SE215's is indistinguishable to me, so no issues there
The fit is entirely different though, and I have yet to find a sleeve that creates a perfect seal to get the best base response and not hurt my ears
The other potential issue is that the part of the cable near the headphone has a hard, 3 inch protective plastic cover around it, which is great for protection but means the headphone gets knocked out of place easily when the cable is touched
To sum up:Pro's: Sound quality, Kevlar, fits flat against your ears (great for listening to music while in bed)Con's: Less snug than the SE115's, protective plastic cover makes it easier to knock the headphones out of place
I would just like to say that when it comes to music sound quality, I'm spoiled
I have a sound system in my car that cost me a few K's, and as unfair as it may be, I compare all sound sources to it
Of course, one cannot expect in-ear headphones to sound exactly like a car's sound system, but one can expect for them sound a little like it
At the $150 and below price range, these are the ones
I've tried many, many in-ear headphones
Klipsch S4's, Monster Turbines, Audio Technica ATH-CKS70's and the Sony MDR-EX300's just to name a few
Let me say that each of the in-ear's just mentioned perform admirably, but, the SE215's do what all the others do well, in one package
The high's of the S4's
Check
The bass of the Turbine's and CKS70's
Check
The balanced sound of the EX300's
Check
Add to these features the replaceable cable, the perfect seal foam tips, durable construction, great looking transparent enclosure and what can I say
Ladies and gentlemen, I think I have found a keeper
Buy these
It will be the best $100 you will ever spend
For those of you still using the stock earbuds that come with portable music players, listen to the SE215's and you will never go back
These are easily the best earbuds I've ever owned, and that's listening to them before I burn them in
Let's temper that statement - I have only owned apple stock buds, a few different $15~$20 sets of earbuds, monster turbines, and these
The only real competitor here is the turbines, and surprisingly, I'd guess because of Shure's use of a dynamic driver in this model, the Shures blow the monsters away in bass punch and clarity
I have small canals, and I actually LIKE silicone inserts - the small silicone inserts fit beautifully
Depending on the shape of your ear you might have a less comfortable fit, but these buds feel like they were crafted to fit perfectly in my outer ear
The sound is great, full and rich and with a more powerful bass punch than I'd predicted
As an extra plug, SoundEarphones managed to deliver them to my door a full 2 days before the 1st expected arrival date
I'm going to start burning in these headphones tonight and plan to wear them enough to start bumping into people accidentally
Edit: Thanks to a comment from another user I changed these from 4/5 to 5/5 since I really shouldn't reserve a higher rating for a more expensive pair of earphones
These Shures are most likely the best set for this price point
1 more thing: Very glad I went with clear instead of black, they look really impressive
This review is written by a non-audiophile so a bit of a caveat first of all
I use my headphones primarily with my iphone 4
My old headphones was a Shure SE110 which I used with the MPA-3C music adaptor
The SE215 was ultimately disappointing
They do sound great
Compared to the SE110 the bass was deeper and the overall sound just seemed more clear, distinct, and richer
However there were several problems that does not make it user friendly:1)The first problem was evident immediately - the huge plug does not fit in the iphone 4 jack with the Apple Bumper on
I use the my iphone for the gym and on the subway to work so this was a huge problem right away
I had to take off the bumper to even try the headphones
Even without the bumper, the fit was awkward as the plug was L shaped so it juts out from the iphone a little making it hard to put in and out of your pocket
2) The ear piece is much more angled
I found it much harder to put in your ear and get a proper fit as you have to put it in jussst right
You have to worry about both depth and Lateral placement to get the right fit
The Shure SE110 was much easier as the total shape was similar to an ear plug and inserting the earpiece was exactly like putting in an earplug
Since the SE110 earpiece was shaped more like a pickle,  you only had to worry about depth placement
3) I had ear fatigue from the SE215 after about only 15 minutes
Never had that with the SE110
I think this is because the SE215, due to its angle, is actually touching a lot more of the ear
I did find it easier to rest my head sideways on the couch  with them on though as the SE110 jutted out of the ear too much4) The cord is really long
I mean for years Shure bragged how their cable lengths were modular so you can get the length how you want it
For some reason they turned away from this with the SE215
That makes my perfectly good MPA-3C adaptor completely unusable as a)  I then have like 9 feet of cord and b) the microphone and controls are impossibly too far away to be of any use
So if you want to control the iphone from your headphones, you have to spend another $50 for yet another music accessory,  the Shure CBL-M+K Music Phone Accessory
(Even if you don't,  you have to get it anyway or something similar if you want to use the SE215 with the iphone 4 and bumper)So very high marks for sound,  durability  (I've had them for 1 week now but they seem very high quality construction) but I wish I stuck with the SE110 or went with the SE115s instead or maybe tried a different brand entirely for use with my iphone 4
BTW,  I would shop around and do your research before buying headphones as this retailer along with others charge a 15% restocking fee,  plus you have to pay for the original "free" shipping as well as shipping back to the retailer
So these $99 headphones would have cost me $30+ to return
Instead I opted to get the mobile accessory so I ended up paying $150
Forget Dr Dre,forget klipsch,and definitely forget BOSE this is the earphone to get
This is by far one of the best $99 I ever spent on a pair of earphones
The fit is outstanding,the build quality of the SE215 is identical to Shure's $499 triple driver SE535
For $99 I challenge any one to do better than that
I highly recommend this earphones
Headphones are fantastic
I workout around 6 days/week and switched from the Power Beats by Dre, as much as I disagree with Beat's products
I liked the fact that the Power Beats were stationary, and sweat proof, as I am a heavy sweater
Initially, the SE-215's are a bit tough to break in, but once they are, the sound is fantastic
The noise cancellation feature is spot on, almost to the point of it being dangerous when I run in the city
The frequency response and power output are combined to produce some great sound
The cord is a bit bulky for a set of earphones cord, but it doesn't bother me
Shure is a great brand for audiophiles on a budget
The good: Headphones sound good for the price, and fit snug, once broken in
The bad: Mid range is a bit lacking compared to low's and high's
Also, nearly impossible to take off ear foam components
Since they are made of memory foam, when I squeeze them and try change them, I end up squeezing the foam so hard that it completely flattens out, resulting me to stop trying to pull the immobile ear bud from the headphones themselves
I like the memory foam, and the stock size is probably my size, but this is very frustrating
Deep and powerful bass, outstanding forward mid range, only bad thing is the highs tend to get rolled off though they seem to get better as you keep listening to them
If the highs are not enough for you, its nothing a little bit of EQ can fix
Like many IEM's, try driving this with an amp or just pump more volume with the device you're listening with
That's where they really shine, especially the bass
Overall, amazing sound, I just feel that the clarity of the highs could have been better
The over the ear design and may be uncomfortable for some, but soon you'll learn to appreciate the ergonomics the SE215 has to offer
They sit almost perfectly in your ear, and its design helps block outside noise, and it does so VERY well
Just make sure you got the right ear tips (These come with 3 sizes of foam, and 3 sizes of silicone rubber ear tips) to ensure maximum seal and comfort
If none of them work out, there are always alternatives like the Westone True Fit, Westone Star Tips (Which are my favourite as of now) or Comply foam tips
Bought these to replace an old set of Shure earbuds
They are more comfortable to wear, and easier to put in my ears because the tips rotate
I've been a big music lover most of my life, and this is the best experience
Hook them up to a SanDisk Clip Zip and it sounds like the orchestra is inside your head
Great for shutting out the noise when flying
I didn't expect that a set of ear buds would be able to replace my over ear noise cancelling Audiotechnica headphones
Boy was I wrong
These things sound amazing and the sound isolation is very effective
They look nice everything about them feels high quality
My biggest complaint is that I had a very difficult time figuring how to put them on
I never would have thought I would be searching Youtube for videos to find out how to put a set of ear buds in my ears but for the first few days that I had them this is what I was doing
It may take you a few tries to figure out how to get them in and sealed properly
Myself, I squish the black foam sleeves then press them into my ear, not just stick them in, actually use some force and press them in and then make a downward twist motion to settle the body into my ear
After a few seconds the foam has expanded and is blocking outside noise
Once you figure out how to insert them you will be very happy
Simply, they sound AMAZING
Most people would've heard from forums or friends that the Shure SE215 is a great pair of earphones
This statement is true
I'm no hardcore audiophile, but I really love this pair of earphones
It delivers bass really well, like, a really 'round' and punchy bass
I don't think its treble and clarity stands out from the crowd, but it still does a decent job delivering vocals and instrumental chords
I've paired it with a Hippo Cricri portable amp, and gosh does it sound great
The earphones have a lot of potential, as in, equalizing and bass boosting on your music player can be handled really well by the SE215
The only real problem I have with it is that the cables get entangled with itself real easily and it's slightly challenging to put on
Looking past these problems, the earphones are perfect for mostly anyone
For its price tag, it's a great buy, seriously
Anybody who falls into the "I just want something great without spending too much but I don't know what to buy" category, this is the earphone for you
Great sound
When my $350 monitors stopped working, I got these
These sound just as good (possibly better, but I am unable to hear both at the same time
since my other pair, which goes for $400 NOW on amazon,, STOPPED working) for a third of the price
Nice sound quality but the actual ear buds are awkward and it's hard to get them positioned in your ear properly
Bending the wire over your ear is also annoying
I had an older pair of Shure earbuds that was much better
Just put them in and go without having to fiddle with them
Great headphone for the price, I love the sound quality and durability of these
I love the the deep bass, beautiful mids, and crisp highs
Great product for the price
Sounds great
The "noise isolation" works very well by block out sounds from entering your ear
Not like the "noise cancellation" type of earphones at send a signal into your ear to counter outside noise
I use the silicone ear pieces
The set also comes with expanding foam ear pieces that work even better for noise isolation
The foam pieces are like those a construction worker or gardener (with a leaf blower) would use
You squeeze it and stuff it in your ear and it expands to fit the contours of the inside of your ear, forming a nice seal for "isolation
" They stay in the ear really well
But for me, even the smallest size started to bother me after awhile by putting excess pressure to the inside of my ear, so I'm sticking with the silicone ones
I'm happy the set came with so many options
The stethoscope effect is very minimal
The loop around the ear takes some getting used to and is a little awkward at first, but once you have it molded around your ear, it works well

Fit is very poor, continually falls out of ear
Overpriced
Not as expected
I was looking for some headphones for the gym that were a step up from the 10-15$ pairs of headphones that I usually buy, most meeting their demise by me destroying the cord
The replaceable cord was a big seller for me and this is very reasonable bang for buck option that has a replaceable cord
I've never listened to more than a 10-15$ pair of in ear monitors prior to this purchase
I'm floored by the sound
Even my wife who claims she can never hear the difference between any speakers that I have auditioned in the house or in a car commented how good they were
Pros:Sound quality is terrific with very crisp highs and very clear, if a little shallow, bassThe cable is detachable
In my experience, the ear buds will last well beyond the life of the cablesWide variety of ear tips made finding a tight seal very easyGreat passive noise cancellation (If you find the right ear tip)No sound leak at all
Crank these bad lads up without annoying those around youCons:Does not play well with moisture
I wouldn't suggest working out (I broke a pair after about a month at the gym)Some may find the over-ear cable design to be a tad wonkyCable lacks remote (In-line remote cables are available though)Summary:I have owned earbuds from Beats, Bose, Etymotic, Klipsch, Monster, etc
The SE215's are my favorite buds of all time, and the last pair that came close in terms of sound quality and durability were the Shure SE210's
While the sound recreation is stellar on the mids and highs, heavy-bass lovers may find the 215's to be lackluster
Do yourself a favor, end the search, and just get a pair of these
I will start off by saying im not an audiophile
This is my 2nd pair of "nice" headphones
Ok on to the good parts about it
They have GREAT isolation
Almost too much haha
The sound quality is nice and clear
Dont know how to explain it very well but it was very flat
The bad
I bought these for use in school or while doing homework thinking that itd help me concentrate
However i could not get past the how uncomfortable they are
Im not a picky person and thought they wouldnt be that annoying but i was wrong
Its very difficult to put on and by the time you get it in, it has already began to irratate you so you yank them out
The swivel connection was extremely loose and would just slide around while trying to put on
Cord is very annoying and heavy
These are for performing musicians, not for the average person that wants good isolation
I made that mistake thinking theyd be ok for my day to day life
Overall very difficult to use and only mehh sound
Not for the average joe
amazing sound
after a while you have to wiggle or wrap the cords a certain way to get the sound to come out of both (and not just one) of the headphones
Had this happen in other Shures too
Right earphone lost sound after 3 or 4 times use after I received the order within 1 month
Definitely defective batch maybe that is why there is the discount
Don't buy
Dont waste your money
I bought them thinking they would at least last a year based on their price
after less than a month of use the input plug doesn't work like any other cheap earphones out there
The earphones I had before this where 15 $ skullcandys which lasted 3 moths
You do the math
Sound is ok, for the price, quality of material used is good
Difficult to insert compared to my old Shure, and the wire is way too long, uncomfortable to wear overall
The best
Sound is incredible
Good bass, all other levels are very clear
Took practice to get comfortable in my ear and fit is snug
Kinda weird getting use to them but good sound
Makes for awkward encounters because you really can't hear anything that is going on in the real world when you are wearing these
I've been wearing them in cafes while I study and don't want to be distracted and I can't hear what is going on around me
I've been wearing them in the gym on the rowing machine and stay on better than any other ear phone I've ever tried - these are NOT falling out when you work out
The sound isolation is probably really good for my ears too: because they do such a great job of blocking the sound around me I can keep the volume of my music really low
Used to be I'd have to crank up my music or language tapes when riding the subway, now I keep it at a normal level and I'm probably doing less damage to my ears
The nylon carrying case is the perfect size too
I Love them
they are awesome
Good sound
Awesome quality
Fair price
I have had these headphones for about 2 months
While the sound is one of the best I've ever gotten from these types of headphones, one of the earbuds died on me
This probably happened due to having them coiled in my pocket, stretching possibly etc
If you do consider buying this; make sure you treat them with care, just because they're expensive doesn't mean they're invincible, and I would strongly recommend buying from the website so you can get insurance (if that's a thing for these)
Sound is good
But you have to pick the flexible bud that fits your ear to get the best effect
The bass is good as the highs
The complaints I read about adapting the buds around the ear is not as bad as mentioned
I fly a lot and have to place them on my ears often
After the third adjustment I know exactly how to use them without difficulty
Its really simple
The cord is a little long but better long than short
I like the cord
Of five different buds I own these are the best
As a drummer, I was looking for an affordable quality transition from over ears to in ears for work in the studio and live
I would highly recommend this to any drummer on a budget looking to make the switch
Until we allow babies to be shipped via FedEx to their final destination as opposed to riding on an airplane, I'm going to be using these to block out their piercing screams
First pair of headphones that haven't been the stock kind from apple or samsung
I love them, they block out 98% of sound and has great audio quality
just opened them, and they've managed to make a great replacement for some old E2Cs (which I love but really don't fit my tiny ears properly, they fall out even with the smallest sleeves), more recently followed by 2 broken pairs (Ultimate Ears and Klipsch)
I won't stray from Shure again, sound quality is top notch and all the areas where my previous 2 pairs have broken (wire broke away at the jack connector) are reinforced and seemingly durable
Did I mention the sound quality is top notch
I can't wait to drown out the NYC subway sounds during my commute with crystal-clear and deep sound
I bought these recently as part of a serious effort to find earbuds that deliver quality sound, secure fit, and affordable enough that I wouldn't be distraught if I lost them
These fit the bill perfectly
I used to own a pair of the previous-generation Bose in-ear phones
Really great sound, but they never sat very securely in my ears
I see that they have recently modified the ear attach point, but I was skeptical nonetheless
I tried these because of great reviews and the fact that I was able to purchase them at slight discount
The result is that I am extremely satisfied
So satisfied, that I am seriously considering purchasing on of the dual-driver models to get the sound to the next level
But these are more than adequate for daily use
Sound is balanced and clean
Not bass-biased like some more popular name brands
The younger me would have chased that bass sound, but the more even balance of these headphones are much better
Also, crucially, the fit is extremely secure without being uncomfortable
Most other earbuds I've tried are not well suited to normal movement
These can handle a great deal of head movement without requiring readjustment
These earbuds have made me a believer and I will definitely buy from Shure again
Great buy
Love these
I am a nervous flier, and flew by myself for the first time in 2011
I was at an airport kiosk and looking for a pair of earplugs in my time to kill
I came across these, and at first balked at the price
"$100 for a pair of headphones
" I remember saying
The guy at the counter was quick to point out these are "In Ear Monitors", and vastly superior to "headphones"
I was skeptical, but wanted something to keep the sound of an airplane engine out of my eardrums, and figured I'd treat myself
Boy am I glad I did
With music playing, I didn't have to hear the stewardesses give their stupid "put on your seat belt" speech, wasn't bothered by the babies and children on the flight, didn't really notice the engine except for the vibrations (not at all Shure's fault, I'm the idiot putting my life in the pilot/air company's hands
) and I can honestly say the sound is in a whole other class above what I'd heard before
I'm by no means an audiophile, but I am a Computer Engineer, and I feel at this point, these babies are no longer the cause of any of my gripes about sound quality
I find myself seeking out lower compression/higher bit-rate music as I'm now listening on something that you can actually hear the difference between the upper-bit-rate mp3's and "lossless" audio encodings
I use them every day in my cubicle at work, and everyone within earshot is so glad I replaced my old, open air Sony wraparounds
No sound gets in or out, so everyone is happy
I've run over 10 miles on a trail with them and they stand up well
I always use the foam tips as opposed to the rubber ones that also come with them, and have ordered a pack of replacement mid sized ones
To me they seem to last about a year before you need new foam tips, which is not bad considering a pack of 6 is about $20 or so
All in all, can't recommend them enough, and these are the "entry level" Shure's
Can't wait till I hit the lottery and can justify getting the $1000 ones
Then again, I'll need to use them in a recording studio or something, because where else are you going to get truly lossless quality sound
Combined with the Tripe Flange Sleeves (not included
WHY
) I FINALLY have a way to enjoy music, audiobooks and podcasts while riding my motorcycle
These do a great job of blocking most of the wind noise I experience inside my helmet without needing high-cost, battery powered noise-cancellation provided by other manufacturer's headsets
They also do a GREAT job of blocking background chatter of colleagues in open-plan offices ;)
Somewhat upped cymbals around 2-4khz band but not irritating
The rest is pretty good including the bass response where some might be wondering
Very clear sound but people looking for a good sound stage and neutral sound should better look at something else
The detachable cable is not as great as I expected since you need to use the same special cable from Shure but it is indeed a relief in case you frequently get your cord damaged like my brother
Putting them onto your ears is a challenge at first few times but you get used to it and the plugs are quite great
Absolutely love them
works very well - a noticeable improvement in design from the last set that I bought in 2008 (the old version's cables are cracked up and there was no way to replace the cables so i like the new design of replacement cords)
These are my first IEMs and I couldn't be happier with them even if I don't have anything else to compare them to
I'm a drummer, and whether it's live applications, or practicing to a metronome or music, these things protect my hearing while blocking out enough sound from my kit so I can hear the audio from the earphones clearly, but not so much as to block out my kit altogether
The bass is perfect in live applications, I can hear my bass drum and bass guitar very clearly
If you plan on using these for regular music/movie listening, mids and highs are very clear as well
It took me a few tries when I got them to put the foam tips in my ears but once I got the hang of it, It's been nothing but a great listening experience ever since and I feel better knowing my hearing is protected with these
I absolutely love these
I'm a drummer and I am not a big fan of floor wedges so in ears were a must
They have great sound quality and the right amount of bass
I've heard things that I have never heard before on stage
These are a great piece of equipment definitely a must buy
I've had these earphones for almost 2 years now and hardly a day goes by where I don't use them
I've used them everywhere: on the plane, on the bus, in the car, on the subway, while walking to classes, and so on
The sound isolation on these earphones is excellent and ensures they can be used in pretty much any setting
Cable noise (microphonics) also isn't an issue
I'm not going to comment on the sound signature because 1) I find from my ventures on head-fi that it just leads to increasingly pretentious and empty-sounding adjectives (cold, analytical, warm, fun, juicy
), 2) I use these IEMs frequently in noisy environments (which is the whole point of getting an IEM right
if I didn't need the isolation i'd just walk around with my headphones) and 3) I believe that it's the job of the artist, not the headphone, to make the music sound good (I listen to classical music)
For me the ideal earphone would be an exact replicate of what one hears in real life (I think audiophiles would call this "neutral")
What I will say is that I also own a pair of Shure SRH840 full-size headphones, and that music from my headphones and IEMs sound pretty much the same except of course with a smaller soundstage on the IEMs
In other words, I've never had any complaints about the sound quality of these earphones, and I think they offer at least excellent value, maybe even the best, for their price
My one complaint is that after owning these earphones for about 2 years, sometimes the music doesn't come out properly from the left earbud and one has to give the cable a twist or two to get it to work
I've owned my Shure SRH840 headphones for 3 years and they have a similar problem, the music doesn't come out properly focused sometimes and one has to adjust the plug until it does
So I think this might be a cable problem with Shure products in general and I'd be curious to know if others have had this problem
In short these earphones offer excellent sound quality and isolation, but after a few years you may find that they don't work as perfectly as hoped, which is a little disappointing considering they do cost a nontrivial amount of money
If I were to buy a new pair of IEMs today, I'd take a really good look around and see if I can't do better than the Shure SE215, but even if you can't, it's not the end of the world by any means
I have owned several headphones and earbuds over the last decade and have owned the Shure SE425, Shure SE315 and Shure SE215
I have also owned Sennheiser and Klipsch to name a few
Sadly, my SE425 ( a gift from my family) was stepped on and crushed accidently (bad day there) and I can't afford to replace that
I play the bass guitar and upright and use my SE315 when I sometimes asked to sit in at church (far cry from college band days in 80's)I would say I am probably like most everyone - I want a great set of earbuds that give me the best listening experience AND I don't want spend $100 and wonder if I paid too much or could have spent less
The SE215s are, in my opinion, the best cost to quality ratio of any earbud I have owned
FULL range of sound, mids are good and low end is great
The SE215 is versatile and will accommodate any music style or genre you enjoy
YOU MUST BURN THEM IN by just playing 20 hours or more of music (I just turn them up to 60% on my IPhone/Ipod and stick earbuds under a pillow)
They sound great out of the box, but IF you do buy a really good set of earbuds they get better with use
IMPROVEMENTS: Shure has improved the one issue I did have with the earlier model SE115 which was the wire connection to the buds themselves
That thick cone shaped connector at the earbud itself is an actual connector allowing you to replace the wire OR ADD the MICROPHONE/CONTROL cable
I bought my daughter these earbuds and the jack got bent and just replaced the wire
Bottom line is the Shure SE215 is designed, professional audio equipment at a bargain price and If you can go a few extra bucks and want a set of earbuds that sound like $300 earbuds then the SE215 is a worthy investment
The Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones are good in-ear headphones
After some tweaking of the wires and understanding how they best fit in my ears, they performed really well
I recently traveled via the train and these headphones cut out all the noise of the train and most conversations surrounding me
These headphones are best used while looping over the year and they fit snug in the ear cavity much like professional in-ear monitor headphones used by professional singers without the multi-thousand dollar price tag
The headphones have a great sound and deliver a beautiful and dynamic range within your ears
The bass is measured appropriately in comparison to the mid and high ranges
The words of your music cut through music with clarity and give the customer a great listening experience
These in-ear monitors do have a little learning curve to them since they sit more into the ear cavity then other headphones, but if you want a great listening experience and can afford the price tag then you should consider the Shure SE215-K Live Sound Monitor headphones
I love these things
They really block out the sound even at a fairly low volume
I think the sound quality is very good, but you may have to EQ the things to your taste
Great sound
Bought these as a replacement for a pair of Klipsch X10s that had their flimsy cable die just out of warranty
Got sick of replacing expensive IEMs over this issue
The Shure line is the only remotely affordable option with removable cables, and they're not bad at all aurally - but there are some immediately obvious drawbacks
Pros:Superb sound isolation and secure fit makes them ideal for commutingWith a proper seal, they sound great for the price - nice bass that doesn't overpowerRemovable, thick cableCons:Awkward insertion processThe monitors themselves are large enough to feel uncomfortable in the ear after several hoursQA issues - had to send back a pair due to (apparently common) issues with sound dropping on the left ear
Fat plug won't fit most phone cases
my absolute favorite before I got a custom in-ears, highly recommended if you want seriously awesome sounds in an earphones but can't afford a custom fit in-ears, yet - or you can just save up and get the custom in-ears right away… BUY THIS
Great equipment
Couldn't be happier with them
works very well - a noticeable improvement in design from the last set that I bought in 2008 (the old version's cables are cracked up and there was no way to replace the cables so i like the new design of replacement cords)
I must say this model has been doing pretty well in terms on sound quality so far
The only problem I have with it is it's kinda hard to take out the ear buds to change them
It's good in the sense they don't fall off easily, but bad in the sense it's too good that I couldn't take it out==
I had to write a review after reading all these morons using these for walking,biking etc
THESE ARE FOR MUSICIANS AND PERFORMERS FOR LIVE SETTINGS
THESE ARE MEANT TO BLOCK OUT LOUD SOUNDS AND ISOLATE WHAT YOURE HEARING IN YOUR EARS
Duh
And if you cry babies have a problem they come with different size ear buds for a reason
Okay now thats off my chest, I am a touring/studio drummer and I always used the Shure E2's
they don't make them anymore, I was worried about the price of these, I believe you get what you pay for
I am BEYOND AMAZED by these and I will buy these again
I play to a click track live and wanted something THAT BLOCKED OUT NOISE AROUND ME AND THATS WHAT THESE ARE FOR
To you people who jog,walk,bike or whatever with any kind of earbuds or headphones you're a moron and deserve to get ran over by a bus
Use common sense
I HIGHLY recommend these AS A MUSICIAN AND PERFORMER
after all thats what they are made for
I just want to start with saying that while these In-ear-monitors (IEM) will function as regular headphones with phenomenal sound, be aware of what you are buying
these are not IEMs designed for runners, bikers, or for anyone really where noise cancellation is dangerous, they are designed to be used as IEMs for performers where external noise can be distracting or cause you to lose important information that you need to be hearing
I myself am a bass player and I need IEMs that will stay in my ear, provide great low-end, and have extreme clarity, and these are absolutely perfect for me
These things sound phenomenal, are rugged enough to withstand a fair bit of abuse that comes with playing live music (I myself am a fairly animated musician), and they stay in your ear
The sound isolating is fantastic
the mix stays in my ears without all of the distraction and muddiness of the live audio blasting and reverberating throughout the room dirtying up the sound
For any musician who is running IEMs and doesn't want to spend a fortune of higher end IEMs from companies like Alien Ears, Westone, etc
, the Shure SE215 does a stellar job for a great price
I would never recommend trying to get by with standard headphones, while they get the job done they don't do the job near as well as these IEMs
Again, just be aware that these are not designed to function like your standard earbuds and may not the best option for runners, bikers etc
The sound is great for what you're paying, actually these should cost more with the audio quality they deliver
Unfortunately I had to return these for two reasons:1) I could not get over how uncomfortable these were
I have pretty sensitive ears and the wrap around cord was a constant nusance and just felt uncomfortable
2) this next reason is my fault, but I wasn't looking for earphones which block out all noise, which is something these earphones do well
I couldn't hear any outside noise, this making me feel uncomfortable when walking in public
Very Good
They're amazing, They do there job
I was going to give 5 stars, but after riding for awhile with these, I noticed that my ears were getting more and more sore
The fitting molds are great, and they do fit relatively well (not like customs, but hey, these aren't custom), but because they are hard plastic, they wear on my cartilage in my ears
If you have pimple in your ear (gasp
), they are unwearable
I do love the sound and the loudness, and the cable length is good, too
The perfect IEM for the novice
very sturdy construction and flex ear buds are best I've used
Design of the ear piece takes a bit getting used to, but snug once adjusted
As a drummer, I was looking for an affordable quality transition from over ears to in ears for work in the studio and live
I would highly recommend this to any drummer on a budget looking to make the switch
awesome deal
If you like clarity or depth to your music
Dont get these
Great bass though
after using it for over a month i have 1 huge issue with my earphonemy left earpiece makes annoying metal
clicking sound whenever i move the wire
i am going to contact shure to see if i can have it fixed or replaced-editi figured out the issue, the left earpiece's socket is loose, so it vibrates whenever i move or tap it (causing the metal clicking and *ting ting* sound i am very disappointed, i am still waiting for customer support to answer me back
Pros: These make the world around you silent
I went from Beats Studio's with active noise cancellation to these and the difference is dramatic
Sound quality is great
Cons: They hurt my ears when I first put them in, but I got used to putting them in and taking them out
Great product
these are great
if you get sweat into them, the contacts tarnish
take them apart and spritz a little contact cleaner into them and they're good as new
i use them on stage all the time and they work flawlessly
sure beats spending $500 on custom molded
Summary: Fantastic, balanced and clear sound
Tight, comfortable fit
Breakaway cord means you can replace the wire without replacing the whole thing
Sound: In a nutshell, this are very clear, accurate earbuds that let you hear every detail of your music
They are so clear, you may find yourself upping the bitrate on your music to hear every last detail
Bass: Clean, natural, accurate reproduction
Not a bass-heavy version, so if you like bumping bass for your hip hop, could be the wrong thing
Still has present bass, just not artificially boosted
Mids: Very clear and accurate sounding
Highs: The highs are a little more pronounced on these than some others, giving nice hi hats and upper vocal definition
To call these perfectly in balance, I would probably turn down the treble by 5% and give it to the 3% to the mids and 2% to the bass, and that's probably what you get when you upgrade to the next level
But overall very very solid
Fit is tight without hurting your ears
The Shure wraparound design means the cord isn't always trying to pull the earbuds out of your ears, so you can have a tighter fit without being so tight your ears start to hurt after a while
In past models, this meant that if you jerked on your cord or dropped your phone the wire might get stretched or even break, because they don't come out of the ear easily
I had to replace them twice, and finally gave up and went to something else
I'm pleased to see they addressed that problem with a breakaway cord that disconnects from the more expensive hardware
I assume this means cheap and easy replacement of only the wire
To Shure's credit, in the last model before they added the breakaway, they shipped me new ones completely free of charge twice
So I trust this company
Plus, I've listened to lots of $100 headphones and these are by far my favorite
Most headphones jack the bass or lack that sonic sound even if they're clear
These are genuine hifi earbuds
Sound is defintiely good, no complaints in that department
However, these are probably the most uncomfortable feeling headphones i have ever used
I have tried using all different sizes of the foam and rubber earbuds that are provided, and none stay in the ear and just feel very intrusive
Very nice product, happy with the purchase
The sound quality is very good, much better than the previous earphones I had
The earbuds fit very well and the foam fit does a quality job of outside noise cancellation (I can hardly hear anything over the music at very low levels)
Wrapping the cord over and behind the ear was a new concept for me and a little strange to put in at first, but feel much more securely set
Note, longer hair hanging over your ears can be a frustrating to put in if you are not used to this style
They're great and fit very well
The cable is extremely long and it doesn't come with some sort of cable management
Sony ships theirs with a little wraparound thing and MeElectronics ships theirs with an actual clip
Considering how long the cable is, it would be nice if it came with something to handle it (Seriously, I'm 5'8" and the cable is almost as long as I am tall)
These are fantastic
I use them when riding my motorcycle and the sound is great and the fit is great, considering my full-face helmet slips on over them in my ears
They stay in place and they don't hurt even after hundreds of miles of riding
Clear sound; replaceable wires
I use 'em at the gym, where the abuse is hard on the wires; the wires aren't all that cheap, but cheaper than buying a new set of not-so-good in-ear monitors
What can I say
It's my second pair of mid fi products and I love it
These IEMs are a solid choice for somebody getting into higher audio
If you want something that is more "fun", this is for you
It has a really strong impacting bass that is accurate as well
The mids are fine, nothing special but there isn't much range on the treble and isn't as great there
Its a comfortable pair of IEM's to me, however some people may not enjoy the over design of the earbuds
For anybody wondering, they work fine with glasses as well
I would highly recommend these for anybody looking at a $100 purchase
I love this earphone
Isolation is very good and the sound is great
A good bonus is that the cable is quite sturdy compared to other in-ear headphones
I've been using it for over a years and the cable has no signs of tears
These are a stellar set of headphones
I use these as monitors when I play drums for my church and in my band
They can get LOUD with no loss of sound quality at all
The sound isolation is great thanks to the foam tips and the quality and clarity from the drivers is phenomenal
Please note that if you are into the bigg booming bass and "loudness" feel to your music, these are not the headphones for you
These are for accurately portraying the sound that an artist is meaning to show you
Every high and low is there but not overpowering like what you get from the BEATS by Dre headphones (which are total garbage)
If you do want to have a heavier bass response then I would suggest a set of SOL headphones
They are excellent quality and relatively inexpensive as far as higher-end headphones go
Picked up the SE215s to replace Bose Noise Canceling over ear headphones
I was tired of the Noise Canceling hiss and was tough to sleep on a plane with huge headphones
These have proven to be a great alternative and couldn't be happier
Some people complain in-ear headphones can hurt after a while, but honestly, I have no issues
From rock to hip-hop, to classical to the Grateful Dead these are far and away my favorite purchase in a long time
They're small, pack in a nice little case and take up a 1/10th of the room in my carry-on as the Bose
Took a little time to get used to putting them on, but the noise isolating is awesome and the hiss is gone -I'm sure there are a lot of audiophiles out there that will find something wrong with anything, but I can say they are a great sounding set of monitors and am really happy with the purchase
Great build quality, strong cable and nice sound
For $100 they're a great option
And if I accidentally leave them on the plane I can buy 2 more pair before I get to the price of the Bose
way too complicated to put on
wire and ear piece a nuisance
This is my second pair of Shure earphones of this stile
My first pair was the older design where the cable was not replaceable, which I tore when I snagged them while doing yard work
These headphones are great for tuning out the world without ruining your hearing
Since they work much like shooting year plugs you do not have to turn the volume up louder than your surrounding noise in order to hear your music, which in the long run will prevent you from doing damage to your hearing
I wear them while mowing or while traveling on trains or subways and it is like creating a privacy bubble around myself so I can tune out the noisy passengers without being a nuisance since no one can hear my earphones
The sound quality is great  as well and they sit well with the wire around my ears
The chord is long enough that I can put my iPhone in my back pocket while wearing the headphones
I would definitely recommend these headphones
Im not a audiophile, so I wont say much about the sound quality
The vocal is pretty clean
The build quality is really excellent
Its comfortable, but the stock ear tips are not really good for long hour use
(I'd suggest getting the comply foam tips)
they sound great and block out the noise
I purchased these for use as backup in-ear monitors for live stage performance, and for the price on Amazon, they were a bargain compared to other pro monitors (like my Westone Elites)
I play a variety of instruments, some of which require precise sound reproduction as well as isolating the rather loud on-stage wedges
Hearing a clear mix is critical, and I just needed inexpensive backups, so I wasn't counting on these meeting these lofty requirements
These are nice earphones, and I now use them as my go-to in-ears
I even bought another pair for yard work and other activities where sound protection is needed
I've had no quality problems after a few months of heavy use
These are well-made earphones using durable materials
The soft, moldable cable sleeves are designed to wrap around your ears, providing a comfortable, secure fit
These also have a cable "cinch" that can make the cables cling to the back of your head which helps prevent snagging
Unfortunately, I have to re-tighten it after an hour or so of playing
The driver housing's swivel design helps fit your outer ear better
Choose the size of the squishy ear buds correctly (included) and you won't know they're there after a while
They do have a slight low-end punch that tends to emphasize sounds around 100 Hz (like kick drums), but it is not annoying
(Sometimes you can play with positioning in the ear canal to adjust bass punch
)Over the years, I have collected a handful of favorite headphones (SONY MDRV55s, Sennheiser HDs, Bose Quiet Comfort for noise-cancelling), and while the Sure SE215s do not match the stratospheric audiophile quality of my favorites, they perform exceptionally well on-stage or when active and needing noise isolation
The SE215s were apparently just the ticket for her
She mostly listens to dubstep and other bass-heavy music
The Se215s are often mentioned as particularly good for dubstep and electronica, and se seems extremely happy with them
Another thing she appreciates is the good selection of extras they come with
Excellent for the price, would buy again
In fact I did, as my daughter lost the first set through a freak accident :(
I truly love these earphones
Sound quality is great
I previously owned some Nergy earphones and no comparison
However, the over-the-ear thing does take some time to get used to, but not a huge problem
Wow
it is a excellent in-ear earphone with respect to the price
Sound quality is very high
Specially BASS and TREBLES are great
Another thing, the background noise sounds are almost blocked by the earphone body
It is great look and the connection code is very long
The only problem is There is no Volume Control with this
It should be additionally purchase
I have already written a book  about the "Everything About Earphones" and I studied almost 100 earphones for that with various brands the cost below US $ 300 earphones
This is one of the best earphone that I studied so far, others are BOSE QC 20i, Yamaha EPH100,
Anyway I strongly recommended this to others
I am planning to buy a High End Shure Earphone (That is Either Shure SE - 535 or Shure SE - 846), because It has a 3 or 4 drivers with balanced armature technique
The price of Shure SE - 535 is not so bad, but Shure SE - 846 is very very expensive than 3 drivers one
Great beginning in-ears
Good sound quality
Only reason its not a five star rating is that they will occasionally slip out of your ear when performing
If you're looking for elite sound quality, dish out more money, these are not for you
Great sound, perfect fit and fits flat against my ear
I have used them for 100's or hours biking as they cut wind noise and replace it with tunes
Would buy again if I lost them
I spent a few days researching what earbuds to get and eventually decided on the Shure SE215
After receiving them and using them for a day I'm returning them the next
I would only recommend these headphones if you're a single use person
If you're plugging them into one device and one device only and not transporting them around
The sound quality is quite good but other than that everything else about these are very poor
They do have a lot more bass however than the comparable BOSE earbuds
The style of these are extremely outdated
You can feel it from the cord, see it by the length and the plug is designed to go right into the input
If you have a case on your iPhone or other unit, you won't be able to use the SHURE headphones with it
So again if you're single use like the laptop, then it's probably okay
The earbuds are extremely difficult to take off and change out, while also being awkward to put on
I had to give these a one-star because after I took my case off of my phone to use them at the gym, sound wouldn't come out of both earbuds only one
If the plug was turned just the right direction it would come out of both, but this is difficult to do
Returning them after one day of use
For it's price, the bass is powerful and tight but not overwhelming
The Mids are decent although not as warm as I would like
The lows are decent and the highs are very clear
Overall, the best $120 I spent on earphones
It competes well with earphones twice the price but wearing them takes some getting used to
I bought these looking for a new pair of IEM's (in-ear monitor) and I found the perfect ones
I can't quite afford brand such as Ultimate Ears (starting at $300 for a decent pair) or JH Audio (starting at $400) but these are on par
The sound quality is better than my Bose earphones and they fit better too
They have no business sounding this good for the price
I wanted something that fit perfectly and were hard to see on stage
I bought the I-MEGO Ztone at the same time because I liked the design, but the sound wasn't even close to comparable
These should cost $250-$300 but for only $97 they are fantastic
Pros: Crystal clear perfect sound, fit is great, moldable ear hooks, interchangeable ear insert, removable cable (allowing for longer life), compares to IEM's costing hundreds more, perfect mix of bass mid and high
Cons: Only two choice's of colors (I would've loved gold) ear pieces are tough to get off
UPDATE: After I bought the IEM's, I found out my entire band for church uses these earphones
No one had complaints
Everyone loved the sound, feel, and especially the quality for the money

Have owned 2 pairs of ec3's in the past and they were phenomenal
First day of use with these 215's and when you twist the headphone jack or move the cord in anyway sound cuts out of left ear
Apparently it's a common problem, so I will return and go with a brand that has better quality control
I was hoping to score big with this birthday present for my husband
Unfortunately that did not happen
He really tried to act excited and grateful but they were uncomfortable in his ears
I did return them and had no problem with the return of refund
So there was a positive to the experience
May work well for others but not for my hubby
Received these Sure SE215-K headphones on May 20th
Precisely 7 days after the `return window' expired (30 days) these $100 headphones crapped out on me
I was so pleased to finally find a pair of headphones that sounded great and fit snugly
Then, the first time I put them in after returning from a trip abroad, the sound is horrible
The bass has completely dropped out and everything sounds muddy
What a waste
Totally disappointed
I'll be contacting both the seller Rock-Rock and Amazon and Shure if need be to see if they can find it in their hearts to offer a refund for these faulty headphones
I shall return with an update
UPDATE - Amazon customer service did the right thing and sent along a return label
I bought what I thought to be a nice set of EIM for a 2 month trip through Asia as I wanted something more compact than my over ear noise cancelling headphones
These headphones had problems almost immediately
They are quite comfortable and do a good job blocking out sound but they hardly ever work
Sound only comes from 1 ear the majority of the time and I have to fiddle with the cords to try to make the other ear work
Hoping this is an isolated issue and Shure will be willing to replace them once I return from my trip
For now I am stuck with some crappy headphones for a rather hefty price though
Sounds great for a very basic pair, ver much value for money
After one month of heavy use I dont regret getting this headphones
I use them to run and they can stand sweat
The sound isolating qualities are exactly what is advertised
DO NOT DRIVE WITH THESE IN
You wont hear anything
Base response is warm and natural sounding but not strong enough to wash out low mids
Mids are a little muddy in my opinion but i think it is because the treble response is soft
Overall I use these for IEM's and they are a great tool to keep track of what I'm doing on stage
And they dont stick out like ultimate ears
They sit in your ear canal and partially fill the cavity that surround the opening to your ear canal before looping over and behind your earlobe
I bought these headphones for the purported sound quality, which is fantastic, but what really gives it that fifth star is the noise-cancelling capacity
I've used Bose QC15's and noise-cancelling earphones before but this really comes close to the same level as IEM's with regard to blocking out external sound
The seemingly foam earpieces fill every crevice in your ear so that I can't hear myself clap right next to myself
Quite impressive
For an inexpensive noise isolating in ear monitor these things rock
The noise isolation works so good Ive caught myself yelling while talking to others when no music is being played
When I was looking at these headphones, I was hoping that they would block enough noise to allow me to use them while drumming
I could not find that information in any review on the internet
To any drummers looking at these, they do cut the drum noise down to a level where you will not injure your ears or drown out the music you are listening to
On top of that you don't have to blast your music to get this
When I am listening to something while playing, I still only have to put the music at a very low volume
Also, I play with these in even if I am not listening to anything, using them simply to cut the drum noise
Basically, they work great for me as a drummer
The end
I unboxed these earphones not twenty minutes ago and was greeted by sound dropouts from broken connections in the cable, which is super frustrating because when they work properly with some persuasion they sound great for $99
So excellent earbuds, but even though cables are a problem for all headsets it's a real pain to have to ship back the whole kit straight out of the box, especially as it's a detachable cable
These are extremely well designed IEMs with an excellent design with the exception of one design flaw
I'm very hard and headphones and though I liked the Klipsch S4s, I was going through a new pair every 3 months
The cable connection to the earpieces kept going bad
So the detachable cables on these IEMs sold me
The cables are extremely durable and thick, and detach through a unique swiveling connection to the earpieces
I got quickly used to over-the-ear style which also takes some the strain off of the cable
Sound quality: Very very good for $100
These take ~50 hours of breaking in, but after that providevery solid bass and clear albeit slightly rolled-off highs
Compared to the Klipsch S4s, they are more balanced across the entire range
Overall, not quite as much bass punch as the S4s but more neutral mids and highs
The one design flaw: The plastic posts that hold the earbuds on are longer than average, which helps hold the inserts on with more force
Unfortunately, the plastic posts will also easily break if you happen to step on the earpieces
After 3 months, both are broken and the IEMs are unusable
The wires on these are tarrible they started shorting out after two months
Sound quality is great but they need better wires
These sounded great during the first use
But when I tried to change the earphone tip, the plastic post snapped
This was on the first night of ownership
I ended up returning them and going with a different brand that uses a metal post
If you're going for noise isolation, these are by far the best headphones in the $100 range
After going through a pair of Beats Solo, Bose MEI2I - or close to that model, and another pair of Klipschs I found the Shures to be outstanding in the sound quality and isolation traits
A few notes below
PROS• Complete noise isolation
Really, you can't hear anything if you have them in and 25% volume on your phone or computer• Cable is long and can easily reach wherever you have your computer/laptop/phone/etc• Cable can be routed behind head and there is a slider that will hold the headphones tight to your ears• 3 different tips shipped with headphones for personal fit• Extremely durable cord that can be replaced, swapped for different color separate from the ear pieceCONS• After wearing them for 6-8 hours, your ears will get tired
I've never encountered a pair of in ear headphones where this wasn't the case
I have read about these being poor fitting but never imagined it could be this bad
Acoustically excellent but frustrating in keeping them on
Yes, they're big in the ear
You can't lie down on a pillow with them, they're just to painful
Sound quality would be that of a $30 pair of earbuds
Not worth the price at all
No need to elaborate, if you're looking for an upgrade to high quality earphones, these would be ones to avoid
I made a decision to purchase these Shure SE215 headphones based on all the positive reviews here
The issues I have experienced are:I can't get a proper fit with the foam buds - I can get them on in such a manner that the sound is good, but if I turn my head one, or both may fall out
Sound quality, especially bass,is very diminished if not worn perfectly
Sound quality - These are definitely studio monitor headphones
Different audio sources and recordings sound as perfect or imperfect as they were engineered
Not a bad thing, but I'd rather just enjoy the music and not think, wow that sound guy must have been half deaf when he mixed that
Bass - I found the opposite of some reviewers
I thought bass was a little light, even slightly de-emphasized
I spent half my flight the other day fiddling around with these buds
People behind me probably thought I had lice or something
I much prefer the overall sound and ease of use of my $8 Sony EX10 buds than these
Just ordered another pair
Used them for recording and they work great for a nice balance of your drums and the click track
Used them with rehearsing live and was getting too much noise from the guitars and bass so I couldn't hear the click track very well
Again these are perfect for recording drums but not good for all the extra noise that comes from the guitars and bass in rehearsing situations
Clear highs, steady mids, deep lows
Wearing them was the biggest issue I had initially however once you get the idea of how they are supposed to go in your ear it is cake
Just look at a picture online if you're having issues
I also go by the logo on the side of the monitor it should always be readable to someone looking at it
Comes with a wide variety of tips however the memory foam ones that are preinstalled are far superior to the others so I put them back on
5 stars will buy again if i happen to smash these in my day to day
Only reason I wouldn't get these is if I had some extra cash and decided get an upgrade to something custom molded to my ear canal
I've had 500's but destroyed them on a bike ride, cord got tangled in my wheel & ripped the cord
Well that shouldn't happen with these
sound's not bad, fit is solid Shure
Best isolation there is, decent bass, clear mids
I tired the cable with the mic, but didn't see the advantage of $50 just to have a mic
I just speak into the phone
the only thing is they are expensive for what they are
headphones
He likes the dynamic range of the ear buds and the way they have some noise canceling abilities
The ear buds work with his ear good too
For the money you would be hard pressed to get a better sound
I love these phones
On a bus or plane all you hear is what is on your player
The bad point is walking the street an not hearing warning sounds around you
Items just as described, shipping was nice and fast as well
They can get some getting use to, but once you find the best fit they are worlds ahead of the competition out there
I'm a drummer and I bought these to replace my E2Cs, which lasted a LOT longer
I play with an Aviom personal monitor system and play to backing tracks (accompanying keys, extra guitars, etc
) with a click track and guide voice (to que chorus, verse, etc)
One day, the person programming the guide wave made it a little too loud and blew my left ear bud
The right still works fine, so I can't say that it was THAT loud, but since that day, the left side no longer works
I know this because I switched the left and right buds, and the right works on either side, the left bud does not
It started with just static in my left ear and now it's completely silent
This is after 4-5 months of use, much heavier use in the latter 2-3 months
I went on line to see if I can get a replacement ear bud, and while there's PLENTY of ear tips to go around, there's no replacement buds
So don't be fooled by reviews that state "easy replacement" with detachable buds
they're not exactly that easy to find
Shure's website doesn't even have them
Searching "SE 215 replacement parts" turns up nothing as well
It's the weekend now and I have to wait until Monday to call Shure b/c their tech support is only open M-F
*** UPDATE 6/24/2014 ***I had called Shure 3 days after my last review, and they said to ship the bad ear bud back to them for repair and pointed me to their website where I could get instructions and the form to fill out
It was well under a 2-year warranty, so all I had to pay for was the shipping cost to send it to Shure
They state NOT to send it in a paper envelope, and that they are not responsible for the product until it reaches their facility (understandably)
So that meant I had to go to the post office and send it in a padded mailer with tracking, which cost me around $8 US
Shure didn't TELL me to send it with tracking, but the impression I got based on their instructions led me to be safer than sorry
I just received a replacement via UPS this morning
So I've raised my rating one star based on the fast turnaround; while not convenient, it was certainly better than having to purchase a new pair
I would have liked to have been given a shipping label via email or some form of shipping where I didn't have to pay for it
True, $8 is better than $70, but still
I also raised my rating another star to 4 stars because I realized I didn't rate this product on sound quality and overall use, which are both rather good
During the week I had to use alternative ear buds (a $30 brand bought at an airport kiosk), I realize now how far superior these Shure buds are
The molding sleeve (can't think of any other way to describe it) that rests over the ear is a very nice thing to have along with the slider that allows you to sinch-up the cord to the back of your head and allows for a tight and secure fit
I can ditto the responses here
I play bass full time and these things sound great
If you are looking for a way to not go into the red buying gear for your gigs, I would look at these
They sound fantastic
You can certainly spend a lot of money on ears, but for the price these are more than usable
This pair of headsets are quite good
great sound, good cord and nice size
The issue I have is with me
My right ear canal does not go in at the correct angle so my right ear doesn't get sealed like my left
This causes the sound to not be as good as it can be
The soft buds completely seal the ear which is nice but when you are eating you notice pressure build up in the ears and I find myself touching the ear-buds a lot when that happens
Overall, great sound size and customization possibilities with the provided buds
These are some great earbud headphones better then the last pair I had that gave out in two months (denon Ah-250)
Sometime it's hard to get in but once their in they don't come out and the sound is awesome the bass and mids sound great
I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for something different
Love them
Snug fit ensures clear, rich, and uninterrupted sound from external noise (great for music and even the Indy 500)
Sound is detailed, plenty of low rich bass, and terrific for Classical as well as pop/rock
Took a while to figure out how they fit into the ear, but now they're easy
You cant expect more for this amount of money ,is good , kind of solid and they work if You are using IEMs
I've owned two previous models of Shure earphones, all of which were similar in desigh to these
However, I always manage to leave them on a plane or at a hotel thanks to heavy busines travel and my general forgetfullness
The sound is always excellent and I prefer this type to other (electronically) noise cancelling designs
After a year of use, these are my least favorite
No real complaints on the sound (and after all that's what's most important) but I found the wire used on the SE215s too inflexible
Despite the articulating design, it is difficult to determine which is the left or right and the cable is not flexible enough to comforatably wear with wire-behind-the-ear which is my preference
The plastic around the connector is too large for most iPhones if you are using a protective phone case
Shure no longer includes ear buds made with the foam material I liked (though it may be available for order)
As with all of the Shure earbuds I've owned, correct positioning in the ear is critical so I would have liked more choices included
However, these picky complaints aside, I still think these guys make the best sounding earbuds out there - well worth the additional cost (if you can avoid losing them)
You really can't hear anyone when you have these on, which is pretty amazing, because I never really want to hear anyone
removing the foam attachments is difficult
Once you get the technique down, it becomes easier
Best way to do it is to take something non-metalic (end of credit card, etc) and push from the bottom up on the center rubber body of the foam attachment
Anyway, sound on these is amazing
I can't say I've tried earbuds that sound better than these
For $100, they blow away just about everything
I find these to sound extremely neutral and a little boring to listen to without an EQ and headphone amp
They have a true monitor sound
I prefer to listen to them with my headphone amp - this is where they really shine
When amplified these little guys can put out some impactful sub-bass down to 35htz while keeping the balance of your music in check
Meaning, the mids and high's are not distorted
I will say the 4k area of these IEM's can be a bit harsh sounding, but a simple adjustment to the EQ can correct that
I have around 80 hours on them currently
I do not know if they need a burn in, but I did the usual day of alternating pink-white sound, then the rest of the time with a variety a music ranging from rock, metal, electronic and dub
I wish i could say the sound changed, but I don't think it did
Unlike some headphones that really re-shape themselves after a burn in, these just seem to remain consistent, clear and fun to listen to
If you are going to listen to them on your phone or tablet, you might not be too excited about them, but with a good amp and equalizer, i find these to be a very warm, full sounded IEM, and would purchase them again should I lose or break mine
There were in deed, sound isolating
Would be ideal in long-use term setting such as on a long flight
However, due to the stiffness of the cable, they are a dickens to put on
Would or could not use these on a daily basis
The sound is quite good once you get them on properly
Connector too short for iPad Air with cover on
Over ear design difficult to wear
Ear pieces just OK
, none stay put in my ears therefore sound isolation is not as expected
I use this on stage as an in ear monitor and it worked great
Going to buy another one for another musician
I had an earlier model of the same earphones and loved the sound and fit
through extensive use and years of wear they eventually lost some functionality
I have since tries Beats, Denon, Sony, Marley, and have QC Bose over the ear
I my opinion Shure has the best sound quality and construction
I am not has hyped up has most people are with Bose and thought in ear/active noise cancellation and sound from the Denon set was better but Shure is my favorite by far
I bought these to be my knock-around IEMs (workouts and so on) and was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality
Very nice bass and overall presence alongside good sound isolation makes them ideal for busy environments
But what I can't get past is just how badly they fit
Everyone's ears are different but I've had many different IEMs over the years and these are the first that ever actually hurt
I can't wear them for more than maybe 30-45 minutes without having to take a break since they've rubbed my outer ear raw, the driver is just too long
The overly long and badly positioned memory-wire doesn't help since to get it into a useful position it will then force the back of the IEMs harder into your skin
Bottom line: very good sound quality for the money, but depending on your ear size/shape you might be in for a painful experience
These do what they are advertised to do
I gave them 3 stars because I have a very difficult time inserting them in my ears
Once in, they're fine
Also, the cord should be longer
I have had these for just under a week and have to say that these are absolutely amazing
I was travelling and forgot to pack my Bose noise cancelling headphones for the flight - which truthfully are way too bulky anyway
I came across these at the airport of all places and am so glad that the sales rep recommended these above all others (value for price - I didn't want to spend too much considering I already had pricey ones at home)
It was actually the fit that sold me on these (I was given a disposable sample to try out first)
You would think these are not comfortable but they are, there is a bit of wearing in period (for me my right ear canal only) but after a couple days I was used to them or they had adapted - in fact I fell asleep with them on for an entire night and didn't wake up with any issues
There is a process to wearing them but after figuring it out, it gets incredibly easy and the over the ear wire eventually molds to the shape of your ear (this was something the rep had told me about and I have found this to be the case)
I've worn these to work out and they never moved at all unlike every other in ear model I have used in the past (I normally use Beats Tours for workouts)
Bottom line, I did not hear a single thing other than my music while flying, so objective accomplished
Says something that I've been using these over my other (much more expensive in the case of the Bose) headphones
If you love in-ear headphone with excellent audio quality, plus a noise cancelling feature, your search is over
The price is high but the experience is worth every single penny
I'm currently using it at work and is so light to wear, and more than that external noise doesn't bother me anymore
I don't recommend using it outdoor, might be dangerous to not listen sirens, honks etc
Very nice Bass heavy signature
Really good indeed
It's not by any means a balanced iems, it is bass heavy and the highs are a bit lacking
I like that
Flat signatures are boring in my honest opinion
It's also very isolating, something some people don't like but I love
Overall it is a fantastic I'm, I struggle to find any big con's
I've had Westone W20's (three sets)
All purchased directly from Westone (trying to avoid Amazon's CA sales tax)
All failed within the warrantee period
On the last set one of ear piece cases simply fell apart - lost the other case half so couldn't glue it back together
The other two had cable and electronic issues
Fidelity was okay with the Westone's but they kept falling apart
Frustrating
AMERICAN made
Hardly
I now have a set of Shure SE215-K's and they are GREAT
Much better cables
Better construction
Very comfortable
The fidelity is as good as Westone, IMO
My music voice is classical guitar, Celtic instrumental and some "new age"
They all sound wonderful
Not too much bass and not too much treble
Well balanced for my music choices
I don't use the foam sleeves preferring the Soft Flex silicone sleeves - they work great
To each their own
I wonder what took me so long to wake up
Guess it's my devotion to the idea of "American Made"
Had these for 3 years
Left ear just stopped working
Not clogged
I check the right ear on the left side and it works, so i know its not the wire
I checked the resistance of the speaker coils, left and right chanel
left speaker completly open
It just failed
One minute they were working, the next silence
always listen at a casual volume
3 years it not to bad I guess, thats why i gace it 4 stars, and they do sound very nice
Same time the left speaker died, the right speaker wire ( metal wire to allow to stay bent around the ear) broke, poked through the casing and stabbed my ear, lol
So it seems they have a 3 year life give or take before it starts t break down
100 bucks seems high to me for these, but after 3 years of constant use, its nnot such a bad price tag
I bought these for my birthday and I fell in love with them, I attached the white 3 triple sleeves that I bought on a separate order and they worked great
For a drummer there is literally no other earbud for the price thats better
The quality of the sound is great, The noise cancelling is PERFECT
Unfortunately with my stupid actions of carelessness I stepped on one of my nozzles and the tip broke off so I couldn't use one of the  earbuds, I thought that was it, a waste of $100
But thanks to Shures AWESOME protective guarantee, Amazon is one of their distributors so I had a 2 year warranty on it
For free
I shipped them out on wednesday and they are coming today on monday
I bought 11 pair and 4 didn't work right and 1 has since quit working
This is a lot of money for earbuds that are not going to last
Our family has always bought Beats
I wanted to try these to see if they would fit my ears better
I love these headphones
They fit great, sound amazing and are very durable
I would highly recommend these to anyone
Plus, they are a great value
I would by this brand again
The 3 stars I gave has nothing to do with sound quality
I love the balance, clarity, and sound isolation that these headphones provide
when they work
I gave 3 stars because quite often the connection between the left ear driver connection and the cable connection seem to lose contact and sound will cut in and out depending on how the cord moves
I searched around and noticed several people who have had the exact same issue on forums
I would recommend doing a bit of research before you commit to buying these headphones
Bottom line though is that sound quality is absolutely amazing
again when it's working properly
These headphones are worth every penny
i have no idea how they don't come up as being one of, if not the best for around $100
They block almost all of the noise out due to the foam ear buds and the sound quality is fantastic
They are small and compact and I know what ear buds i will be buying the next time
Looking for high quality sound isolating earphones
Want to save some cash
This is the route to go
Top quality from shure and you save some cash with amazon
Great sound, but too difficult to place in the ear, which is critical to the sound quality, especially the low end
I found myself havingto use a mirror just to see how to insert the buds properly, and the cable is a bit too cumbersome around the ears
These are fantastic
I listened to an album that I'm very familiar with, and was amazed at how much detail it brought out
The sound isolation is fantastic, although at times I wish I could hear more of the world around me when walking
I love these earbuds
They do an amazing job of isolating and cutting out the background noise
I also like that they fit comfortably and stay put when I run
It served me well as it is advertised
It really isolated external sounds and presented a well balanced sounds to my ear
I should start off by saying that I am not an expert on headphones, and don't have any data to back up my opinions, but I have owned quite a few pairs of headphones/IEM's over time (enough for my family to make fun of me
) The other headphones most recently in my rotation are Bose Sie2 for working out, Bose AE2, and Audio Technica ATH-M50
The Bose AE2 are supremely comfortable, but just don't sound that great
The Bose Sie2 are great for working out in that the cord is so conveniently short, and they stay in regardless of the rigor of your activity
And the M50's sound better than any other headphones I've ever owned, with their highly accurate sound that lets you hear everything in the recording
So where do the SE215 fit in
In my use the answer is every time except when I'm working out or sitting at my home desk and in the mood for high accuracy
I find myself reaching for these IEM's constantly
They are comfortable and easy to put in your ears, and they sound great
And I'm saying that as someone who appreciates M50s for their accuracy
These IEMs are certainly more exaggerated in the low end, but I find that to be necessary for IEMs considering the environments I use them in, plus it's just fun to listen to
They also block an incredible amount of sound, so that I feel that I have no need for big sound-cancelling headphones, and I can easily tune out or even not hear noisy environments around me
They come with a nice carrying case that is easy to get the IEM in and out of
This once again makes them great for carrying everywhere
And finally they are very discreet, especially in the clear color, which can sometimes be convenient
I wish they would have fit and sound half way decent
They made my ears hurt when they stayed on and sounded like a empty beer can, no base at all
The Bose equivalent are just a little bit more expensive but magnitudes better sound and fit, and if you want the ultimate then get the Bose noise canceling
Either of the Bose are magnitudes better than these
They sound fantastic and the music sounds true
They have proven to be durable so far
I also like that they are very inconspicuous
These headphones are amazing
I will admit that it is difficult at first getting used to putting the buds in your ears
Pro: I've owned variety of earphones from different brands over the years ranging from Sony, Skullcandy, to Bose
The shure by far has the best sound quality out of all the pairs I've owned
The bass is punchy but not overpowering and the highs are clear
The mids blends in well in between
The build quality of the earphones is good, very sturdy
It is very comfortable to wear and fits very snug and gives excellent isolation
I travel by subway everyday and these help create my own world amidst the hecticness of the loud background noises
Con: Now I will say something about the cables
I maybe be of good quality but it is way too long
Many like their cables long but these are unnecessarily long
The ipod and/or the phone sits insides the pant pocket that's less that 1 meter from the ears
It does not need to be so long that there are excess amount of wires hanging outside of the pocket
As mentioned above, I travel on the crowded subway everyday with lots of people and the extra hanging wires would be a hazard as it can get damaged when it gets caught on other people's cloths or bags
Other than that it's a great pair of earphones
These are great sounding earbuds and when placed properly in the ear they eliminate a lot of noise
My only complaint is that I have trouble getting the wires to dress the way I would like them to go
I have used these quite a bit, and the more I use them, the more I love these
For $100, the sound quality is out of this world
As a drummer, I have the volume cranked with all instruments mic'd up
The low end from the kick and bass guitar come through great with no clipping at all
Would highly recommend to anyone
The only drawback is that they take a little bit to break in the cable that wraps around your ears
But once they do break in, they stay in your ears perfectly
I have always had a hard time finding buds that will stay in my ears, but these work fantastic
Highly recommend
These earphones have amazing sound
Much better than the $300 Bose earphones
The one design issue is that they have an abnormal design where the wire goes over your ear and around the back
This is via a more rigid conforming wire and can be preferred by some and not by others
Love em
Amazing sound and clarity
Using these in my worship band at church, on stage
Cheaper than most, but couldn't ask for better sound
I highly recommend these to anyone performing on stage or just lookin for an awesome earpiece for an ipod or mp3
Cables were a little stiff out of the box and headphones do require a few hours of burn in time
But these are the best headphones in the $100 range that I've heard
These are my second pair
Very good
Sound system on point
Very sharp and decent bass
Would recommend to a friend
Shure over did it
Right now I am doing a head to head ;) comparison with Etymotic Research (ER) HF5
The Etymotic Research HF5 were way better than the Bose IE2 (they aren't even in the same class as either - despite the 1000's of over the moon reviews for the Bose) and they were better than Shure SE215-K
The Bose were out of the running right away - flabby sound, "rounded" (lack of) detail
Bad
The Shure I liked, they were comfortable and sounded good, but the ER HF5 were definitely more detailed, although a bit less bass, the sound was more detailed and nuanced, by a significant amount
After 20 or 30 minutes it was clear to me that the ER was the best of the three, nuanced, detailed, musical
As many will say, they are not the most comfortable to wear, but I got the hang of wearing them and found that I enjoyed listening to them
After a few hours (on an airplane) I found my ears were just a bit sore
I just used the earpieces that they came fitted with - there are other choices, which might have been more comfortable, but, for the most part, I was OK with the ones that they came with
I figured I would change them at another time
And so, I thought I was set
HOWEVER, I read about a product that I had not heard of - the RHA MA750i - a glowing review in an audiophile publication
So I ordered a pair to compare
Now, I am, more or less, an audiophile - yes, I have spent thousands of dollars on power cables, interconnects and speaker cables
I do realize that listening from my smartphone isn't the same - the source isn't as clean - so I had reasonable expectations for what ear buds might do
However, that being said, I do believe that I know how to judge sound - detail, timbre, tonality, sound staging and that most ephemeral - musicality
Is it involving
That being said, I put on the RHA using a CD source
They immediately sounded great
Very warm, melodic, beautiful tones, rounded, detailed
I could hear the drum skin slap in a precise and defined way
Compared to the EM (which were pretty well broken in at this point), they are more involving, more bass, warmer overall, and yet, as many "warm" sounding speakers can get muddy, I was careful to listen for detail and it certainly is there - harmonies, cymbal work, etc
It was all there with a bigger "sound stage" than the EM have
The RHA are a bit more sensitive, so I was careful to turn them down a bit after listening to the EM
The EM are very good, very "flat" sounding, with space around the instruments, but they lack warmth and they don't image as well as the RHA, they aren't as detailed, particularly in the treble (cymbals), they definitely have less bass
Also, bottom line, the RHA are super comfortable, so no issue with that
And they are made better, more solid, thicker wires - and they have a longer warranty
Overall the RHA are warmer and more involving, with more bass and easy to wear
The EM are fussy with placement
They can easily get pushed or pulled out of the perfect alignment they require to sound good
To me, there is no doubt that the RHA MA750i are the best of those I listened to
I don't think you would absolutely regret buying the EM but I suspect the vast majority of people would prefer the RHA
And, just to get ahead of this - I listened to pop, classical and jazz on all the ear buds
A few extra thoughts
If you can't, or don't want, to spend this much money on ear buds, I have listened to a few pair in a lower price category
Although I did not do an exhaustive listening, I can easily recommend the Beyerdynamic MMX 101 - you should listen to them before you settle on a purchase under ~$90 - they are ~ $63
The more I listen to the RHAMA750i the more I like them
Once they are broken in, I can only expect them to sound better, but right out of the box, they are 5/5 sound wise, 5/5 build quality, 5/5 comfort, 5/5 warranty
10/5 value
Hope this review helps
These are AWESOME
Only complaint I have is that the sleeves that actually go in the ear are a bit hard to get off, but since you shouldn't be changing them every hour anyways its not a problem
Bought these on a whim for my commuting and running
The noise isolation is impressive
I find they sound better and are more comfortable than my last Bose ie2 pair
Overall a good purchase if they are in your price range
I just got these in today and tried them out in the gym while running
I gave up on Etymotics because they are pricey to repair, and the wires on my numerous etys go bad yearly
Rather than pay up to $80 for repairs on each set, I got these to try
Since replacement cables are in the $20 range, I will get a cable as a backup and should be set
In the gym where my sweat gets all over these, they performed great
After the workout, I took it all apart - eartips, cable, earphone pieces
all detatched, and laid out to dry for the next day
I think this earphone will last well over a year
Cable is thick and seems able to withstand daily winding/unwinding
I keep this in a rigid camera case, rather than the included soft case
I learned that from having delicate Etymotics :)I ordered the Shure flanged tips with these, and compared them to the Etymotics ones, which I've used for over a decade
The Shure brand is a hair smaller than Etymotics, so I used the Etymotics tips
I'll try the Shure ones later, but I'm happy to report that the Etymotic silicone tips work on this model
EDIT: Just a note, if you use etymotic silicone tips, don't push them all the way in
There's a ridge on each earpiece, just push the etymotic tip a little bit over the ridge
You can push it all the way on, but I couldn't get a proper seal
A little over halfway on, and it works perfect for me
I use this paired with a Jabra Play bluetooth piece, which is the size of a AA battery
Plug the earphones into that, clip it to the back of my shirt collar, and it works wirelessly with my Samsung Galaxy tablet
Sound is great
Recommended
I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because the way the Shure goes into your ear, and the way you curl the sturdy cable wire around the top of your ear, is a bit wierd
It works, but it is odd to me
Also, there's no option for a shorter cable at the time, like a 24 inch one
so you can strap your music player to your arm and have the cable just long enough to reach it
I workout with the wireless piece behind my neck, and the long cable is dangling behind me down to my waste
As I run, it flops around like a tail
Small cons, though
I can live with the cable length and the odd wire shaping around the ear
For the $100 price and the thick, removable cable, this is THE workout earphones for an audiophile like me
Recommended for music lovers who sweat when they workout
I upgraded from Apple ear buds
These blow them out of the water in terms of sound quality
Sound stage is amazing, highs, mids, and lows are all there
Once you fit them correctly (with the provided foamies), these are incredible noise isolating IEMs
I work downtown in a major city and I can hardly hear traffic between songs when walking about
Pros:- Sound quality is excellent; once fitted correctly, they produce an incredible sound stage, including bass
- Noise isolation is excellent; I can hardly hear traffic let alone colleagues in the cubes next door
- Nice length of cable; not too long but not too short
Travel case is handy when not in use
Monitors are detachable
Cons:- The stiff over-the-ear "memory line" that molds to the back of your ear takes getting used to
Putting these on and taking off takes a decent effort in comparison to non over-the-ear types of IEMs
Maybe these are a good pair of headphones Amazon says the price list is $199
00False
if you go to the SHURE web page you'll see that the regular price for these are $99
00 which is the "special price in Amazon" where you save 52%Bad
These are my first venture into high-end monitors and I couldn't be happier with my purchase
I bought these to use as earplugs and to play music while riding my motorcycle, but they're comfortable enough  for me to wear them all day at my desk
I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a nicer set of IEMs
These buds sound very good
Contrary to what some have said, they have good bass response once you get the right seal
They fit well and are easy to put on once you get used to doing it
As far as i can tell, they will never fall out during normal use
I use them for in-ear monitors for performing and recording
The only fault i can find, and this is likely true of all in ear monitors, is that they seem to amplify the sound of your voice "in your head"
This is likely due to the sound isolation, as you get the same effect if you simply plug your ears with your fingers
So that takes some getting used to
If you don't think you can deal with it your other option would be headphones
I'd recommend the Sony MDR-V6
They are totally transparent with no bass boost built in
I would recommend these to musicians and audiophiles who want good sounding ear buds costing less than $100
Update 5/26/14;I found that selecting just the "right" tips can optimize these buds for different applications
For listening to music recordings, a tight fit maximizes bass response and isolation
For use as an in-ear monitor, it seems a slightly looser fit is desirable, allowing for somewhat less isolation and providing a more neutral sound with slightly less bass
It takes a bit of experimenting to find the right tips for each application
but the results are well worth the effort
For me, the best selection turned out to be the large rubber tips for listening to music and the medium rubber tips when i use them as monitors
Hope this helps
These are awesome IEMs
I can't speak of them highly enough
Other reviewers have already written about its qualities, so I won't go over that
I'd just to add that I bought these and Shure's SE315 to decide which ones I'd like most
To my ears, there is no comparison
The SE315 has a much more flat, boring, cold, sound
So "analytical" that it makes the songs sound weird, really different from their original mix
The SE215 on the other hand have plenty of bass, slightly recessed mids (not to the point of shadowing vocals, actually rock vocals sound great on these), and present, perfect, controlled highs, not fatiguing at all
I have tried like 15 IMEs to date, some cheaper, some more expensive, but these are hands down my favorites (followed close by JVC’s HA-FX T90)
Once you get used to the over-the-ear cable thing of these, I must say they are really comfortable
And be sure (pardon my quibble) to use Shure's olives ear tips, they are absolutely the best, better even than Comply's
Interesting
Initial response: never had in ear monitors before, getting used to putting them in your ears is kind of tricky, only have done it 3 or 4 times so far, and I always end up getting them backwards or something
BUt they feel good and feel like they will stick in your ears and not pull out like some ear buds
i could see jogging in these
Little disappointed in the cord length
feels like 3'
i thought they were a little longer
but then I could see people complaining about long cords too
Its a decent size, i just like the length of recording headphones - so you can move around
i use them at work so would be nice to plug in the computer and be able to walk around a little
But nice length if have a device on your person
They sound great
been listening to daft punk - decent bass - wasn't looking for a super bass earbud, sounds kind of gimmicky (beatz
) i like true sound - and monitors i suppose help achieve this
In ear monitors may be the ticket
my ears feel cool
not the case with my studio AKG's at home
They tend to get a litle warm
Got to get used to the style - over the ear thing and people might look at you weird, but they feel good, sound great
I like them
Wasn't sure what to buy and for the price, meh
Wanted the other cord with mic and volume control  for android, but saw poor reviews
and i don't know if i'd use the mic/volume as much as I think i would
but would be a nice option
I like these because the cord can disconnect from the phones
always a good feature if something happened to the cord or vice versa
Cons: connie (the name)
I am really struggling with these earbuds
Audio quality is great but, I cannot get them positioned so they will stay in my ears
Slight movement and one, or the other, or both, will pop out
Then they are difficult to reposition
I have the SE115 and SE210 earbuds
I lost the 115's and decided that the SE215 was for me based on my excellent experience with Shure
They definitely are an upgrade in audio quality but not enuf to offset the discomfort I felt in my outer ear after wearing them for a couple of hours
I tried wearing them for extended periods of time on several occasions with the same result and regrettably, I had to return them
The 210's are still great earbuds so I won't lose any sleep over not being able to keep the 215's
Just somewhat disappointed
But on the upside
I found my 115's so all's well that ends well
Was in need of quality ear buds that have the high tech capabilities and functions for studio work and stage stuff
Very pleased
You will not be disappointed
The ear hooks keep the buds in
The sound quality is much better than my Klipsch S4a
They are comfortable, even after long periods of wear
I really like their sound signature
I just got these in today and tried them out in the gym while running
I gave up on Etymotics because they are pricey to repair, and the wires on my numerous etys go bad yearly
Rather than pay up to $80 for repairs on each set, I got these to try
Since replacement cables are in the $20 range, I will get a cable as a backup and should be set
In the gym where my sweat gets all over these, they performed great
After the workout, I took it all apart - eartips, cable, earphone pieces
all detatched, and laid out to dry for the next day
I think this earphone will last well over a year
Cable is thick and seems able to withstand daily winding/unwinding
I keep this in a rigid camera case, rather than the included soft case
I learned that from having delicate Etymotics :)I ordered the Shure flanged tips with these, and compared them to the Etymotics ones, which I've used for over a decade
The Shure brand is a hair smaller than Etymotics, so I used the Etymotics tips
I'll try the Shure ones later, but I'm happy to report that the Etymotic silicone tips work on this model
EDIT: Just a note, if you use etymotic silicone tips, don't push them all the way in
There's a ridge on each earpiece, just push the etymotic tip a little bit over the ridge
You can push it all the way on, but I couldn't get a proper seal
A little over halfway on, and it works perfect for me
I use this paired with a Jabra Play bluetooth piece, which is the size of a AA battery
Plug the earphones into that, clip it to the back of my shirt collar, and it works wirelessly with my Samsung Galaxy tablet
Sound is great
Recommended
I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because the way the Shure goes into your ear, and the way you curl the sturdy cable wire around the top of your ear, is a bit wierd
It works, but it is odd to me
Also, there's no option for a shorter cable at the time, like a 24 inch one
so you can strap your music player to your arm and have the cable just long enough to reach it
I workout with the wireless piece behind my neck, and the long cable is dangling behind me down to my waste
As I run, it flops around like a tail
Small cons, though
I can live with the cable length and the odd wire shaping around the ear
For the $100 price and the thick, removable cable, this is THE workout earphones for an audiophile like me
Recommended for music lovers who sweat when they workout
Wasn't really expecting to much but was pleasantly surprised how good they worked, the bottom end was very good and I could here my Bass guitar a lot better than I did with the 400$ ones I was using before
Would recommend for anyone using them for live playing
I've owned some of my music for several decades, but now, listening to it with these earphones I feel like I am hearing it for the first time
These are extremely well made and worth the money for what they deliver
I have been threw at least 20 different types of ear bubs but these are the best ever
Thank youChef-Frankie
LIked: The sound quality is incredible
Disliked: The way they wrap around your ear
It's like I have to figure it out each time I put them on
LOL it's just a small thing but it kept me from giving them 5 stars
I'd definitely recommend these
Damn, who knew getting just the right ear bud at the right price would be so difficult
I run about 3 miles a day on a treadmill at my health club
If I can hear myself breath, or there is a cable thump or the bass is distorted or too shallow, or there isn't enough treble, or too much treble, or they are not loud enough, or they are too loud, or they are uncomfortable, I can't use them
Boy, now that I am reading my review I sound really picky
I guess that's cause i am with buds
I've tried; bose, Sony (not bad but not good enough) Yurbuds, Klipsh, an active type of Sony buds, Etymotics, Adidas Senheisers, and a bunch I can't even remember
All around the $100
00 to $125
00 mark
I have to admit that when I got these I was not overwhelmed but had resigned to using them as I was more tired of exchange and lost all hope that there was something great waiting for me to try
I used the white triple flange rubber earpieces (licked them before I put them it) and viola
I got a tight seal that provided the right mix for my exercise
I have to admit they are a bit of a pain to get into my ears at first, but when they're in, they're in for the duration
There is very minimal thumping and the cord tucks away over my ears around the back of my head so they never get tangled while in use
I think the people that complain about the cord are losers because it is a bit thicker but who cares as you never see it anyway
I've only had them for a few weeks but so far they are really eggsellent
Two thumbs up as long as you use the white flange ear tips
Oh almost forget, cut a smidge of the rubber from the end of the tuby like end of the flanges so they didn't reach so far in my ear and now they are comfy as all get out
When I bought these, I was looking for sound quality above all else; these have certainly delivered
What amazes me the most is the midrange
Both the base and the highs are absolutely wonderful, but the midrange sounds like nothing I'd ever heard before
When it comes to the fit, I found that they can be a little difficult
However, as long as you actually take the time to try the different eartips and find the best match, everything works out excellently
The foam tips will get the best seal (and hence the best sound), but I found that I couldn't always get a reliable seal; I would often have to fiddle around a bit before they were well settled
That said, the rubber tips (or maybe they're silicone, I'm not sure) will create a seal that is excellent, if just a little under the standard of the foam tips
I use the rubber ones because they're much less of a hassle to get a good seal with
Just pop them in, and you have a reliable, easy seal
During the first few weeks, I found that the rubber created a slightly unpleasant pressure (sometimes almost like the pressure changes one experiences while flying)
However, the rubber tips slowly moulded themselves the shape of my ears, and they now fit without any unpleasant pressure
A good friend of mine who uses the foam has told me that they, also, have started to mould to his ears
I've never really had any problems with the wire stiffness around my ears, after a week or so, they were quite firmly in the best position, and didn't unbend unless forced
So a few months into my ownership of the Shure SE215-CL, I can honestly say that I have no regrets buying these earphones
These are a good value for the price
They did not block out all sound but for the price they worked well
I would not recommend these ear buds to anyone
I have had Shure earbuds in the past and normally Shure is an excellent product but I would not recommend the SE215-K earbuds to my worst enemy
They do not fit well in the ear, the way the cable fits is atrocious
What on earth where the Shure engineers thinking
I wear these IEMs maybe 6-times a month or so as I play at church
This morning, I was greeted with a blown right ear monitor after 6-months of use
I hear SHURE is fantastic when it comes to warranty and they are a local company for me, so I have full confidence SHURE will take care of it, but I expected better performance
We'll see how the warranty claim goes
UPDATE: I live in the Chicago area and so I brought my SE215s directly to SHURE
They changed out the bad ear bud and I was on my way in 10-minutes
Yes, the ear bud blew and I'm not sure why, but the customer service was impeccable
I am probably going to upgrade to 1964ears, but the great service makes me think long and hard about going away from SHURE
My first rating was 1-star, but I have upped it to 4 now
3
5 is probably more accurate, but I can't do half-stars
These headphones are worth every penny
i have no idea how they don't come up as being one of, if not the best for around $100
They block almost all of the noise out due to the foam ear buds and the sound quality is fantastic
They are small and compact and I know what ear buds i will be buying the next time
Who knew that you could buy $100 in ears and they would actually seal inside your ear and give you great isolation
The transparency is spot on for the price
I program and track live and these work great
These isolate the s*** out of sound, I can barely hear anything when they're in
And the sound quality is just preposterously good
The cord is super duper long too so they're great for the gym
Biggest complaint is that they just look nerdy as s***
These are what I expected and sound ok for my band
Not too expensive and I use them with the MiPRO wireless system
I would not use these for stage performance in live situations but they are perfect for listening to recorded music
However, the only people usually used to this type of in-ear are stage performers
For stage performers used to higher quality dual or triple drivers ears, these will disappoint
For casual listener who is looking for something better than stock ear buds, these will be uncomfortable and take some getting used to
If properly inserted (which is key), they sound very good and are hard to pull out from body movement
Quality of sound and build is much better than the Beats or anything you will buy at a box store
if you want an objective review of the sound quality and build quality of this earphones, you can either youbue it or google it
I am pretty sure they are the single best earphone at this price range that can actually rival the much more expensive ones
Thus i won't delve into the technical side of this earphone because there is already plenty of sites out there that do this better than i can
well, I am more shock of is the unparalleled build quality of this baby
this thing just look classy and everything is fantastic
The earbuds are made of memory foam, the shapes bend to best fit your ear canal
One of the side benefits the foamed earbud is the superb noise isolation; i can't even hear the typing from my mechanical keyboard while listening to music on medium volume
Even though the wire is replaceable, it is double layered to increase durability
Mine is the silver version so the wired is sheathed in a thin transparent white plastic, looks awesome
the earphone fits so well and comfortable inside your ear you won't even notice it after a minute or 2
I run with it almost everyday and it never falls
All in all, i am extremely impressed by how well this product is and at 99 dollars it just dwarfs the competition
It does take a while to get used to putting it on on a regular basis and it does look weird for some people
UPDATE:Sound quality is fine as usualbut sadly there is already distortion of sound causing by the connector
oh man, as a vivid earphone user the very sign of this gives me a big headache especially for a pair of earphones that has only been used for less than 2 weeks and is being extremely well taken care of
i am sending it back for a replacement, hopefully the next one will be problem free
i dont want to downgrade my review until i extensively test the new one
hopefully mine was only a lemon because i really like this product
Love my earphones
Only complaint is that the included earbuds are crap
If you get these then also purchase a separate set of Shure sleeves made specifically for this model
Wasn't expecting the bass to be as good and was going to eventually get a pair of dual drivers
These convinced me that I'm fine with single-drivers
Great product
No complaint what so ever
The product is well made and as it is described
Delivers a good sound
Good
Update 9 July 2014:I have had no end of problems with the left ear bud cutting out
A little wiggling and it would work, but it would cut out again shortly after
I thought it was the end of the ear bug pushing against my ear canal, sealing the end, but it was not
It ended up being a poorly fitting connector on the ear bud
I took a very small screwdriver and bend the center pin just a tiny bit and it now they don't cut out anymore
After living with these things for three months (I wear them 1/2 hour a day, at least), I am no more excited about them
I have managed to bend the wire near the ear bud to get them stay in better, but I find the wire will flip around (off of my ear), making them want to come out again
I also used a paint pen to paint a red stripe on the right ear bud so I can tell which is which
Shure should have done something like this from the factory
The tiny red dot they put on there is difficult to see, especially when light is poor
The rotation of the ear bud makes a big difference is fit
Unfortunately, rotating the ear bud changes where the cord exits, and affects the fit, so some wire bending and trial and error is required to get the fit right if I rotate them
While these ear buds can be made to fit OK, it ends up being a project, and I don't want a project to wear ear buds
I have never had so much problems with ear bud fit  before
It's really too bad, as the basic concept of a good sounding, passively sound isolating ear bud is a great idea
I use them when in the garage -- they double as a music source and hear protection in one
It's an idea that worked very well in their previous versions
Original review:This is my fourth set of Shure sound isolating headphones
They have historically died by the insulation cracking after a year of two
I was excited to see that they updated their design - removable cables and the extra layer of insulation around the ear gave me hope that they would last longer
What I did not expect was that they fit has changed drastically
I have worn the previous generation for countless many hour stretches when working
I've worn them on many 12+ hour plane rides
I have never had any significant complaints about the fit for the previous generation models
This generation is completely different and don't fit me well at all
The right ear manages to stay in, but the left doesn't
There is a lot more bulk of rigid plastic to this model and if they don't fit your ear, too bad, they will fall out
I understand that everyone's ears are different, but dealing with that is the name of the game when making headphones
On top of that, the extra insulation around the ear makes the cord very stiff, which makes them more prone to falling out
I was looking forward to the extra insulation, thinking it would help longevity, but if they fall out all the time, then it won't matter
I suppose these will be my last Shure product
My seven year old Shure EC2s were showing their age
and I bought them back when they were *way* more expensive than they were when they were discontinued
I called Shure, direct, for some replacement tips and asked what is the current replacement for the EC2s and they told me about the SE215s
So, even though my old E2Cs still work fine, I gambled on their advice and purchased the new SE215s
My summary of them follows, in no particular order:1
Sound
In the end all you judge a set of monitors (headphones, buds, etc
) by
They sound as good as the EC2s and that is a serious compliment
Definitely more punchy bass
very evident first time I fired them up
Soundstage is balanced, highs are good, albeit a little less crisp than I'd prefer, but I'm a serious treble freak anyway
Not in the universe with today's monitors geared towards *extreme* bass, which is a compliment by me
Very, very good
a worthy successor to the EC2s in sound quality and imaging
2
Build quality
They're slightly smaller than past Shure in-ears, which is good
Come standard with the medium, foam inserts
Monumental pain removing these, initially
TIP: Don't try to twist them
get a fingernail under the bottom of the tip barrel and carefully (and with MUCHO force) work them off the main body sleeve
Genuinely, I thought I was breaking them and sending them back they were on that hard
Be forewarned if you don't like the standards tips
after getting them off, all subsequent changes were slick and easy
3
Cord
Nicer in a way, pain in another major way
Larger cord than prior models, super, super tough
Replaceable too
How cool is that
You *never* see replaceable cords in sub $200 kit, ever
Course, they're also even tougher to remove than the tips, so, again, that's weird
They couldn't, at this price point, make them screw-in; they're snap-in
4
Fit
Here's where it gets dicey
If these are your first 'in ear canal' monitors, you have a learning curve
Everyone has different ear geometry, so, at first, it's always a crap shoot inserting 'in ears'
The seal has to be perfect and you have to experiment with the various tips to get it *just right*
In my case, I've used Shure's for years, so I've got it down to a science
Even knowing that, these were a bear getting right the first time
Why
Remember those 'larger' cords
They have a moldable, approximately 3-4 inch section that allows the phone's cord to be molded back around your ear (you do know these are 'behind the ear' cord fit, right
) and, until you get used to it, it's a pain
I had to *unlearn* years of fitting to get these things just right
That said, when you get them in right and crank on the music source, they're very, very good
Again, as good as prior Shure models and at a price point at least 50% less
There are some compromises made (no screw-in cables), cheaper tips than prior models, lack of a rewind spool in the storage case (prior models had them)
But at this price point, who cares
They work fine and are inexpensive enough that you don't baby them like a set of $500 in ear monitors
But be warned:  You will have to take time to:a) find the right tip that fits your ear's geometryb) learn to insert and get the cords just right behind your earc) learn how to take off tips occasionally and clean themGreat bargain at this price point
I've tried most of the brands in the market but I've never seen something like this before
It's a complete professional item
Unlike beats by dre(just bass and the rest is below average), Shure has proven in all kind of genres
You actually hear the other instruments that you've never heard in the song you always listen
Material has way more quality than any other brand except those $500 ones
This item is underrated
I have had these headphones for about 3 months now
I purchased them to use while I lift at the gym aboard my ship
These appealed to me because of the over-the-ear design to keep them from slipping out of my ears like my previous headphones, and because of the noise isolation
The gym on my ship also houses the A/C compressors for the accommodation which are incredibly loud
Pros:These headphones have excellent isolation and feel pretty comfortable when you find the right size foam for your ear
I have slightly different ear canal sizes so I had to use two different ones
The sound quality is pretty decent although, as some have noted, it may be a little bass heavy for some
Messing with the equalizer on your media player should help that
Cons:The cord is very thick and heavy which I thought would be a good thing but ended up making them a little cumbersome
Along with the thickness, the cord is also about 8 inches longer than any other headphone cord I have dealt with which makes keeping the cord from getting caught on things is difficult
As many other have experienced, one side of the detachable cord went out and only works when the cable is manually held in a certain position
It is probably pretty easy to see how this can be a problem
This happened after the second week of light, one hour a day use
Because I work on a ship, I didn't really have a chance to return them before my Amazon return period ended so now I am forced to go through the warranty return process
I have heard some bad things about Shure's customer service
Conclusion:Overall, if it was not for the failure of the cord and having to go through the warranty process to get it fixed, I would recommend these headphones
However, since so many people have encountered this problem (some more than once), I would say to look elsewhere for some headphones
I am fully expecting to have to do a warranty return on these multiple times and really wish I could have returned them during the warranty period
These sound amazing
much better the the ones that came with my shure in ear monitor system
Much more comfortable too
As a former Bose "over-the-ear" user, I decide to give these a try after my Bose headphones literally fell apart after nearly 10 years of flying every week for work
Bass response is better, noise canceling is better, no batteries, less bulky
what's not like
Trust me, you won't be disappointed
The plug is too short to work on any cell phone with a case
I will be returning this product
I'm not sure why my experience seems to be so different from the majority of the reviews here
I bought these based on a recommendation from someone at a local GC and the reviews here
Here are my beefs:Sound: I find the sound to be thin, very little bass
Fit: I have tried all the buds and cannot find one that just feels right for me
They always feel loose which might contribute to the sound seeming thin
The over the ear design is somewhat odd for me
Sound Isolating: this is the area where my experience is really differnet from many of the reviews
I would not classify these as sound isolating at all
I wore them on a plane flight the other day and frankly I felt they blocked no more noise than a cheap pair of skull candy's that I have
Overall I'm glad I had used a gift certificate on these  because if I had paid full freight for them I'd be even more disappointed than I am now
I'll probably just use these at work and try to find a decent pair of noise cancelling headphones elsewhere
**Update**Well I feel kind of stupid
I just couldn't understand why these things just never felt right
Well, I had them in the wrong ears
I noticed one had a very small red dot on it and I thought that maybe meant right, but it just didn't look like it would work in the right ear
After working on it a bit, I got it in and it fit and felt much better, making a large difference to how it sounded
Still not "sound isolating", but pretty good
So now I upped my review to four stars and will see how they do the next time I'm on a plane
I'm very pleased with this product
Would recommend to other musicians looking for a solid in ear monitor
Nice price too
I'm very happy with these headphones
I use them as in-ear monitors with a church band, for regular listening, and as headphones when working out
Positives:Great, well-balanced sound
Lots of earpieces, so its easy to find a good fit
Removable cord (the spot where my headphones usually break)Negatives:If you've never used behind the head headphones, they can be a bit uncomfortable at first
They REALLY block out sound
Could be a positive if you're into that sort of thing, but I can't wear them at work because they make me seem unresponsive to coworkers (in reality, I just can't hear them with these in)
Overall, these are a great value and I highly recommend them
I purchased the Shure SE215-K headphones a little over a week ago and have been overall happy with them
Two minor issues:1) The plastic part of the L-plug is too large in diameter for these to fit in my portable devices with a case on them
Neither my Galaxy Note nor my Tablet
2) they take a little practice putting them on
It's taken me a while to get where I can put them on one-handed as they really need to be seated in your ear canal for best sound
The different sized ear pieces help, but they do take a little of practice put them on easily
That said, I really like the sound
it's even and doesn't have any of the harshness I found in a lot of small driver in-ear headphones
While the sound is good I expected a larger soundstageEverything feels so
enclosed
However, for it's price and size they are amazing earbuds
Not they do need a little more power to make them better so if you dont have an amp it kinda limits the sound even more
Last month i lost another pair of Shure in-ear headphones (a different model that is now discontinued) and I was mad
I loved those for their sound, construction quality and the carrying case they come with
I really wanted to get the exact same ones again but they are now discontinued, so somehow i convinced myself to try some Harman Kardon AE's
BIG MISTAKE
Sound was average but they were the most uncomfortable things to wear and their carrying case was terrible
So, i sent them back and got these Shure SE215's
These things are a STEAL for the price
They sound awesome, they are VERY comfortable to wear and they even look cool
They are the same style as rockstars wear during their concerts
I wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere
Get these and stop reading reviews
Happy Shopping
One side of my Klipsch S4's went out so I was looking for a replacement around the $100 price range
The headphones primary use will be at the gym and secondarily at an office job
After some online research, I decided on the Shure SE-215
I've had them for a little over a month and I'm happy with my decision so far
Sound wise, I would say that it is slightly better than the S4's because of the foam tips which reduces outside noise
There's a little learning curve getting adjusted to the over the ear placement and the feeling of the foam tips vs rubber tips but it's worked out for me so far
Pros- Great sound for the price
Foam tips create a good seal blocking outside noise
- Over the ear fitment
This took a bit to get used to but it keeps the headphones in place with lots of movement
- Replaceable cable
Cons- Cable is ridiculously long
- Very difficult to change tips
Changing tips is a chore and shouldn't be as difficult
After reading a log of reviews both positive and negative, i took the plunge and bought a pair of these
The quality of the earphones is great if you could get them to stay on your ear
Having them stay on my ears was the most challenging part of it
They would keep falling out even if you start chewing gum or something like that
Because of the discomfort i had in having them on my ears i rated it low, for quality i would say its a 4 star product
I was excited to try these since I read good reviews about them
They sound pretty good
The bass is good, but the mids are slightly muddy which causes it to sound a little distant and muffled
Despite that I would have love to have kept them because they are better than a lot of other earbuds
However, trying to the replace the eartips is a pain
I followed the manufactures suggestion to freeze the entire earbuds (yes you read that right freeze the electronics, but not for the 24 hours the manufacturer suggested) It worked, however, after they warm up the eartips get to tight again again
After couple of eartip swaps, literally 3 hours after I opened the box, the plastic nozzle connecting the earbud to the eartip broke off
I can't justify replacing this item since the plastic is so brittle
Awesome
They sound good, clarity is good, bass is ok, if you want more bass buy the better SE earbuds
but for $90-100, it cant be beat
It does deaden a lot of outside noise as well
I let my singer try them when I got em, he popped them in and sang 2 words, immediately stopped, said "Wow, holy $***", jumped to amazon
com and asked "What ones are those
Im getting them now
"We run them thru a Behringer 4ch headphone amp and run 1/8" ext cords along with guitar cables
wtf, your tethered anyway
and they work perfect
So for those of you on the fence about IEMs vs monitors, quit being a wuss and climb over, the grass IS greener on the other side
but
these are not typical typical earbuds
It takes a few days to get acclimated to their unique shape and fit
The payoff though is great sound
More importantly they excel at blocking out external noise
whether in the office so I can concentrate, in the yard mowing, and yes, on occassion to mute snoring
I highly recommend them - as long as the person knows it takes a bit of time to adjust
Don't bother spending more for the higher Shure SE models
These sound balanced and accurate and sound isolating is definitely the way to go
I use these while I work (desk job) and on Sundays when performing
The only caution I can provide is that it's generally not a good idea to wear these anywhere where hearing outside ambient noise is beneficial
(e
g
jogging, driving, etc
) -- as these are extremely good at blocking outside noise
One really nice improvement (over my black SE215 copy) was that they finally added a plastic grid/mesh slightly inside the foam piece
This prevents earwax from getting into the actual ear piece
Now earwax is confined and far easier to clean/deal with
Having trouble figuring out which one ear piece belongs in which ear; left or right
I had originally found it annoying that I couldn't see/read the "L" and "R" on each earpiece like I could on my black pair
but that was only until I discovered that each ear piece has a color coded "dot" indicating left and right channel
(red for right, blue for left)
It also doubles as the point where you need to line up the ear piece should you wish to replace the cable
The behind ear design is ridiculous
The mic version cable is very thin and flimsy and was clearly not designed to go behind the ear
Therefore the cable does not stay behind the ear and starts flopping around
This is as good as trash
I miss my SE115
I got these the other day an I was a little skeptical because I like good bass and also being able to hear good highs
Typically you either get one or the other
Shure NAILED this product
These are amazing
I can play my acoustic and sing and the highs will come out great or play bass on them and get the lows
I LOVE THESE
If you are hesitant like I was, Just pull the trigger and buy them
You will not be disappointed
I spent $100 dollars on a nice pair of headphones for the first time in a long time
Not 15 minutes into listening to music does the left earbud  completely stop working
Although I am sure the return policy will be straight forward, I will now have to deal with returning these and not having headphones for a couple of days
Way to go Shure, you lost another customer
Short and sweet
Sound quality is good, not 100 bucks good, but good
Incredibly annoying design, constantly slips out when Im running
Very annoying to put back in
The whole loop over the ear thing is ridiculous
I would not buy this design again, but if they had a more straight forward in the ear design Id consider it
i bought them because my old earbuds died on me
i really thought the removable ending was a great feature
which i still thing the idea is great
but simply getting them to fit in your ear is a hassle and the way they wrap around (when you FINALLY do get them in your ear) just feels unnatural
they do what they're supposed to do
but i think this purchase has made it clear that these 'type' of earphones are not for me at all
work well, easy to use, easy to carry around, no issues at all
Work as advertised
I like the fact they are very compact
would recommend to others
I actually do NOT like the heavy 'memory' wire cord
It's a little too stiff
I have the SE425's too, which are twice the price and have 3 drivers and sound 3x better
They also have the crappier cord which makes them harder to insert
Since they aren't easy in and easy out, I don't wear these as much as I'd like because of that
The Sure equivalent w/o the memory wire gets much more use
I can't wear earbuds
If they fit my left ear they don't fit my right ear
These fit both ear perfectly and are comfortable for up to two hours
After that I need a little break
They also stay put when running
Sound is Excellent
I haven't tried any $150 plus IEMs but these beat the pants off everything at lower price points
Good clarity and a wide sound stage for such a small design
Its not as punchy in the base as I'd like but the mids and highs are distinct and crystal clear
Although the base is very much affected by how far I push the rubber part into my ear
Too far and it sounds basier but gets uncomfortable fast
I lost 1 pair and bought a replacement about a week later
Couldn't be without them and wasn't willing to risk buying a competitor
I am surprised that this earphone didn't eork for me
I aas counting so much on its brand name
The sound is very thin and broken
My husband used it for his game but he wasn't also happy for another reason that it don't hold up well
I wished I had the time to return it
I use these to sing with at church and I can't hardly hear anything that isn't going through the speakers
Sometimes good, sometimes bad 
But I can hear the music really well, so it's great to sing with
Today I received my SE215's from Amazon
Sadly, I am disappointed
The first issue is one of quality control on Shure's part
Many reviewers have mentioned issues with the left earbud cutting out and this was the case with the pair that I received
I really like the idea of being able to replace the cable on a set of headphones, however I think this design is what ultimately leads to so many issues with loss of signal
The issue is definitely in the cable and not the earbuds themselves
I tried to isolate the issue by removing and reconnecting the cable, I also tried swapping the left/right connections
The issue was intermittent and there were times when I thought I had solved the issue, but it always returned
These earbuds do sound good, but not enough to justify the price
Many reviewers have commented on the bass response
Proper fit is essential for bass response in any earbud
Overall, I felt that the sound was very balanced and clean
The thing that impressed me most was the stereo separation which in my opinion is the closest to over-the-ear headphones that I have experienced with an in-ear monitor
I'm going to return the Shure SE215 for a refund and just keep enjoying my pair of Panasonic RPHJE120K ($7
18 from Amazon) that I received for Christmas
Bottom Line:1)  Great balanced sound and stereo separation
2)  Proper fit is the key to good sound and bass response
2)  Concerns about Shure quality control
3)  The replaceable cable is a gimmick that is going to lead to problems down the road
I would not recommend this product
noise cancellation is greatsound is clear, treble and midsbass is good but not greatoverall good valuegreat for running bc they dont fall outbest ear buds ive ever owned
I work as a scopist (a person who edits legal transcripts for court reporters) and use buds daily
I was looking for a comfortable set to replace the ones I had worn out
Sound is VERY important since I need to hear exactly what's going on in depositions and trials, and these fit that bill perfectly in that regard
The sound IS great
However, they drove me nuts
I hated the over-the-ear wire
I was very awkward
I wear glasses and it was frustrating to get that wire to stay put
The buds kept falling out (and I tried several sizes) and the wire annoyed me
I couldn't just pop 'em in and go
I had to adjust them each time
No thanks
I don't have time for that
I got the Bose IE2 instead and LOVE them
The sound is amazing and I don't even feel them in my ears
Easy in, easy out
Good luck to you all in your search
I have been buying Shure for years, but this product is disappointing, The ear pieces themselves are great, but the movement of the cables is audible inside the earphones and it sounds a bit like having your ear scraped with a wire brush
This was annoying both in a gym setting and at the office (you could hear the cable rubbing against the desk)
These are my first headphones in this price range
They're better than my old favorite, the sony mdr-60ex
Bass is amazing
They are very comfortable
They are also possible to wear when trying to sleep sideways
I use them while doing homework, working out, and well just everything
The ONLY thing I don't like is that the cable is rather long
I like the shape, color and strong wire
The rub makes me a little uncomfortable but it really does a good job in sound isolation
As for the acoustical quality, it does not give me much surprise than my old cheaper Sennheiser
I was apprehensive at first but I am now a loyalist the design to the foam plugs is exceptional
The way it firmly comfortably fits in my ear without constant fixing
The sound is WoW good mods highs and lows
I have become a shure customer for life although the prices are a little steep
Looked at so many headphones, even the bose noise cancelling headphones and earphones
Honestly, the 215s are not noise cancelling but with music on, YOU CANNOT HEAR ANYTHING BUT YOUR MUSIC
It does a great job at giving you a great music experience
The 215s are lasting, durable, great sound highs and lows, and they are cheap compared to bose
a few years ago I had a set of Shure E series ear buds, and they were great
I lost them somewhere and, so wanted to replace them, so i went with Shure again
Problems are twofold
ONe,  These new ones  have cheap foam and rubber ear pieces which don't stay in as well as the old silicone ones and don't block sound as well
Two:  for some reason shure thought putting thick plastic sleeves on the wire closest to the ear would allow the user to mold the wire to fit over the ear
This would be great if they held the position, but they don't
they just make them hard to put on and uncomfortable to wear with glasses
they also seem to get tangled very easily when you put them away
It's nice that sure decided to make the wires removeable for when they  go bad and the pivot at the point of attachment would seem prevent the the metal fatigue that probably caused the older non-pivoting style to fail; but between the tangles, fall outs and discomfort  I simply couldn't wear them for more than 15 min at a time
I just returned them
I love these in ear headphones
I live in Texas and I run 3-4 times per week with the headphones
The sound is great and the cord is longer than other brands I've owned
It takes a while to get the cord and ear piece to fit perfectly
Therefore, I gave it 4 stars but it is more like 4
5 stars
I'm not much of an audiophile, but I've started buying and using headphones from different companies like JLab, Ultimate Ears, and Shure
These are far and away the best earbuds I've ever owned in my life
The sound quality is perfectly balanced, the noise isolation is amazing, the cord doesn't tangle or break, the fit is the most comfortable I've ever experienced, and they don't leak sound
Replaceable chord and earbuds are just icing on the cake
If you aren't sure about whether or not to buy these, I promise that you will not be disappointed
I bought these headphones, because I moved into a new space at work
The new space has surprisingly loud A/C units running full time
Sony and Bose noise cancelling headphones were unable to significantly reduce the noise
These earbuds include 6 pairs of sleeves: three sizes, one set in foam and one in rubber
The foam sleeves are exactly like foam earplugs
They do a great job of expanding to fill your ear canal and block a great deal of noise - even without music playing
These can take a little while to get used to
I've been sleeping with this type of earplug for years and had no difficulty acclimating to these
The sound is great
They sound significantly better than my slightly more expensive Sony noise cancelling headphones
As other reviewers have noted, the noise isolation is so complete that you should not use these in an environment where they might cause a safety issue
For me, I had to invest in a mirror for my desk
I didn't like how easily people snuck up on me
Others didn't like the fact that they could be talking to me for quite some time before realizing that I hadn't heard a word
:)
noise cancellation is greatsound is clear, treble and midsbass is good but not greatoverall good valuegreat for running bc they dont fall outbest ear buds ive ever owned
I've paid more for earbuds that have not performed as well as these Shure earbuds
The earbuds are comfortable once the proper fit is established with the various sizes supplied
Quality of the cables and the buds are heavy duty and durable
Have already used the buds for air travel on some longer flights noting exceptional cancelling of outside noise and excellent comfort
Not a peep from any outside noise
Sound is Crystal clear
Bass is so important to me so this was a no brainer
Tricky to fit in ear at first but then it's easy after you get it
Great buy
Great company
Bought these over a year ago at this point and have been using them daily
I am very rough with things, and have been impressed with how long these have lasted (most headphones only last me 4-5 months max)
Excellent sound quality as well
I couldn't recommend these more
It comes with a variety of sleeves, I found the large foam ones the most comfortable
It takes a while to get used to putting them on, just know that youll spend 10-15 seconds just fitting them into your ears, but its definitely worth it
Incredible sound and isolation, awesome build quality, very ergonomic
Very cheap and i buy again, totally recommend this earbuds, bye
These earphones are perfect
Since they block out virtually all sound, I can leave my volume low to save battery life and still have tons of sound
Also good for studying if you just want to block out the sound of those around you (in a cafe or pub) without having to put in actually earplugs
For the price, I highly recommend these earphones to anyone
These are awesome for the musician who wants to give in-ears a shot
They're loud, they isolate well, and they fit pretty nice
The pack of buds offer rubber fittings in 3 sizes and foam plugs in 3 sizes
if you like to use the "ear-plug" style, i suggest ordering more tips
they can be had for around $15 for 5 more pairs
these are also great for just listening to music on
I didn't expect them to be such hard to fit
My ears are not large at all, but the part used to fix the plugs on ear is too short, making it really hard to fit
They are good quality
Only negative is the buds are too big for my very small ear canals
An optional size bud available would be nice
I purchased the Shure SE215-K headphones a little over a week ago and have been overall happy with them
Two minor issues:1) The plastic part of the L-plug is too large in diameter for these to fit in my portable devices with a case on them
Neither my Galaxy Note nor my Tablet
2) they take a little practice putting them on
It's taken me a while to get where I can put them on one-handed as they really need to be seated in your ear canal for best sound
The different sized ear pieces help, but they do take a little of practice put them on easily
That said, I really like the sound
it's even and doesn't have any of the harshness I found in a lot of small driver in-ear headphones
Sound is good
Right bud stopped working in less than 2 months
Not happy
Buying earbuds again----will not be Shure
The sound quality of these earmuffs may be outstanding but the sheer size and awkward feeling when wearing them really limits their use
Not headphones I would wear while engaged in any physical activity or on the move
These sounded wonderful while they were working
I have had previous generations of Shure earbuds which I preferred, a little more even in response (and didn't give up the ghost so easily)
These are a little bass-heavy for me, but plenty of people love that about them
I have tried many different sets of earbuds in the 100-150 dollar range and, in terms of sound, Shure is really as good as it gets
Problem is, the left side started cutting out after using them moderately for LESS THAN A WEEK
Cable issues, as several here have noted
Returned
A broken product is a broken product
I would normally give 1 star, but must give 2 because they do sound great
She said it was one of her favorite gifts
All day long Christmas day she kept the in her ears
They sound amazing and fit great
looking forward to buying more pairs of them for the rest of the crew
For in ear headphones
these are by far the best
im a huge adiophile when it comes to loud music
Im a big fan of the cambridge soundworks bookshelfs speakers hooked up to my denon
I have some bose and beyer headphones that are over ear stereo types
and these are for when i travel
first part, the headphones come apart from the actual cord
why is this good
well when your cord wears out or it gets cut somehow, you dont need a new pair, you just need the cord
The hadphones if put in properly with the wire around the ear, are phenomenal and even hours of plane use from NYC to london, these wont hurt your earsThe bass and just overall quality of the sound is superior
I also can blast them in a public area without anyone around me hearing a thingi had a pair of the 435s or something and my puppy at the time chewed those up
since i have bought these and they sound amazing as well
GO FOR IT
The sound is good, not excellent, before these I was using a similar sennheiser the price was the same, but the sound much better
Top of the line quality of sound and great noise isolation
I put these on and I can't here the person next to me talking, let alone the noise on the airplane
The memory foam earbuds make all the difference
It takes some getting used to to put these on correctly, and after about a week of use, I still struggle a little to put them on in the dark
Also, the included ear tips didn't fit me very well, medium was a bit too small and the large was a bit too large
I also purchased Comply Tx100 at the same time and with Comply ear tips, all is grand
I had been using Klipsch S4 for a few years until my new puppy chewed them up
These are definitely a step up from Klipsch S4
Twice as expensive as S4, but I feel it's worth it
I had them on during a business trip and they were comfortable and blocked almost all of the airplane noise
I also have Bose QC15 and they are awesome at canceling airplane engine noise, but a bit too bulky and does not block out crying babies
For $100, can't beat the price or the sound quality
The sound quality is a bit disappointing
It lacks clarity
In addition, there is also cable noise when it it touched which is annoying
For about the same price, you can get a much better sound from headphones such as Audio Technica's M50
On the other hand, the noise isolation and build quality seem good
Stopped working after 6 months of light use
Now the left ear will stop playing music intermittently but come back on if I jiggle the headphones around a little
Annoying for such an expensive product
Bought these as a replacement for some my wife had that died after a few years of using while running
This new pair is solid and sound terrific
I have used Klipsch, Bose, and these Shure, and these are some of the best sounds headphones I had used
Deep bass, and tight fit
once you get them in just right, which can be a challenge at times, but once you get used to putting them in, and bend the wire just right, they go right in
I recently purchased the Shure SE215-K as a Christmas gift
I must say on the behalf of the receipient that it far exceeded it's reviews
Was very pleased with purchase
The sound quality is excellent, and it's perfect on the train - I cannot hear a thing
With many cheap headphones that means turning the music up very high
With these I don't have to
I'm very happy with these
For $100, these sound amazing and do a great job of blocking out ambient sound
They are comfortable in my ears for hours at a time and stay firmly in place thanks to the cables that wrap behind your ears
I will reiterate that these really sound fantastic
The only catch is that the cable built quality is poor
This is the third pair of Shure earphones I have purchased and the cables invariably fail within a year of purchase
One earphone or the other will start to cut out when the cable is twisted in a certain way and then eventually that earphone cuts out all together
I had them replaced via Shure's warranty one time and bought a replacement cable the other two times
It is very nice that the cables are replaceable independent of the earbuds, but the replacement cables are about 1/3 the cost of the whole earphone set and you have to go through the hassle of ordering and replacing them
These are great earphones, but I really wish they would fix the cable issue or offer cheaper replacement cables
It suits my needs perfectly
I wasn't certain when I ordered it but I am now 100ercent sold on it
The noise canceling and isolation work so well, I can't hear people talking a few feet away from me
Sound quality is great, with audible bass but not too much
6 different ear inserts mean it should fit just about anyone, but the standard size has worked for everyone I know
The cable is long, very durable and replaceable
It takes a little getting used to because the cables go forward, then up and over your ears, unlike most earbuds that just dangle
I've owned these for almost a year now, and enjoy the sound quality just as much now as I did on the first day
They have held up very well during the time I've had them, and I use them everyday and sometimes in rough conditions; the single sign of wear is that the "SHURE" logo on the side has faded slightly
The comfort level is fine, as they are made to be molded to your ear and hold that position fairly well over time
In terms of relative sound quality, these out-perform anything at a similar price range, Bose included (in my opinion)
A note on the earpieces: I use the stock round silicone ones occasionally, and these are fine for most use
However, I recommend buying the triple-flanged earpieces from Shure if you are after noise-isolation (search Shure EATFL1-6, they should be about $8 and are well worth it)
I have a pair of Shure SE 425s that broke
While waiting to get them fixed, I need a backup set of IEMs
I saw these 215s and since I love my 425s, I figured these couldn't be too bad and at 99 dollars, seemed worth my time
Definitely a good purchase
Like the 425s, the cord for these is detachable, which is great because usually I destroy cables pretty quick by snagging them on something or just bending the wires inside too much from use
The sound is great
Now, I am not a full-bore audiophile
I don't listen to only lossless tracks directly made from the master recordings of artists
But I do listen to a LOT of music and like my music enough to know that ipod earbuds are awful and cause you to lose so much texture of music
The 215s help ensure that does not happen
While they are not as natural-sounding as the 425s, the quality is still great
Sometimes the bass may be a bit heavier than it should be but it definitely not anywhere close to too heavy and, at the price point, quite good
If you want a decent IEM without breaking the bank and don't care about absolute "perfect" sound translation, these are a very good choice
Tip:  The foam tips that come with these make my ears hurt
And the silicone tips never seal right
I know this is not an issue for everyone, but if it is for you, I recommend getting some custom tips made
There are numerous sites you can find online that will make these using either a home impression kit or one make by an audiologist
I have a set for my 425s and they are super comfortable and create a great seal for excellent sound
It's clear that the attachment points between the earpiece and the cord degrade over time and cause some cutting in and out of the audio
This can get very annoying, and I will update this review when I buy a new cord and try them again
The sound is absolutely great, though, and they do a nice job of isolating you from the noise of the outside world
I use them regularly on wingsuit skydives, and I get a little wind noise but my tunes sound nice
Despite my limited experience with other brands, I'd say these will beat the rest at similar price points
Second pair of higher end Shure IEMs and I'll keep buying them despite the little snag with the cord
Delivers great sound and ear buds stay nicely in ears
They provide a nice carrying case and extra ear cuffs
These are fantastic sound isolating in ear monitors
Great for when you want the outside world to just stay out
Bought these for someone else
I tried them and the sound quality was very good as well as the noise isolation
It wasn't complete but to 35dcb
Therefore only could rate a 4
Also a little clumsy getting them adjusted to your ear
These have great treble response, extremely detailed, but are a little lacking in the bass unless you insert them so far they touch your brain
Fitment is fantastic
eventually
I spent probably 2 months fiddling with the little form-able wires, trying 4 different ways of wearing the headphones, all which proved to be not quite as good as the normal way
But once you figure out the right way to wear them, and get the wires formed to your ears, they're some extremely comfortable earbuds, and thats from someone who seriously hates earbuds
The flexible wire wraps around your ear and really holds them on while youre doing other activities, though I probably wouldn't take them running, because the connector doesn't look very water/sweat resistant
They're holding up relatively well after 1
5+ years, which is longer than my earbuds have ever survived during daily use
The 1/8" jack is incredibly sturdy, and the headphones cords themselves seem to have some sort of metal braided protection in the insulation
However these have developed a minor issue which comes and goes
Something inside the right earbud is rattling, or pinging
It's almost like the little teeny wire inside the clear plastic earbud is being plucked like a guitar string
It happens when I move my head into certain positions, like if I tilt to the right and then back up
Fiddling with it usually makes it go away, or sometimes I just hold my head still, but it is very annoying and might indicate the earbud is about to fail, but if my track record is anything I'll loose them before I hit the 2 year mark
Well first off I am no audiophile so probably couldn't tell teh difference between Mozart and Cher
Well maybe those two but I'm no professional
Saying that I think the sound they produce is pretty good
I also liked my Skull Candy Titans but they seem to keep hiding on me
Now for the design
Figuring out how to install them took a while
Yes I used the work install instead of put them in because that seems more appropriate
After doing it a couple times though it seems easy enough
I normally just used the regular ones you just push in the ears so the wrapping the cord around the ear part took some trial and error
In the questions there were some concerns about using them with glasses
While I would think they would be a big problem based on how they fit, they are not
They seem to work just fine with glasses
Phone cases
This is one area I had a problem
The case on my phone and tablet did cause some issues though
The jack does not fit them
I already had a solution though for my tablet which was a short 3 inch male to male cable with a female to female adapter on the end
Adds some bulk to the cable but otherwise works ok
It would be better if they could redesign the plug to have more clearance
If the plug was designed better I would probably give them 4
5 stars
If they didnt wrap behind the ears I would give them 5 stars
The shape is bulky and awkward in the ear
The cord is so stiff that the sound of the music was drowned out by the sound of plastic shifting around
The bass was completely missing from the music and the treble was nauseating
WORST EAR BUDS EVER
I'll have to go back and buy a replacement pair of Bose, even though the Bose cord is cheap and flimsy
If only Bose could use a stronger cord, like these but without the stiff part near the earpiece, I'd be in luck
oh well
Great sound for the money
Only complaint is that you have to wrap around the top of your ear,  so using for jogging is a pain,  as the cord is a little stiff and so they don't stay in that well
But otherwise awesome value
Shure is an trusted audio company that produces fantastic products, and offers a 2 year limited warranty on their in-ears
The SE215's are a great option for the $100 price point
Since they block out so much noise, they are great for commuting, working in noisy areas, or for on-stage performance
PROS- Great sound
Can't stress that enough
- Great noise isolation
Comes with 3 foam and 3 rubber earbuds (in S, M, and L sizes of each type)
These earbuds block out up to 37 decibels of sound, with the foam being more effective
Because they isolate so well, I do not (and would not recommend) wearing these while exercising or in any circumstance where you need to hear what is going on around you
- Solid cable construction
The cable is sturdier near the ear (so it doesn't break from wrapping the wire behind the ear)
The cable is also detachable at the earpiece so you can replace a cable/earpiece cheaper
- They stay once you get them on
I have had trouble with in-ear headphones staying in my ear for long periods of time, but these fit well and stay put
Wrapping the cord behind your ear helps a lot with this
CONS- Changing the earbuds
I had a lot of trouble getting the Medium foam earbuds off initially
I would recommend using you fingernail to slowly and carefully slide off the earpiece
Removing the foam earbuds is more difficult than the rubber ones
- Achy ear canals
After wearing the buds for an hour or so my ear begins to ache a bit
They fit snugly in the ear, which is what blocks out so much of the noise around you
A bit of aching is a price I am willing to pay though
FINAL THOUGHTSThese in-ear earbuds are the best I have ever used
I ended up changing to the rubber small earpieces and love the fit
Some people recommend a burn-in period of 20+ hours before these work to their true potential, but I have not noticed any difference after many hours of listening
sound good but I expected a little more from them, I have had hearing aids that have a price less than or equal improved performance
example, the ear pods
It could just be me
I didn't quite know how to modify the ear buds to fit in the right direction in my ears
The sound seems to be amazing, but I struggled so much with the ear phones that I had no choice but to send it back
Poor quality, they worked for only one run on the tread mill and the left ear stopped working
These earphones were made for runner, guess they didn't tell the guys putting them together
The Klipsch and Beats ear phone are still working strong and sound great after many workouts
Don't buy the Shure they are not worth the money
Despite trying every ear insert, the ear buds would not seal to form the sound isolating experience I was wanting
I returned these headphones
If you have an iPhone case, most likely the plug will not fit in
I called Sure and they blamed Apple for sending the wrong specs, but the iPhone 5 has been out for over a year and they have not taken the time to fix the problems
They sent a cheep extender that will fit, but it is just another wire to break
Overall great headphones for the price, amazing isolation
Isolation:Superb
They isolate more than the Vic First Drumming headphones, which isolated very well
Instead of muffling the highs like the Vics, These cut out most of the bass
My kick sounds completely flat with no low end while wearing these
This is great, because when you're monitoring or playing with music, you don't get all the muddy noise, but you can still hear the attacks from your kit through the seals
You can always monitor your kit and get the low end back that way
Sound:Very bassy, not in the muddy way, but in the deep way
They get really low, powerful frequencies instead of just amplifying most of the low end like a lot of cheaper headphones, which muddies up the sound
Still, these are very bassy
Weird thing:The foam ear tip was super hard to take off the earphone to the point where I was worried that I would break them
No damage, but it's tough to get off/on
i bought these earphones to use when I drum
After having them for some time now, I want to say that these are great
work great at insulating the sound of the drums in my ears
I like how they feel around my ears, and have no problem with them
music coming thru them sounds great
I always wanted a great pear of earphones for drumming with, now I got them
and I am happy
get these if you are tight on budget
these earphones are AMAZING for this price
I would recommend these
I expected better because of the good reviews
Overall it's a great pair of earphones with excellent build quality, would definitely recommend
I'm no audiophile, but even I can tell the difference between these and other "less expensive" ear buds
I was amazed at the sound quality out of the box and did my own listening test vs
several other pairs of ear buds that I have
First pair test vs
the Shure were relatively cheap $20 Skull Candy
No comparison
Second pair tested were Bose IE2
Closer to discern between the Bose and the Shure, but the SE215-K is clearer, crisper and rich deep tones
The last pair that I tested was the Samsung phones that come with a Galaxy S4 smart phone
Again, no comparison, Not even close
The only downside was it was a bit difficult to change to try a different type of sleeves
It took a little time and patience to figure out, but ultimately not too bad if done carefully
They fit great and feel great wearing them
I never tried the over the ear style before, but they are really comfortable and secure
I've only had them a couple of weeks, but they work well for every use I've used, from walking to riding my motorcycle and using them with my Sena SMH10 Bluetooth com system
Got these as a birthday present about a year ago and just love them
Also currentlyown Beats sports earbuds (the red ones) and the sound on the Shure blows away the Beats
I love the design, the snug fit and the quality of the sound
I hear things I never knew existed in the song
The reason I came on line was to look at upgrading - and am considering the higher end Shure
I understand the negatives people write about but put it this way - the negatives on these are mere inconveniences - personally, I can't think of a negative
Just buy them and you'll understand
I run an hour at good speed 4 days a week - work up a sweat and have no problems with these (as compared to almost every other "sport earbud" I've purchased)
I don't ever write reviews but i had to when my wife put my jeans in the washer with my SE215s in the pocket
These headphones survived a full wash and dry cycle
I plugged them in right out of the machine thinking they were dead
To my surprise they came on
I am somewhat picky when it comes to sound, but i could not detect any loss of quality
Really happy with these indestructible bastards
Bought these and Beats
I ended up returning the Beats
My BF owns a pair of Bose earbuds
Comparing all 3, I thought the Shure earbuds outperformed both Beats & Bose
Awesome, awesome sound & quality
I Absolutely love these
Pros: Great sound, incredible noise isolation, long cable, great memory foam ear tips with lots of size compatibility, very good fit, very comfortable, best earphones I have ever had
Better that Powerbeats and Klipsch Custom 3'sCons: Maybe cable length, noise isolation is very good making these possibly unsafe for outdoor useI looked at a lot of earphones and I am really glad I went with these
Perfect for working out
They never fall out of my ears or even come loose
Also very sweat and moisture resistant
I bought these for durability and decent sound quality
I wasn't expecting the best sound from them but wanted something on par with Klipsch Image S4's
After trying multiple different ear piece sizes and listining to them for 5 days I finally gave up
They don't sound as good as the $37 Sony MDR-EX210's I've been using for the past month
let alone the image S4's
They lack any mid range sound performance and have no bass except for extreme low notes (rare in most music even rap)
The main reason I bought these was the durability
Aparently Shure failed here too as the left side intermittently cuts out a few times a day and has since day one
I was hoping to have a decent sounding pair of earbuds that would survive the abuse of being used 8 hours a day for over 6 months
My past 4 pairs of $70-100 headphones have all failed near the cord connection to earbud, the cable, or from liquid
At least those earbuds sounded good for almost a year before they broke
These were a failure from the begining
This is the best product that I have ever put in my ears
I have owned everything from beats to bose
These top them all
I would really suggest buying them and dropping the rest
The cord is extra thick and doesn't like to tangle
great
I lead worship at my church and I am somewhat of an audiophile
I love these headphones
The bass and clarity is great, and they don't need to be burned in
This is my second pair because my old ones got thrown in the wash - 4 times might I add
They worked until then
Great headphones
they sound pretty good, not great
the problem is the ear buds keep comimg out and ive tried all the different sizes
these earphones have been great for the gym
they are comfortable and have a durable construction
i would recommend these for anyone looking for comfy earbuds that stay in your ears
Following the death of an older pair of earphones and the purchase of the "updated" version (I
E
far worse), I decided it was time to upgrade
I've got a preference for open-ear headphones/earphones because of the improved sound stage they typically offer, but this time around, I was after something with a lot of noise isolation
People instantly suggested noise cancelling headphones and earphones, which made me laugh
Active cancellation is horrible
To the point, though
After two months of looking, I opted to pick up the SE-215s
Out of the box, the fit wasn't great, but I expected this
Still, I listened to them for an hour with the stock ear-tips, so I can confirm something I've been seeing: without the right fit, these are not going to feel like they're worth $100
The noise isolation doesn't work very well, and the sound quality suffers
Get the right tips on them, and it's a different story
After throwing on the biggest tips, things started looking up quickly
With very little volume from my tablet (A Nexus 7, which is their primary source), I couldn't hear anything around me at all
At half volume, a loud basketball game may as well have not been going on
Get the right tips, and the isolation WILL follow
In fact, I've seen people mention that you don't want to use these in places where you need to be able to hear some of what's going on around you, and they're right
The isolation is crazy
Another point of these I've seen discussed is the fit
People keep mentioning the "Shure fit
"  This comes back down to the tips you have on your earphones
If you have the wrong tips, they're not going to be very comfortable
With the right tips, however, they almost vanish into my ears
Unless I pay close attention, I can pretty easily forget that they're there, though I'm very prone to spending long periods of time (upwards of six hours with minimal breaks) with headphones/earphones on/in
As such, I'm used to long-duration wear
Still, with the right tips, these are very comfortable
Not once have I had to take them out because they were bothering me, even after sleeping in them for a full 9 hours
(On that note, if you want a pair of earphones to sleep in, these also work great
They sit deep in the ear with a minimal profile on the outer ear, so it's possible to lay on them and feel no discomfort
May not work well for people with small ears, though
)What about the sound
Again, this is dependent on the tip you have
Get the right tip, and the trinity (isolation, comfort, and sound) show up at the same time
People complain that these are bass-heavy, and I agree to a point
These earphones are not in any way neutral
The bass does come through strongly enough to make the mids feel thin and the highs muffled
That being said, it's nowhere near as bad as those abominations known as Beats
Music is still very easy to listen to and enjoy, and unless you're a big fan of Grado and Sennheiser, I'm not sure you'd really feel that the bass was overpowered at all
The attribute that takes the biggest hit is vocals, but again, that's coming from Grado and Sennheiser, both of which are very, very good at bringing out all parts in the mix equally
Continuing to focus on the tips, changing them is a royal pain in the ass the first time
I nearly ruined the default pair trying to get them off
It's going to take a while, so don't rush it
Literally took me 20 minutes to get both sides changed out
Overall, I strongly suggest these
They do exactly what I wanted them to do with ease, and for $100, I'm not sure how much better it could have been done
The cables are detachable, and if you want, you can get cables to use them with your iPhone or Android phone
Can't comment on the functionality of either, as I despise iPhones and don't have the cash for a decent Android phone right now
On an unrelated note, I wish these were waterproof
I actually don't like taking them out first thing in the morning to go and nab a shower
It's nothing worth complaining about, though it's the only thing I think they could improve on in this price range
As far as better sound quality goes, I'm not sure what to say other than to jump up to the SE-425s or higher
I  got my NEW 215 clear at a retail store, and after reading so many reviews and comments about this inear phone
I thought I should also give my comments too
I had 2 SHURE inear phones few years ago, "E" series mostly the lower-end ones
those with cables that cannot be detact
They all lasted about 1
5years all with the same problem
damaged cables
resulting in failing on one side of the earphone
I did not get a replacement since it was after the warranty period, but the SHURE customer service was kind enough to explain to me that the damage was due to wear and tear + humidity & constant shifting of the cables at the end of the jacks
I felt it was a pity that the cable were damaged but the speakers and components on the earphones were still good
But I was not able to afford the highend series of SHURE with detactable cables
years ago; those were expensive
Now when I saw 215 with detactable cables I was very pleased
An entry level earphones with detactable cables is some thing not seen
This is a cool feature that cannot be found in entry levels
I could change the cables if damage
making it last much more
The one draw-back I found after I got the 215 is that it really took me a while to wear them
Another issue that I had not thought of
my  prescription glasses
The E series had softer cables & without any metal wire in the cable that loop over my ear
so it did not get in the way of my glasses, but the 215 cable (the cable to loop over my ear) have thicker and are wired with a thin piece of bandable metal
this WILL GET IN THE WAY with prescription glasses
So beware
But I still think that the pros of the 215 out weight the cons
Too bad that I have not realized that about the cables getting in the way of and my glasses, but I have to live with it as I want a inear phone with detactable cable
I have had my SE215 earbuds for over a year and still love them
When I compare my earbuds to earbuds friends have bought for more then $250, my earbuds sound better all around
Their earbuds sound more crisp at the higher frequencies, but overall the whole sound experience is better with mine
The base on the SE215 is really good, haven't found any earbuds that sound better, base wise, then mine for around the same price
The quality base is the most noticeable thing I hear when I compare my earbuds to more expensive, non-Shure brand, earbuds
Before I bought my SE215's I was really worried about all the reviews that say the cables go bad after a short time
Mine still have no problems whatsoever and I have been listening to them for at least 2 hours a day for over a year
I take really good care of my earbuds and I use the carrying case whenever I transport them
I even through them into my laptop bag everyday on my way to work and still haven't had any issues
Bottom line, if you are wondering whether to get these headphones, just get them
You will not be disappointed
After listening to my SE215's I have had friends go buy a pair the next day because of how much they loved the sound quality of these earbuds for the sub $100 price
Cons: The only complaint I have about these headphones is they can be a little uncomfortable after wearing them for more then three hours
I never have had a problem with my right ear, but my left ear will start to get sore after about three hours and if I leave them in for more then six or seven hours I will have to remove the earbud from my left ear because it can really start to hurt
I don't listen to them for more then four hours very often, so it isn't a big deal
Even with this problem I would still buy another pair in a heartbeat because the quality sound that is produced from these headphones is amazing
Also, I wouldn't recommend these headphones if you are looking for something to wear while sleeping
Last note, I have a sound system at home with Sonas Faber Toy Towers and a REL T-9 sub
I bought this sound system for listening to music and not home theater (though the T-9 is geared for home theater)
I've listened to other high end music sound systems, including the Alexandria 2 from Wilson, and can easily hear the difference between these high end systems and other systems
You can definitely get earbuds that sound better then the SE215's, but the only earbuds I've ever heard that sound better are the higher end Shure earbuds and other brand earbuds that are well over $200 dollars
Hope this review helps
(Review copied from previous Amazon account)
This is my second pair of Shure in-ear monitors
The first endured five years of heavy use before the cable failed
I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable
The quality is outstanding
the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me well)
The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble
However, these do have a somewhat forward sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some in-ear monitors convey (Etymotic comes to mind)
That said, I believe 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's
Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed above and behind the ear for a secure fit
This does secure the fit, but can be slightly awkward for glasses wearers
Update: After several years of steady use the Shure CBL-M+K Accessory Music Cable (separate item) that I purchased along with these began to fray and was replaced by Shure, free of charge under warranty
Recently, the earbuds and cable were inadvertently stepped on, breaking the right earbud and the accessory cable
After sending to Shure, they were both replaced for a VERY fair price
With such reliable customer service, I'm a Shure customer for life
I've been using mine heavily for a couple of months now and enjoy them very much
The sound is very good - rich and full, without being too bass heavy
Some kinds of music can spike in the high frequencies (around 4k) but you can fix that with a little bit of EQ
Overall, I have no complaints, just a small warning about getting the foam inserts wet
I used these at the gym once and got sweat on the foam inserts
I figured that since they're supposed to deal with performances, they should be fine for sweat
Not so
Once the foam insert was exposed to sweat, it became very hard to compress the foam before inserting it into my ear
The actual drivers are ok, just the foam
I've order some replacement foam tips and will be sure not to make this mistake again
My wife had a pair of Shure EC3s she purchased in 2006 for $135 and worked great until she left them in the plane on a flight home from Chicago last month
The SE215s are superior in sound qaulity and construction, and just as good in fit and comfort
The zip pouch does not have a spool inside like the EC3s but it works fine
They're exactly what I wanted
They fit perfectly in my ears, and the cost is very reasonable
The sound is very clear
I had a pair of Shure SE115s which I liked very much
Unfortunately, I left them behind on an airplane
Since the 115s are no longer available, I "upgraded" to the 215s
Compared to the 115s, which had strong bass but a very warm overall sound, the 215s sound very tinny to me, more like some $40 Sony earbuds I had a few years back
I just got them I the mail today
They arrived SO FAST and loved them from the start
Very well build and very sturdy
I have gone through so many pairs of crappie headphones in my life
Most break after two or three weeks
So I did a lot of research and found these
The price was a bit scary because I was so use to getting new ones that I thought "wow it's gonna suck if these break"
I took the plunge and bought them after I read tons of reviews all over the net
Well it was worth it
These headphones have no business sounding this good
The tips that came attracted were a bit hard to get off that came preassembled but I just used my teeth lol
They were to small and memory foam which just feels weird so no harm if I damaged those
I just got the HTC ONE and with the beats these are even better
Take the plunge it's worth it
This is the 4th pair of sure headphones that I have purchased in the last 5 or 6 years
I purchased this set for my son for Christmas
He loves them
I have a pair of SE535's that I use, but these sound GREAT
Not quite as punchy as mine, but for 100 bucks you can't complain
They are at least as good as my $300 Bose over the ear headphones
Initially, it did take some effort to get the buds to fit comfortably in my ear
However, once configured properly, these ear buds are comfortable for an extended period of time, and sound amazing
As a owner of an Audio Technica MTH 50, these are perfect in ear headphones
They are worn over the ear, which may be an issue for some
Overall, the quality is amazing, but one may not like how they fit in one's ears
Very good sound at a reasonable price, and am interested in possibly trying one of the more expensive models in the future
Awesome product, great sound and outside noise blocking, took few days to get used to the over ear design but now I love it
Great buy
I have high expectations of Shure but the SE215 didn't wow me in any way
Having said that, it's the first earphone I've owned to get the right mix of all the characteristics I look for in an earphone
I'm more demanding of an earphone than a stay-at-home headphone, it has to do more than stay on my head and sound good
Things like durability, isolation and microphonics, among other things, are important and Shure gets that
Comfort/Design:They were not as comfortable as they looked
It's a personal thing but they literally rubbed me the wrong way, not so much as to be problematic but it dismissed the notion I had of any IEM of this shape being instantly comfortable, something I will think about for future purchases
Still, they were adequate and I would pick an over-the-ear style cable any day
Due to the cable route and the cable itself, microphonic noise is as low as I could reasonably expect
I was not able to comfortably listen to them while lying on my side but your experience may differ
The Shure "Olive" foam tips are comfortable and I found them easy to fit
I've never had the issues some people have with memory foam eartips or earplugs but I still found them easier to handle than most
Contrary to popular opinion, they can be cleaned without entirely losing their performance
The cable jack is solid and properly strain relieved but is bigger than with most other earphones
So much so that most iPhone cases (the ones that cover around the jack) that aren't of the super-thin variety will not allow you to plug your earphones in
Isolation:It will be hard to beat any Shure for isolation at this price point
I can't fault it at all, any more might be dangerous
Durability:With the rave reviews at the time, I had high expectations and my initial impressions were good
It was the best feeling cable of any IEM I've used and it looked rugged enough
It resisted tangling or kinking and felt like it would outlast my other IEMs by far but I was wrong about that last one
My first cable broke at just over half a year and the 2nd cable lasted about that long as well
Both were swiftly repaired under warranty and my final cable lasted an impressive 2 years although at that point, the memory wire had punctured a whole in the heat shrink that at the part of the cable that wraps around your ear
The cable is still better than most of what I've used at this price point but it wasn't all I was lead to believe it would be
It's great that you can replace them yourself but when the cable costs 40% (it used to be more) of the earphone's original price, it's no longer a big feature
I can imagine SE535 owners shelling out the 40 dollars but I don't feel it's worth it for this one
I didn't have many issues with the earpieces themselves although I did crack the housing when removing a stubborn eartip with force
It did not affect the sound
Sound:Shures generally have an inoffensive sound and the SE215 follows that trend
It is a bassy headphone but the bass is controlled better than many other popular offerings at this price point, the Beats come to mind
The bass ends up being the predominant aspect of the SE215's sound but it stops just short of overwhelming the midrange
The treble is rolled-off which contributes to the inoffensive sound but also kills off any airiness the SE215 might have had
It does tend to have a "boxed-in" sound which isn't poor but not impressive
It's not the most energetic earphone but it has enough to keep up with most forms of music
Detail is not the best on this Shure but it has a smooth, warm presentation that I generally find to be quite pleasing
It won't knock you over with its technical ability but the overall presentation is good
If you can enjoy your music for $99 then you should have no problem doing it with the SE215
You can easily find better sounding earphones at this price but you will find it a lot harder to find something that can top the SE215 in all the aforementioned areas
Sonically, it's not a hugely impressive earphone but Shure has created a product that does its job very well
The SE215 is probably the best earphone I've used on the go and for this price, you can't go wrong
I'll start by saying I only awarded 4 stars (so far) simply because I literally just took them out of the box, fitted them to my ears, and have them plugged in just to listen to music right now
I have not yet tested them on stage
However, I'm certain they will be successful in isolating sound well
I sat here while the music was streaming into my ears while just holding the volume button on "up" on another (loud) sound source and I could hear absolutely nothing apart from the music already playing through the headphones
I will say I did not prefer the foam ear plugs to the soft flex sleeves
I liked the easy installation the soft flex sleeves offer-and they were just more comfortable for me
To each his own
it's nice to have all the options
Plus it has a handy carrying case
Anyway, back to the headphone quality
I'm going to give them a major thumbs up
Of course, they're a little heavy in comparison to products by MEElectric or Sony and that of the like
But one should expect that considering how they're made and etc
Do yourself a favor and make the investment if you plan to use them for more than just everyday music listening
I'm glad I did
I'll use them while I sing
If it helps, I also read other reviews where percussionists also recommended these for their own purposes
Enjoy
This product is simply amazing the neat and clear sound with the bass punch that we the bass player like to feels in monitoring
Noise reduction feature is pretty good eliminating that ambient noise
In summary, I Love It
The budget SE115 phones utilize a better dynamic driver, in my opinion at least, than the newer SE215
Shure cheaped out on their new models, and made a worse driver in their SE215 (replacement of the SE115) to save money
Moreover, a lot of people, not just me, on headphone forums agree that the SE115 (and the previous generation of shures, e
g
SE420, SE530) have a much more comfortable fit and seals better, which translates into better sound quality
The SE215 gets 2 stars for looking cool, but the sound quality is nothing without a good fit
Go with the previous generation shures instead (SE115, SE210, SE310, SE420, and my favorite, the SE530/SE530-PTH/E500-PTH)
Warning: If you use these, you will not hear anything outside of your ear buds / music
This is why I absolutely love these ear buds
Work extremely well when you are in a noisy environment and want to hear nothing but your music
The audio quality is better than any other ear bud I have used before
Definitely worth buying
I play drums in a completely enclosed drum booth
Needless to say, I needed a product that would not let on any sound
These are a great set of phones that do not allow any of the exterior drum and cymbal noise to cut into my monitor mix
It's a little odd to wear this style of headphones ( over the ear style) at first
I find that if I run the cord down my back, this makes the cord run in a more natural style (as opposed to running the cord down your chest)
All in all, it's a great product
The one minor complaint is that over time (about 2-3 years) there seems to be an issue with one of the ears cutting in and out
This only happens when the phones are in a very specific position and the cut out is very short
Great product and I will defiantly buy this brand again
I was speculative on the idea of spending so much money on a pair of headphones
When I received them, I frantically put them on and
It was like I was taken away to a island where I was being treated with a personal concert
all dramatics aside, this is one of the best IEM's I've bought in the seven years I've been sound engineering
Definite plus on the construction, especially the mold-able ear loop stress reliefs
I love these so much
When I have them in I seriously cannot hear any outside noise and I love that
The quality is superb and I recommend buying these
I love the sound quality of these earphones but they take a while to mould around your ear for the perfect fit
10x better than those crappy Bose MIE2 and for less
Feels durable and extremely comfortable in your ear
Sound is fantastic, clear, and full of bass
Now, I'll start by saying I'm not an audio-phile
I purchased these after doing research into in ear headphones that are both comfortable and sound good
I can honestly say that I am impressed
I ended up using the foam tips, as they seem to provide a better sound range than the silicone tips
I work in front of a computer all day and I was surprised how I can wear these for 4 hours straight and never have it irritate or hurt my ears
They sound really well for me
I am a bit surprised because I wrote off in ear headphones as always not sounding very good
I'm pleasantly surprised with these
My one con: the sizing on the foam tips included are a little odd
the smallest is slightly smaller than the middle and it is a slightly different shape
The large is a big jump in size from the middle
One of my ears works great for the middle size, and the other makes the middle size feel small
So I don't get a good fit with the middle size
The large size is almost too big for that ear
I use the large size, but it always feels a little odd when I first put them in
I would recommend these for anyone that is looking for good quality in ear headphones and doesn't want to drop 300+ on really nice ones
I received my ear phones the day I left for my trip and one ear piece does not work
So I can't rate this properly as it does not workYogini
I've borrowed these from a friend numerous times and they are very good
The highs are not that clear
I enjoyed listening to a piano or violin piece on the S2 much more just because of that simple fact
The only thing I think they excel in that the Philips lack is the bass
However I do acknowledge that Philips were going for a more "natural" sounding IEM
And I didn't particularly like that you have to take the time to prepare the tips and then insert and get the wire over your ear
I understand it's better for running but I just use my IEMs for the train or walking around
I like the traditional insert in with a silicone tip and not really having to go through the hassle
The reason I took the chance to buy the S2 over these was because my friends shure's starting to break up the sound and it's quite common with them
Though be it the problem only occurred after a year
The replaceable wire design seems to be the cause of this sound breaking up (just forum research)
These are by far the best earbuds ( or in ear monitors) i have ever owned
For starts, i am but a mere high school student
I've used everything from the Skullcandy Heavy Metals to the Beats by Dre
However, i decided that it was time to stop buying swagged up earphones and get a bit more serious about my music
After several weeks of doing my homework, it came down to a couple of choices
A
) Klipsch s4iB
Bose ie2C
) Etymotic hf5D
Shure se215Well, i ended up buying every pair here up until they all eventually failed me, leaving me with nothing but the shure se215
I do not regret purchasing these other earphones as they were all amazing in their own way, however, the pair that eventually worked for me was the shure se215
They are a good mix of all these pairs of earphones and then some
They arent quite as elegant as the etymotics, not quite as comfortable as the bose, and lacking just a little bass when compared to the klipsch
But, this pair is like a jack of all trades with a completely removable cable that never tangles
Unfortunately, they also broke
I was like OH NO, are their no earphones that will  never fail me
However, despite the fact that i did not buy them directly from the website, shure gladly replaced my broken buds, free of charge
It seems that perhaps it wasnt the perfect headphones i was searching for, but the perfect company
Great quality, beautiful range, and once broken in after a few days, very comfortable
If you're looking for good quality headphones with a great sound for fairly cheap, these are great
Also, great for playing video games
I am by no means an audiophile - but these really don't score well in any category
They arrived damaged (tips were crunched beyond repair), and even after replacing them it does not compare to the competition
Comfort- The eartips (foam and otherwise) are a nice inclusion, and they fit well and form a near-perfect seal
However, doing so takes about 15-30s
Each pod is way too large to fit snugly in the ear, and they are way too heavy to wear while walking/jogging really anything else (my headphones did better in this category)
In order to support the earpods, a moldable wire is attached to each, however I found the wire to be too moldable to really provide any support, while the constant adjustment between each use was a drag
Removing each tip was near impossible, and a definite design flaw
Sound-  These are not overwhelming in the sound department
Bass is flat (not "balanced") and creates awkward "resonant noises" even at low volumes
Noise isolation is solid with the foam tips, and mediocre with the silicone ones, (although that is to be expected)
Style- These are pretty much the ugliest things you can get
You will look like you have a hearing aid (with the wire running over your ear)
Design- While the "detachable" earpods are supposedly a bonus, the weak connection left them falling out all the time
The overall device is made from a cheap plastic, that seemed neither sturdy or durable
The included case was also a downer, as it had no rigid structure to protect the $100 investment
These are by no means "life proof"
at least not for a person expecting "ear buds"
Overall-These are not great IEMs for real life
Go buy yourself a pair of X10s
I purchased these to use as my monitors for the cover band I play in
The sound is great when you get the right tips on the ear buds, plenty of bass and I'm a bass player so that was important
The price was certainly right on this product for what you get
If I had to say one thing negative about them is they don't fit perfectly, but I didn't purchase custom fit buds so there ya go
All in all a great product I would recommend to any musician looking for affordable in-ear monitors
I am a drummer at my church, so I primarily use these as in-ear monitors for a live music performance application
The buds are designed for maximum isolation from outside noise (great for drummers
), which helps preserve the bass frequencies
These are fantastic, especially for the price
I've owned and demo'd earbuds costing 2-3 times as much that didn't sound as good as these
I was especially pleased with the bass response; I can't understand how a single-driver earbud has this nice of a range
I ordered the clear ones, which don't stand out as much visually (a good thing
) Music from my iPod sounds great too; they handle a variety of musical styles very well
Easily the best earbuds I've used at this price; I would reccommend these to anyone, especially musicians
These earphones are alone in their class for the price
They compete with earphones that cost $300-$400
BUY THEM
Could not be more satisfied
Two years ago, my Shure E2C IEMs finally gave up on me
I really liked those
At the time, they were the best I could find for the price
Since then, I have tried several sets, such as Monster Turbine, Polk 6000, Bose IE2, and a couple others
Of the group, i surprisingly liked the Monsters the best for their audio, although the ear pieces were heavy
That pair finally broke a few months back, and I have been searching for a new set, trying to stay @ or below $100
After trying out a couple models, and reading a lot of reviews, I decided to come back to Shure
As soon as I put these on, my first thought was, "Why did I ever leave Shure
"
Shure has a whole line if IEMs, and these are the entry level for them
But entry level for Shure is way better than many others
PROS:Full range audio -  with natural sound that appeals to all the music I enjoy (which is an eclectic mix of pretty much anything)The fit
oh the fit - I personally like the foam tips that you squeeze, insert, and let fill your ear canal
They seal perfect, and stay in
The over the ear design of the cables -  These wrap around behind your ears to provide a more secure and comfortable fit
The old E2Cs were this way, and I had missed it
This generation is actually nicer in that you can conform the over ear portion to hold in place better
CONS:I wouldn't mind a lower price :)Um, well, I'll let you know when I find another one
Recently my Monster Turbines kicked the bucket so I was in the market for a new set of Ear buds for around $100
After researching for days I found that these made allot of lists for best headphones for about $100  so I decided give them a try
Initially I struggled getting them in my ear, the cable goes over the front of your ear and down behind it, and way they fit into your ear was a foreign to me at first
Maybe I was tired; maybe I had one too many beers, but had to Google some images to figure it out
Finally, I got them in my ears and cables situated, and I will say that they are perfectly comfortable
I wear them at work and they do a great job of noise isolation, so much so that I have to take them out when someone needs to speak with me
Compared to my old Turbines which had just your standard ear bud fit, these don’t easily pop out and back in, it takes 15-20 seconds to get them on and situated
I know that’s a small complaint, but when you have to do it often, it can be cumbersome
Finally my last complaint is the jack that plugs into your MP3 player is fat and doesn’t play well with cases
I have to take my I phone case off in order to plug it in
Now, on with the good; I was not sure if I liked them initially as they had much more bottom heavy sound, the Turbines were much brighter
After some time I realized the sound stage is just different and they grew on me
Listening to music, I heard elements I never knew existed in some of my favorite songs
They sound great
I would definitely recommend them if you’re in the market for a set of IEM’s and have a $100 budget
Pros:• Removable cable can be replaced with one that controls your I phone• Great sounding for the price• Noise Isolation• Multiple Tips to customize fitCons:• May be too Bass heavy for some• Very different fit then a standard ear bud• Plug to fat to work with most cases
As other reviewers have said, the sound quality of these in ear monitors is very impressive
I will not get technical and break down the frequency response curve and such since others have already done so
I will simply say that to me they sound great
the only problem for me is that the outer part of my ears where the body of the iem sits is on the small side, so they do become uncomfortable for me to ware for long periods
But oh the do sound so good
I've been a Shure customer for nearly 6 years or so  starting with a pair of E3cs
They were astounding and showed me what I was missing using cheaper headphones
After some time, when the warranty ended, I thought it was time to upgrade to the SE 310s
These were also amazing with even more crispness and clarity in sound
The 310s, however, we're not very durable
the rubber casing around the buds eventually came off
Shure sent a replacement and I had the same problem within a year
So, then I saw what Shure did with their new models
The concept of trading out wires instead of replacing the whole pair was amazing to me and became the obvious economical choice
I honestly was afraid that these would be a downgrade in the sound department compared to what I previously owned, but was I wrong
In a back to back comparison between these and my 310s, I feel that these have an overall better soundscape
The 310s were incredibly crisp on both the mids and highs, but a bit lacking in the bass, not too bad as I primarily is ten to classical music
These, even though a bit less crisp, had a touch more oomph in the bass which results in a much better balanced  and rich sound across all genres
These buds particularly excel with electronic music with Royksopp, Animaal Kingdom, and Foster the People as examples
Overall, these headphones are exactly what I wanted: something a bit more durable than my last two pairs, is a little better suited to make every genre sound great, and has wires that stay put behind my ears
My only beef has to do with the plug unit
My 310s were clearly designed with mobile devices in mind, fitting every case with ease
Why they went back to a traditional, pre-mobile device plug is beyond me and a major headache when it comes to looking for a case for my devices
I had to file away some of my ipad mini case so the plug would fit
This is why I rated it 4-stars
If Shure can fix this with new wires, I'll be a happy man
Finally, Shure is my go to because of the great experience I've had with warranty claims
Anytime I've had a pair start to deteriorate, Shure has replaced my headphones at no charge and without question
I simply ship my worn out pair with proof of purchase and warranty forms to them and within a couple weeks have a new pair in the mail
The couple times I've called to make a claim, they've been friendly and helpful
I use to use really cheap earphones
and someone convinced me to try Shures after my most recent earphones died on me
The sound is great
and i have a feeling i won't have to replace them for a while
Brand new
Un-boxed
Plugged in
Noticed the left side cutting out after only 10 minutes
Pitiful, PITIFUL quality assurance by Shure
These should have NEVER passed inspection (if they even inspect in the first place)
Other than that, they sound "okay"
It's nice to hear good staging and clear mids from earphones in this price range
The bass is present, fully represented without exaggeration
I can hear reverb and vocal nuances I have been missing with cheaper headsets
I wanted a clear and neutral sound, and that's what I got
A few notes for smartphone users, the jack is right-angled, and very thick
As a result, it would not plug into my phone with the TPU case on
I fixed this by using a x-acto knife to open the hole in the case a bit
If you buy the android/ios headset accessory with mic/buttons, be aware that the cable provided is not as good as the original, and won't wrap behind the ears easily
I'm sure mines came defective as I can hear static when listening, but I also noticed the earphones have great background sound but the singer's voice sounds far and hollow
Not worth $100 My Image S4 earphones sound better and they're only $40
It's disappointing because these are advertised as providing 37 dB of isolation, assuming a good fit using their foam earplug-like attachment
Here's my thoughts:1
The shape is odd and clumsy, like sticking a yo yo in your ear
2
The cord is long enough to skip rope with
3
You need small hands and a death grip to remove the tips
4
My over-the-ear, non-isolating Sennheiser's have better sound isolation
5
Removing these and re-inserting takes time, so using these in the average workplace is out of the question
As a basic test, take a cheap pair of store-bought earplugs, which typically provide 29-32 dB of isolation, and find a spot with some amount of background noise (low-volume television, etc
)
With isolation this good, you should see someone's lips moving when they speak at normal volume, but you shouldn't hear even a whisper
These headphones don't even remotely come close to 37 dB of isolation
I'm assuming they used some sort of test device with inflatable ears to make this claim
10x better than those crappy Bose MIE2 and for less
Feels durable and extremely comfortable in your ear
Sound is fantastic, clear, and full of bass
Shure still provides a good quality product
priced right tooOlder models have more bud adaptors and kit is included also
Pros:  very good sound isolation
Actually considering using when I go trap shooting
Equally as good as the earplugs I usually use
Was looking forward to using them on my next long flight if they hadn't stopped working
Cons:- A bit awkward to put on
Takes a bit getting used to
- Right bud stopped working after very light use (only at my desk at work) for 3 months
I know it's the bud not the wire because I swapped the buds and the left one worked on the right wire
They should still be under warranty but I got them as part of a prize package at work so I don't have the purchase receipt required to get warranty service
I'm just glad I didn't have to pay all the $$ for these
I would be TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED
If you buy these KEEP YOUR RECEIPT
You WILL need it WHEN (not if) you have to send it in for repair
The sound on these monitors is great (after breaking them in of course)
The real reason for the review is Shure's great service
One of my earbuds inexplicably went out
I cleaned them with the tool provided to no avail, so I decided to send them back to Shure
They received the earbuds on a Friday night (confirmed via email) and by Tuesday I had a replacement pair from them
Great service
Very fast
They clearly are standing by their product
Great company
Highly recommended
Read some online reviews about these headphones and I decided to take a chance
So I added them to my Christmas Wish List and my wife got them for me
All I can say is WOW
There is a learning curve on how to get them to properly fit in your ear, but once you get "it" and are able to feel the proper fit, it's very easy
They are very comfortable and the sound is INCREDIBLE
I had a pair of Denon, which I loved, but the wire sheath where they attached to the earphone kept pulling apart
And while they still work today, I was always concerned that one false move and a wire would get broken
My next pair was a pair of SkullCandy Titan
At first I liked them, but very quickly they became uncomfortable to wear for long periods
But with the Shure SE215-K are simply the best I have owned
The sound is clear and defined, and are very efficient
They are not too bassy, but not to tinny either
They are very balanced and sharp and defined
I would highly recommend these if you are in the market for a new pair of headphones
I have had five SHURE in-ear headphones over 5 years
The SE215 will be my last
Each one has had a similar problem - with the connector dieing and losing sound to one of the ear buds, usually the left
The sound, feel and fit are great
But I can not recommend them on durability
All my SHURE have lasted approximately a year
So bear in mind when you buy them - if 1 year is OK for the price, I can recommend them
If not, then look elsewhere
Thus the 3 stars instead of 1
I have small ears so finding a really good pair of earbuds that fits my ears is not easy so I was very happy with these
They fit into the cavity of my small ears and the wires are bendable and stiff so they keep their shape
This means that I can basically fit the main part into the cavity of my small ears and mold the stiff wires over my ears to keep everything in place
Fantastic
The sound is also really excellent
I love that the wires are changeable as I've had Sony and two Sennheiser's before and each lasted about 2 years with the wires being the weakest link
With these, if the wires go, you can just buy new wires and screw them in
It lost 1 star because mainly for the instructions of putting them into your ears
It's a bit tricky to put in at first and it seems to be getting easier with time but it's been a few months and I still find myself fumbling
If the instructions were better I'd know if it's my method that's totally wrong or if it really just takes time
The sound is excellent, I couldn't ask for anything better in a pair of ear buds
The draw back is that it is a nuisance to put in your ear
Sound quality is very good
They seem a little more bass heavy than the SE210's they are replacing, but have a relatively balanced response
These definitely sound better than any $10-20 headphones I've ever heard
The wireform near the earphones helps provide a secure fit even during exercise
It takes a little getting used to the over-the-ear fit if it's something you aren't used to, but are fine once you get used to it
The variety of eartips help ensure you get a good fit and do a good job of blocking out sound
The cable seems to be relatively heavy-duty while still flexible
There is some cable noise, but is far from a problem
The replaceable cable is an interesting (and I believe good) idea, but is kind of difficult to get the cable properly snapped into the earphones
Thankfully this is something that you will probably rarely do
Overall I would recommend these earphones if you are looking for something in this price range
The sound quality is a bit disappointing
It lacks clarity
In addition, there is also cable noise when it it touched which is annoying
For about the same price, you can get a much better sound from headphones such as Audio Technica's M50
On the other hand, the noise isolation and build quality seem good
Stopped working after 6 months of light use
Now the left ear will stop playing music intermittently but come back on if I jiggle the headphones around a little
Annoying for such an expensive product
Every musician should have one of these, now i can hear everything in a very peaceful way when im playing live, they have great bass response and high end too, they look very durable, and the detachable cable its an awesome feature
they are designed for syncing on the stage while you are singing, they have horrible sound quality and are extremely uncomfortablethey do not have bass as they are not designed for it, they have faint beat if you max out your low frequencies in the EQdo not buy this type of earphones, iPhone earphones are amazing, so are BOSE, those are designed for music and movies, nothing else
Significantly worse sound quality than my old SE210s, which are still working great after 5 years
I bought a pair of these for a friend and decided to get myself a set to make sure they were good
Sound is very muddy, the highs are not very clear, and the bass is exaggerated
I would compare these to iphone earbuds before comparing them to my old SE210s
I guess the build quality is better than my old headphones, but I bought these for sound
The new cable is neat but these take ages to put in ear compared to my old SE210s with the ordinary plastic cable
It's a pain to get these seated then wiggle them around and possibly unseat them while trying to put the formed cable over your ear
It also has a terrible connector that will not pass through an iphone case
Very nice headphone, good noise canceling
only complaint is how long it takes to put them on
ones you are locked in you are in a different reality though
overall a good headphone for the price and i would recommend them
They sound good and definitely isolate
Putting them in takes some getting used to
I don't use them daily, so it's not second nature yet
Singing on stage, I've been mostly using only one, which worked great in that particular setting
This is the first product I've felt the need to write a review about so here goes:I have a lot of headphones
Panasonic  in earBeats by dre in earThe new Polk nue voe in ears(consumers choice)Monster Jamz in earAKG over ear semi openKlipshe over ear closedAnd these
The Shure SE215s are my favorite by far
They aren't the easiest to put on
They aren't the most convenient either
What they offer is pure performance
Sex for the ears
The first time I got these to fit and turned them up, I got almost teary-eyed
Chills
I clearly had been missing something
$100
They out perform all 6 of my other headphones
All of which are valued above $100
Extremely impressive noise canceling
You've probably read other reviews say the same
DONT buy these for riding your bike/motorcycle etc on public roads
You will not hear anything but music
I'm not sure if you'd even hear a car horn to be honest
So take it on the plane, to the gym, at home, at work or wherever else you don't need to hear anything else
The clarity is outstanding
Precise highs and rich, accurate lows
Mids aren't the best of my bunch, but I'd say they're pretty good overall
The cord i believe is made of Kevlar
It doesn't behave like other cords you've had
That coupled with the 'around the ear' design keep it from getting in the way at the gym or flailing around while running
It will also never tangle
Never
It's not so great because you can't crumple them up into a ball like I know some of you do when you put them away
I've lost a few headphones to the cord breaking, so I know why they reinforced these so much
I welcome their heavy dutiness, but that's not to say you'll find them as convenient
I don't know why there's no volume control
It doesn't bother me too much, because I have to take them off to talk to someone anyways
(again, you won't hear much with them on)
The overall max volume of these are on the good side compared to other $200 sets
I've heard a tiny bit of over modulation but only at max volume which I never need to use
I've also noticed the sound can cut out if the jack isn't seated properly
This is rare, but annoying
Overall, well, I've told friends that this is my favorite worldly possession
I guess that should tell you something too
$100 is a steal for this kind of audio
I was looking for earphones to listen to sleep sounds at night
All others I tried were too bulky or poorly constructed
I had the westone um-1 earphones and they were okay but the right ear stopped working
These shure's are durable, non-instrusive and sound great
I love that the cord breaksaway so I have no fear of choking myself at night
Definetly recommend these if your need some to use for sleeping
My old E5c's finally died on me after many years of service (wires got caught on one too many weight machines)
I loved the way they sounded and fitted, so I went with these
They have blown me away
They sound just as good, with even more bass
I don't know how Shure does it
I paid around $350 for my E5c's back in the day
These are a 100% steal
I'm sure someone has mentioned it already, but I highly recommend you CAREFULLY remove the plastic sheath and metal rod where the wire meets the earbud
So much easier to maneuver the wire around your ear
Thank you Shure
I will admit to being a Shure fan
I have owned a pair of their SCL4 earphones that I have always loved
Well, those became misplaced, so I set out to purchase new ones
I debated about getting the SE215 VS the SE315 vs the much more expensive SE425's and decided to go with the less expensive SE215's based on their reveiws here and at other locations
The earphones come with a set of the medium squishy foam inserts pre-installed
This was my only issue with this unit - the foam inserts had become welded onto the earpiece and I was using enough force to remove them that I was concerned for breaking my brand new earphones before even getting to use them
A quick trip to the Shure FAQ online and I found that if you can wedge your fingernail under the white plastic portion, you can pry them off
Shure also has some instructions for freezing the units (
) to facilitate removal of the ear insert
Once I finally got the correct sized inserts for me installed, I was finally able to listen to them
I mainly listen to pop/rock music and on occasion some classical
For pop/rock, these things are wonderful - tons of detail
I hadn't noticed that in the song "Best Day of my Life" that you can hear them counting in during one of the rests
Or all the atmospheric effects at the beginning of "Kings and Queens"
I love being able to hear all those details
The bass levels are very nice - crisp and not too "boomy"
With a good ear seal, I am plenty happy with the sound of these earphones
For classical music, they are good, but probably not quite as nice as for pop/rock music
Now, it might be the quality of my recordings, (orchestra recordings aren't always the greatest), but it doesn't seem to pick out the details that I want to hear when I am listening to classical with them
If you mainly listen to classical, then you might look at the more expensive units Shure sells
It is possible however that I am overly picky, as I do play in an orchestra so I am used to listening to orchestras from the "inside" so to speak
The connection to the removable cord seems very high quality
It is fairly simple to snap them in and out and the connection feels very solid
The cord is very long and very flexible, which is nice
The earpieces have a small section of bendable plastic right at the driver area, so that you can curve them around the top of your ears
Once you get the plastic formed for your ears, they just pop right in, very easily
I remember always having to fiddle with my old SCL4's and these go in much faster and seem much more comfortable
For the price, these things are a steal
I wish I could do a direct comparison between these and my now lost SCL4's, but I am pleased as punch with the quality of these and I don't miss my old SCL4's at all
Bought these headphones for $100 LESS THAN 2 months ago, the left earbud is entirely gone
dead
no sound
Amazon will not replace them NOR refund, not even a partial refund cause I'm over 30 days
I've been buying Shure headphones for probably the past ten years, these may be my last pair
has happened with a few one them - lost sound entirely
but never this FAST
Very annoyed by Amazon's lack of sympathy in this situation where they sold a crap product and will do nothing about it
These paired with a high quality mp3 player, gives you ear candy
Despite being small in-ears they pack a lot of good sound and some bass
Great buy
:)
Great headphones, I love to use them to rehearse using triggers on my drumset
Finally I can hear my drumming with almost no noise from the other instruments
not for the average consumer
im sure it sounds great to audiophiles but it was average to me, not to mention that the fit is unusual
Great product
Work like a champ as Shure stated
Heavy duty and no issues whatsoever
Shure the only serious choice
Bought these to replace a pair of SE310's I left on a plane
Sound quality is excellent, exactly what I expect from shure-clear notes and balanced sound
The multiple included eartips makes it easy to find the ones that work best for your ears
The external body of the headphones is larger than it appears, slightly uncomfortable for me, but maybe I'll get used to it in time
It is flat, so it doesn't hurt your ear if your head is laying against a pillow or airplane seat
If the external body of the headphones was slightly smaller, I'd give this product 5 stars
Best earphones under 200$Pros: Superb Clarity, Perfect Bass, Good Isolation, High Quality Construction and Replaceable CablesCons: Not Highly Comfortable (3
5/5)
Best sounding, best noise cancellation, most comfortable earbuds on the market period
They sound so rich and full when properly placed in the ear
I've been through every brand except Bose and nothing compares
I use earbuds pretty much only when I cut my lawn
I've been using a pair of jvc in ear buds I bought from wal-mart $20 for years
My wife gave me these shure se-215 noise cancelling earbuds for christmas and I was excited until I used them
The sound was inferior to my cheap jvc earbuds
The highs were way less clear and defined and the bass was non-existant even with the largest foam earbuds they provided with the unit
On top of if all, the plug didn't fit it my phone with any of the 4 cases I have and they are minimalist cases
So every time I used these earbuds with my phone I would have to take the case off
I kept trying to like these because my wife paid so much for them but I just kept going back to my old faithful jvc cheapies
The final straw was when I left my jvc earbuds at work and I had to use these
I dropped my phone from maybe 2 feet while using these, no case because of the stupid plug design, and cracked my screen
I've dropp3d my phone several times before with no issue with the case
I threw them in the garbage because I was tired of trying to like trash because my wife paid waaaayyy to much for this junk
Very quickly, the sound is great but the ear buds are very difficult to insert
Despite a couple weeks of effort, they still take quite a bit of time to get the wires just right that they can be inserted
I have owned 4 pairs of SHURE headphones
All of them were the 215 variety
Every pair has had one of the speakers stop working
This occurs gradually, first the splitter become shorted and you have to press it to get it to work, next the whole side is dead
I do not recommend this product
I usually got about 9 months from them, 100
00 for 9 months of life is not acceptable
If you have looked on their website to send these in costs about as much as a new set
I'm used to owning cheap $40 earphones so this one required a bit of diving into the pockets, but it's worth it
For the price, the sound quality is unparalleled
I literally cannot hear a thing when I am listening to music
I also use it on stage as I play in a band and the bass packs a good punch
Considering it even has a two year warranty, I consider it one of the best investments that can be made
Needed some good headphones for drumming and practice
They have great isolation depending on the ear foam you use
And my ears are no longer ringing when i'm done with my gigs
Quality is great
For the price, very clear sound with decent bass but a little uncomfortable for extended listening
a little bit of a hassle to initially fit
I bought these headphones so that I could wear them while riding my motorcycle
They do a great job of fitting in your ear so the helmet still fits comfortably and the sound truly is far superior and more isolated than with any other headphone I tried so far
The only reason I did not give this item a 5 star is because they aren't very practicle in any situation where you might want to take them out and put them back in more often
An example of this would be at the gym
They are just too much of a hassle to put in your ear properly for that and the cord is too rigid
Upgraded from the Klipsch S4 earphones which got a short in the cord
I was attracted to these because of their reputation but also because of the replaceable cords--which is very nice for this price range
The earphones are a little heavier than the S4 but fit very nicely and block out sound MUCH better (I'd say at least 1/3 more sound is blocked out)
Due to the wrapping over the ear, the Shure don't get too heavy
I was immediately impressed with the better sound quality and bass (and this is even before breaking in the speaker)
Used Phil Collins "In the air tonight" as the initial test and really sounded great
Key to these is getting the right fitting ear cushions
After that, just enjoy the music
After 2 months of moderate use the right ear piece went dead
when working the sound was solid
the noise cancelation was also pretty good
however, a refund through amazon hits you up for a $20 restocking fee
bogus
not worth the gamble
not easy to use it , needs to get the hang of it
but its really good at isolating outside noise
eg: metro ride , bus ride
) but that can be dangerous when you drive as u dont hear no s*** at all
Well, I didn't want to go back to sennheiser cx300ii even if I liked them very much I wanted a change so I did a research and found the Shure se215 :Pros - contraction is great & the looks of them is beautiful (clear,can see the inside)Sound of mid range preforms very very goodCables can be replace or upgradeMusic and you only
Complete insulationGreat sound for: Dance, trance and electronic music
A Great bass preform for such a style of musicHighs are great as wellCons -Bass sometimes feel muddy (mostly in heavy metal music)Soundstage too wide sometimesTo put them in your ears can be quite a hard taskPrice is too high ( my personal If some will ask me, i would buy them again or might go even for the highest model the se535
I'm a drummer who needs in-ear monitoring for live and studio situations
I'd been using Vic Firth Isolation Headphones which I think are good, BUT I've always wanted something smaller and lightweight for using live and not look like Princess Leia
I was in doubt at first beacuse I thought "how much sound isolation will I get with just in-ear earphones
"
and the result was amazing
I'm pretty sure this Shure in-ear headphones isolate more external sound than my Vic Firth Headphones (which might be bad for some)
but for me it was perfect
I wouldn't comment on sound quality, which I think is good, but I've never tried those more expensive earphone models with more sound drivers and stuff
Oh, and I think the price is decent for what you get
Not as much bass as I'm used to, but then again, it is due to the well balanced frequency response
Highs are very easily discernible and overall less muddled then comparably priced units
I do wish it had more bass though
I've had this product for about 6 months and the performance has been consistent throughoutI also own a pair of bose mie2i earphones, and in my opinion the shure 215's have more acoustic meritProsgood sound isolationvery good sound quality: very solid bass that balances well with treble;with noise isolation it creates a well-rounded listening experienceappears as in picture- people will notice the unconventional designearbud covers come in several sizes and in foam earplug-like material (for better sound isolation) as well as conventional rubberConsalthough the cord is extremely thick and resilient, the detaching mechanism, despite the good intentionsof giving you the capability of replacing faulty wires without having to replace the drivers, seems fairly temperamental
After about 5 months of regular but cautious use, I noticed in the middle of listening to something the right driver had ceased to functionHowever, after fiddling with it slightly, the sound came back on
After further inspection and several other occurrences, I think the problemhas to do with the connection between driver and cord because it starts working again when I rotate the driver around the socket a certain wayOnce this issue presented itself, I started using them only at home so as to avoid further stressing the connection
The reason I'm writing this review half a year after purchase is because I just picked them up after several weeks of not using them,and the acoustic difference between shure and bose has struck me so much I decided to write this
I have used the Bose in ear headphones and liked these better
The fit is a little different and takes getting used to, but overall a great set of headphones
love these headphones for their quality and durability
i definitely recommend these as the minimum to any appreciator of fine sounding music
The primary reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their noise-isolation
I must agree- these are by far the most noise-isolating earbuds I have ever worn
Noise levels of these are significantly less than my noise-canceling ear buds
The second reason I purchased these was because of good reviews of their comfort
They have a small profile that fits within the external ear, meaning that I can lie down with my head against a pillow and experience no discomfort
I am not aware of any other earbuds on the market that share this characteristic
I was delightfully surprised by the excellent build-quality of these earbuds
Although these are in mid-tier price range (currently $99), they have the build quality of higher-tier earbuds that normally go for $200-$300
I highly recommend these
They are great for studying and falling asleep in a noisy environment
I haven't really used them yet for the intent of stage monitors, but when listening with my laptop music, they are really nice
Takes a little adjustment to get them just right in your ear, but overall, seems like high quality at an affordable price
The sound quality is of a $30 dollars headphones - there's not other way to put it
They are weird shaped and it takes time to getting used to
I am not a big fan of the loops over ears
It's just too much skin contact to feel like you wearing ear-buds
The wires are felt on your neck and this is the way it was designed too
The wires are too thick and not flexible enough
The product is made in China- I can tell it affects quality
Sound isolation is good - that's the only positive, but it blocks all sound
Sometimes on a airplane I want to heart when a food cart is behind me but not the constant engine noise
I am thinking about returning them as they are just not worth the price
These truly live up to the Shure name - excellent sound, excellent isolation, balanced sound , truly thumpy bass, excellent cable build, little/no microphonics, superb and sturdy connectors
Since i said thumpy bass, let me clarify, this is an overall performer at all bands - low to high, though much better at handling low frequency than highs, having said that it will produce clear highs and mids and one shouldn't notice
I listen to a wide range of music : from blues to progressive metal, classic rock, electronic minimal, psybient and some hip hop
In none of the genres i felt these earphones did a less than admirable job ( obviously the source should be either lossless or 320kbps bitrate files)
One of the winners is the excellent isolation it will give you, its almost soundproof and you wont hear any external sounds when they are on ( comes with a ear buds of various sizes and shapes, foam and silicon)The only hitch may be encountered while getting used to them, they go over the ears and that may take some time to get used to but hey, you better do if you want aural pleasure
Highly recommended to any audiophile who takes their music seriously
These are great earphones for such a great price
I'm a huge fan of Shure
As a bassist myself I appreciate the deep and clear sound of the bass that these earphones give me
It has a nice response to treble too
It also looks really cool
Just got these headphones in
Sound quality is amazing
The cord is very solid, it's not like your average headphones with the cheap wiring
The wire is actually covered by a tough and sturdy material so it seems pretty hard to actually separate the wire from the buds
The only downside to this product is putting it in your ear
I had a hard time putting these into my ear because I was not familiar with structure of the earbuds
It takes some time to get use to it
My only tip is to shape the wire around your ear before placing the buds into your ear canal
Once I got the earbuds in, the fit was fine
I can barley hear anything after they have been placed in properly
Overall the quality of the product and the sound quality of the earbuds are excellent
I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for high end earbuds
I like it and It sound good but not so comfortable for the wearing
Hope it better after burn in
Great single driver inner ear monitors
I use them for riding and working out
This is my third pair of shures and I will keep on collecting them as needed
My other two pair are the se210 and se310
My se210 were chewed up by my new pup, so the se215 are replacing them
The se310 are for long trips, studying, and work projects
Sound quality is excellent for the price and the replaceable cables will be an awesome plus if I leave my iem's out on the coffee table again
( I listen to different styles, but most of the time - black metal, death, doom, goth and industrial
)SE215-K are Amazing little earphones
After burn-in the sound quality is getting close to my $400 Denon D2000s
A little less bass  (but still enough), but SE215-K have more natural (realistic) sound
SE215-K don't need to be amp'ed, I didn't hear any difference
They need to be deep in ears to get sufficient sound isolation (up to -26 db) and great bass
Carrying case is nice and useful
They look very good (in ears and in hands :) )  Big plus that they give me less sound pressure on my ears than D2000s do
I would recommend these earphones to everyone, unless you have a budget to get 535s, UE reference monitors or sennheiser IE800 :)comfort: 4
5 starssound quality: 5 starsnoise isolation: 4
8 starsvalue: 5 stars
This was my third pair of Shure's, and the first that I've had any trouble wearing
They're much bigger than the SE115s I am trying to replace, the stiff cord around the ears near is annoying, but the real problem was the size and shape of the ear buds vs the size and shape of my ears
Without proper positioning, you don't get good sound, but putting them in that position was painful
They did sound good, but I am not going to endure any kind of pain just to listen to my iPod
Bring Back The SE115s
I've been playing professionally for about 10 years, and touring for 5 of those years
This is my 3rd set of professional in-ear monitors
I have previously owned a set of Customer molded LiveWires and Westone UM-2's with detachable molds
To be completely honest, the sound quality, clarity, fit, and finish of the Shure SE215's are AS GOOD, if not BETTER THAN both sets of custom buds I had in the past
I highly recommend these to any professional musician, or music enthusiast looking for a very reliable set of in-ears
This is my 4th or 5th pair of Shure earbuds
I've been a nightclub dj for almost 2 decades, so I've been through a LOT of headphones
I don't use earbuds for gigs, but do wear them daily in the office & doing yardwork, exercise, etc
I originally purchased the Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones in 2010 & the dealer kept having to replace them, due to the cabling cracking where it fits around the ear, causing the sound to go out
They kept phasing out models & sending me the "latest & greatest" models, which is how I ended up with these
In all cases, Shure's customer service has been stellar, swapping the previous versions out quickly with no questions asked
I did have to pay for this set, b/c it had been about 8 months out of warranty finally, but they gave me a reduced price on them
The SE215-CL's sound great so far
As good as any high quality dj phones I've used
Seems the bass is a little chunkier on these & it appears they attempted to remedy the faulty cable issue on my last 4 pair by putting a little rubber casing around the cord & making it detachable, but I still see a lot of reviews citing similar issues as before
at least their customer service has been stellar to date, so if they go out again
I would imagine they'll swap them out no questions asked
Fingers crossed these last a while
These sound great but they don't fit that well, which reduces their noise suppressing feature
And they are incredibly hard to put on
If I'm wrong about that, I'd love to know
please comment and tell me what you do to decipher which way they go every time you put them on
There is so much swivel and reorientation going on, it's hard to figure out how to wear them
It takes a couple minutes to put them on each time
Once on, they stay on pretty well, because of the over-the-ear wire option
The other thing I'm dissatisfied about here is that Amazon misstates the MSRP as being higher than it is, and they thereby claim that these things have a bigger discount than they really do
The true discount is very small
High End-ish, that is
Had them for about four months
Sound quality is so much better than Skull Candys, Apple earphones/"earpods" (or whatever they're called), those cheap earphones you get at 5below or Walmart
I can't go back to those after using these because they sound just terrible
I appreciate that it comes with a carrying case and has all the different sizes buds
They stay in my ears much better than Skull Candy earphones, though I've always thought those were a joke anyway
BUT, they do still fall out sometimes
Seal is good, and I'm using the correct size buds (I think) but they just do
Only reason they lost a star for me is because of that
For someone who typically has issues with the fit of in ear headphones, Shure has been the best for my money yet
I had the older model which fit great and was concerned buying these since they changed the style slightly but was pleasantly surprised
Also, for those not wanting to pay the extra $ for noise cancellation, even playing these at low volumes drowns out almost all background noise
One ear never worked properly, and the seller would not RMA them
They told me i had to go through Shure which takes forever
My guitarist is on his 3rd pair, finally got one that doesn't sound horrible
Sad but true
After 3 painful returns with Shure, i finally have a pair that work so upping from 1 star to 3 stars
They sound great when they work
Just wish i wasnt worried everytime i put them on that they werent going to
I am an audiophile and I should say that this earpiece met my expectations as far as sound
I will keep this short and give the pro's and con'sPro's:- Very good balanced sound
I compared it to my Klipsch S4i II which has a very good review by cnet as well as other sites
I must say that the sound quality of SE 215 surpassed it when it came to clarity and the well roundedness of the sound
One of the best when it comes to sound quality in this price range
- One of the sturdiest earphones that you will find
It's built like a tank compared to most others in this price range
- The detachable wires are great
You can replace them without shelling out the bucks for a new one
- Excellent noise cancellation
Cons:- The only issue I had with this, which is not really a bad problem, was the seal on my ear was too tight
While I enjoyed the noise cancellation I couldn't use it for long durations
Considering the fact that it was built mainly for stage performance, it makes sense that the seal is superb and its not streamlined for hours and hours of music
- The chord length can sometime bother people because its built really well and its regid
So
All in all a 5 star product when it comes to build and sound quality and for the right kind of usage
I have owned 4 pairs of SHURE headphones
All of them were the 215 variety
Every pair has had one of the speakers stop working
This occurs gradually, first the splitter become shorted and you have to press it to get it to work, next the whole side is dead
I do not recommend this product
I usually got about 9 months from them, 100
00 for 9 months of life is not acceptable
If you have looked on their website to send these in costs about as much as a new set
Great sound and perfect fit to the ear's shape
The bass are amazing and the noise isolating too
Just great
Sound quality great as usual but the headphones themselves are awkward to put in ear
Not sure they are right for me
Slightly uncomfortable, takes some getting used to
Outstanding sound, little light on the bass but that's mostly due to low quality MP3s
Bought these as a gift for my husband
He LOVES the earphones but hates the plasticky inserts for the ears, If you don't like them either, try using the foam earpieces that come with other brands that are like foam earplugs
As soon as he replaced those, he LOVED the earphones
He used http://www
amazon
com/gp/product/B0078JXDRI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02
ie=UTF8&psc=1 and they work great
They arrived on time and are perfect
they stay in my ears and don't fall out
Took a bit of getting used to to put them in
SOUNDI bought these ear-buds along with one of the Dr
Dre Beats headsets to compare the sound
They were both exactly the same price but the Shure earbuds busted a righteous cap in Dr
Dre's pretentious creation
The rich, creamy sound coming out of these Shure puppies is amazing
It allows for the correct balance between the bass, the mids, and the highs without any distortion at various volume levels
I couldn't believe it
The Beats earbuds had an ounce of more bass to them but the mids and high's had that cheap tin-can sound
People's voices came off flat and isolated in relation to the other sounds and it didn't take long for the off-pitch ringing to hurt my ears
Even when I tested the prescribed bass-heavy Hip-Hop/Rap songs on both earbuds, the Shure's stomped-stomped-stomped the Beats out of the competition
Shure's bass, which is a fraction less than the Beats, was still excellent and provided for the sound that felt truly SURROUND
After I found that Shure's were the one for me, I submitted the Shure earbuds to other tests
NOISE-CANCELLATIONTechnically, these are "sound isolating" earphones and I don't know how that's different from "noise cancellation" but the one thing is true: these earbuds keep the outside noise out and music in
I drove over to my half-deaf grandmother's house just to test this
She likes to get up close and shout all holy-hell about if you'd like to eat
Cue Shure earbuds and stand in shock as grandmother is transformed into David Bowie singing "Ziggy Stardust" and holding a spatula
Crazy
I could only hear the music
But it needed more rigorous testing
I then went to a friends house who keeps a mini-zoo, including guinea pigs
If you've ever heard a guinea pig squeal, you'll remember it forever
"Wheee
Whee
Wheeeee
" I looked those noisy suckers right in the face, holding a carrot and daring them to defy the Shures
A tiny bit of the squeal came though - not even enough to notice unless you were, as I was, looking at them
But that might not be Shure's fault; guinea pigs are hyper-sonic furballs from another planet
FIT-DESIGNYes, the design is initially awkward
Yes, there was a moment when I felt like a lab-monkey, given triangle pegs to put in round holes
Yes, I initiated a contest in my family for who could figure it out the quickest
The current record is 2
75 minutes and one person still can't figure it out; it goes to show there's variation as far as personal adjustment to the design
I was right at 4 minutes the first time I put them in, but after 2 days of use, I can whip these puppies in and out of my ears single-handed and almost as fast as any conventional earbud set
It just takes some getting use to, but if you get frustrated, remember: THE SOUND IS WORTH IT
They do very well at staying put
After my 4 minutes of wrangling, I immediately started bouncing around and trying to dislodge them
In sum: running and jumping will not dislodge them; however, vigorous head-banging and a solid head-blow by a pillow, will
FEATURESNo features except extra-ordinary sound
There is no control function on the earbuds
This was a little off-putting for me
I like being able to answer calls, adjust the volume, skip tracks, etc
, directly from the earbuds
Such features are very convenient if you listen to your smartphone
If you listen to a single-function device like a MP3 player, then it might not be a big deal for you
Still, its not that bad
I mean, heaven-on-earth, I have to actually push the buttons on my iphone
YES, GOOD-LOOKS COUNT BUT
The Beats won the Beauty Contest
The Shure's didn't even get an honorable mention
The Shure's are not as clear as they appear in the picture
While the actual ear-piece is clear, the rest is like dull-silver
And the cable is thick; not thick enough to connect you directly to the energy grid, but thick enough to notice
I showed the thing to a person who knows way more about these things and he was knocked off his chair (in a good way)
He said, "Look at these
It's clear plastic over BRAIDED STEEL
Look
Look how much steal there is
" and he went on how the steal made some sort of difference in the quality of the sound, limiting frequencies or some such thing (I'm pretty sure I got it all wrong)
I looked at them and sure enough, I could see the braided steel
It certainly makes the earbuds durable
And while I'm not sure if walking around with these things makes you more susceptible to lightning-strikes, it certainly will not break when it does
Imagine: crispy critter with intact earbuds and a smile on face because he/she never heard the lightning storm in the first place
I'm just kidding
I'm sure these are perfectly safe
SUMMARY: In the end, I didn't hesitate to keep the Shure's, even in the face of lack-of-features and beauty-contest-rejection
For me, the sound outweighs everything and I will dwell is musical BLISS even as I push actual buttons on my Iphone and defend my Cool on the street
Sound is everything
I bought the older Shure SE115s a couple years ago
I loved them, even though the neck slide broke only a few weeks after getting them
Recently, the left bud stopped working, so I replaced them with these
Compared to the 115s, these are a pain to put on and actually hurt my ears--the ears themselves, not the eardrums--to wear, especially because of my glasses
The old design on the 115s was simpler and more streamlined; the 215s are more twisty and complicated, take longer to put and take off, are uncomfortable for long periods of monitoring, hover at times within your ear (creating poorer sound quality), and cannot be used without running the wire up and behind your ear, whereas the 115s could be used this way
You could just stick them in your ears and go, like traditional earbuds
And the sound was always impeccable
All that said, when the 215s are in well and snug, and not hurting my ear cartilage, they work well
Also, using them while drumming works well because they are very secure in your ear
Lastly, if the wire was to break, the buds are removable so the wire can be replaced
I should have done more research
I'm sending the 115s to Shure for repair
You should buy from that older line instead; these newfangled deals are too needlessly complicated
I keep doing this to myself buying products based upon reccomendations only to be dissapointed
These headphones sounded flat and not much better than ones i got for $25
Hi, I've just received my new 215Ks, in order to upgrade my Creative Zen player basic earphones
The sound now is really good in all frequency respone
I think it has been a good aquissition for the (a little high) price
I have an only one problem, yet not solved: If you want to keep stable in/on your ears and well sounding the 215 Ks you have to fit your ears to the earphones insead of the opposite¡I have carefully and slowly inserted the phones into my ears, have twisted the phones, even have twisted my ears (and a little bit of my brain
)once and again,
So finaly I got some possitions that go right
Well, so let's enjoy the music
Eventually, you can recieve a phone call or you realize someone is talkin to you
Then you pull off one ot the two earplugs in orther to answer or mantain a conversation
Bad
Later, you'll have to begin to look for, to find the apropiate way to fix again the earphone
But i'll nor surrender 'cause i believe that sooner or later I will get it with naturally
So cheer up, you'll also can do it
Nevertheless, really good sound, no doubt
Jaime
Madrid
I do NOT like them but to be honest it's my issue because I don't like so much of the outside noise blocked out
I've been a follower of Shure Headphones for several years and wouldn't trade them in for any other headphones
Whether I'm out on a hike or on my Harley, these headphones always deliver great, clear sound with a surprising amount of solid bass
Highly recommended
This is the second set that I have owned
The last set lasted at least three years but finally needed to be retired
The sound quality is unbelievable on these and the noise cancellation is more than adequate to filter out most of the background and let you enjoy quality sound at a much lower volume
Definitely recommend these
I bought these earphones for my daughter as she is an aspiring worship leader and plays in the student praise band at our church
Since I use a pair of my own, I already knew the fidelity was top notch, clean highs, good bass response, noise cancelling, all the things you need on stage running IEMs
I highly recommend this product
You could spend three times what you spend on these and not improve the over sound quality appreciably
Go with these and keep your money
I never thought that good earphones were worth the money, until I tried these ones
I actually first bought a pair of the old version of these earphones, they lasted me for 4-5 years
Now I get to re enjoy them in their format
The earphones disconnect themselves from the main cable, which is great because that is what normally fails first (as was the case for my old pair)
Now, right next to the earphones the cables are semi rigid, in order to offer support on the ear, I still find this a bit uncomfortable as it is something new and unexpected, but can't complain at all
You will never listen to your music the same way
Great sound when the correct tips are used
It's a must to have them sealed completely off in your ear otherwise they will sound weak
Great product for the price,  the tangle free cord is a great feature
clear sound, headphones stellar quality for this price
you hear all the lows, songs you listened to thousands of times some how sound even better with more clarity
you just have to find the correct tips for your ears simce no two ears are alike
The sound is great, but that's what you expect from a company like Shure, so i'm going to skip that part of the review
The tough thing to get used to is how to put them in
They come with the medium foam ear inserts which were a bit too big for my ears so I switched to the small ones
I LOVE the foam inserts
I squeeze them down to as small as I can get them, put them in my ears, and they expand to fill my ear canal over the next 10-15 seconds
During that time you can feel the rest of the world melt away
It's really incredible how much outside noise these block even when music isn't playing
With music on, the outside world is absolutely gone
I can't hear anyting except the music even on an airplane with someone speaking over the PA
I also use them at the gym and I don't hear anything of the outside world
They are a little funky to put in, especially the first few times
I've had them for about 3 weeks now and just put them in very quickly and easily
In short, give them a week to grow on you - you'll be happy
I had read up on these ear buds as a good alternative to the larger over the ear noise canceling headphones and was very surprised to see them show up at my door a day early, however my joy ended there
Right from the start the box showed signs that it had been glued shut (finger print where super glue had removed just a little box paint), clearly previously opened, but I figured I'd see if it was perhaps just cosmetic damage and that everything else inside would be fine; it was not
The cords had been twisted together, appearing to have kinks, and the different sized cups and cleaning tool was missing
Clearly this product had been returned by someone else and the seller simply sent if off to me without even inspecting the outer box for 'tampering'
For a product that goes INSIDE the body (all-be-it a very small amount) I DO NOT WANT a previously used product that didn't even get inspected
I'm sure the ear buds are great but I'm never going to find out because I'm not interested in any product from a seller who doesn't care enough inspect this 'type' of product before trying to send it off to another customer
For the price I was expecting a 'new' product, not one that had already been inside someone else's ears
The headphones have excellent sound quality and the reinforced cable near the earpieces solves a problem I had with my last pair of Shure earbuds - the cable frayed near the earpieces after just a couple of months
On the other hand, they don't do a very good job keeping out ambient noise
My active noise-cancelling headphones are much better at that
Not as much bass as I'm used to, but then again, it is due to the well balanced frequency response
Highs are very easily discernible and overall less muddled then comparably priced units
I do wish it had more bass though
For $99 you can do a lot worse
Truly
There are so many products out there that hype themselves as standing out from the crowd, being something unique (using wood housing instead of plastic, I won't mention any specific names but I can assure you they don't sound as good as these
I've tried them, believe me)
These are absolutely phenomenal earbuds at their price point
The drivers are lively and separated but not shrill and cold which is often the case with balanced well separated headphones
They are neutral and give a perfectly balanced presentation of the music you are listening to but also give a lively and impacting presentation
A total joy to use
Any EQ tweaking will only make them sound inferior and bring out the weakness of whatever program you are using to alter the EQ
These are really quite good
Speaking as a person who has owned Sennheiser 650 HD with a $500 headphone tube amp
These are really the best headphones in their price category
I am not a Shure fanboy
Actually
My first pair of shure, e2c broke with light use
I had sworn them off (hence my foray into wood housed and otherwise earbuds, which is why I am giving you a highly appraised review despite my previous bad experience) but back with the 215k and I am really very satisfied
They are sturdy headphones
The cords are very robust
The quality is high
And I can't give you any faults
They are really very good and I would recommend them to anyone looking for earbuds in this price category
As an added bonus you won't have to hear any boneheads when you are on the bus or otherwise
They are really very good at blocking outside noises
Like, totally block any outside noise under 100db
Love these earbuds
They are really the best in this price range and you can't go wrong if you chose them
Once I got these earbuds, it took about a day and a half before I got them to fit the way I wanted
After that, the sound was much like my audio technica ath-m50's with a little cleaner highs and a little stronger bass and greater isolation
Overall, a relatively flat sound with a slight v curve
Well worth the money and time to get the fit right
I ride the bus to school all the time and these block out nearly all the sound of the bus and other passengers
I admit I'm no headphone connoisseur, but nonetheless I have not been really pleased with the sound quality
I often like to tailor my musical experience by genre (i
e
change intensities of various frequencies) and have found that from very low bass (e
g
hip hop) to very high pitches (e
g
classical music), these headphones have performed pretty well
In terms of sound isolation, they work extremely well and allow me to tune out really easily when needed
Lastly, I LOVE that they wrap around my ears - this means that I can actually wear them and walk around without them falling our of my ears (a big problem for me given my big ears
)
Overall, highly recommended for the given price point
It is tough for me to get these buggers to stay in
The stiffer part of the cord near the earpieces is meant to be bent into a form, but mine likes to wriggle around a bit like a fish
The result is that I am constantly adjusting them with my hand or shoulder-nudging them when I am running
I also don't like the biggish knobby plug-in
It's too big for my phone case to accept, so now I have my phone without its case
First world problems
I know
Sound quality is fantastic, however
As an audiophile, that really is my major criterion
superb, only complain is that its too big for my ears, but hey
maybe because i have small earssound quality is good, no complains therebeing so big, couldn't wear it more than an hour
I play drums in a regularly gigging band and have been wanting to move away from an active on stage monitor to an in ear system
I purchased these earphones and together with an inexpensive headphone amp I have achieved that goal
I now am able to hear the other musicians, as well as myself without the having my ears blasted by my drums along with a loud on stage monitor
I have used this setup a few times now and I really do like it
The sound produced by the Shure SE215's is very adequate for my monitoring needs
I am sure that had I spent many hundreds of dollars more on custom fitted ear phones I would have a even better result but this is fine for me and it was definitely an affordable solution
The cable on these is very heavy duty and I can see it being very durable
The wire near the ear pieces, bends nicely around the back of your ear and with the various types and sizes of rubber and foam inserts I think most people will be able to achieve a comfortable fit
I have recommended this product to friends and will do so in the future
I had purchased the Shure SE530 some years ago
The cabling finally wore out and they were done
They were quite wonderful and short of putting to hi-fi speakers to my ears, nothing compared
I thought about a reshell, but decided to try these
The sound quality of these SE215's is nearly equal
It was a little tricky learning how to wear them (several times until I grasped the concept), but no issues now
I primarily use them for workouts, walks, etc
I also have a pair of Klipsch S4-II, which does not have quite the sound quality, but are a good second
I would have given this 5 stars but for my initial difficulty in choosing the correct ear cover and getting them to stay in my ears
Finally in front of a mirror figured it out - the whole thing fits into the ear (duh :-))
I had never tried anything like this before and once I figured out how to keep them in, I was amazed at the outstanding quality of sound they provided
Glad I didn't give up and return them
Although these only have 1 driver
They are terrificly balanced and ready to use on the get go
I also recommend the yellow foam sleeves in addition when you buy
The Shure SE215k is a shallow fit, over-the-ear earphone
The package contents include: the earphones themselves, a set of S,M,L silicone tips, 1 set of memory foam tips, a cleaning tool for the ear tips, and a soft shell carry case
The earphones are made of a rigid plastic and the cables are thick and of high quality
These are very comfortable, but you will have to adjust to how big these are if you haven't owned something like this before
A nice little feature about these earphones is that the cables are removable and replaceable
You can either get the original cables from Amazon or Shure, but the cables from  the Logitech UE series earphones just as well and a bit cheaper too
On to the sound
This earphones has a lot of bass that extends down fairly deep and can sound a bit muddy on some tracks
With genres such as hip hop, dubstep, EDM, etc, these do a great job and will fulfill the needs of your average bass head
The mids are warm and very clear and the highs are a bit rolled off, maybe a little rolled off
Due to the rolled off highs, these are not fatiguing and can be used for several hours before having to take a break
Keep in mind that these isolate very well, so if you're walking down the street or anything, make sure you are well aware of your surroundings
The Shure SE215K is not without flaws however, there a few things that are bothersome right out of the box
The first is the fit of these earphones
While it isn't a big issue, new users might have problems properly inserting these into your ears
The core of the problem is the memory cord that wraps around your ear
You will need to bend constantly to conform to the curves of your ear but after a while it will retain its shape
These earphones perform extremely well and for the price, it includes many accessories
Shure even offers a 2 year warranty with the SE215K which adds even more value to the package
If you're a fan of good bass, warm mids, and slightly recessed highs, these earphones are a no brainer
I have headphones on about 80% of my day, every day
I needed some earbuds that could hold up a quality standard set by the headphones I use with my PC, these have met fit my bill perfectly, & for under $100
I couldn't have asked for more
I bought these because I have had several headphones fall apart after limited use
These ear buds are great
Built to last and the sound is great for me
I wear them while walking and traveling
The only small complaint is that the ear buds do expand into my ear and if I wear them for several hours at a time my ears start to get sore
Yah, these in-earphones are pricey
I run 6 days a week and they are amazing for running
no need adjusting your earphones because the sweat keeps making them slip out
the sound quality is amazing
and they are completely sound-isolating
Great investment
I never liked isolating in-ear earphones before, because usually I bought cheap ones which made bad sound, and uncomforting feeling
Besides that I have pretty big ears so my earbuds would always fell out on bicycle/running/other activity
I just ruined my Apple's new earphones when I broke on my bicycle and they fell out of my ears into the tires
Ok, let's go to Shure SE215-K
This are the most expensive earbuds I ever bought (even though $ 90 some people don't consider as really expensive)
I love the sound, they never fell out of my ears on the bicycle/running
They isolate all the sound around me when I listen to the music (so people have to wave at me if they want to talk)
It gets really windy in Hawaii and I was never able to listen to audio books on my bicycle on windy days, now I can
When I first inserted earphone into my ears it took me some time
Now I can get them in in less than 10 seconds :)I just love there earphones, and am just sad I didn't buy them before
the earphones do not sound as good as i have expected, but i am comparing them with se535
it is suitable for entry level but if you got enough cash, go for a higher model from shure directly
I TRYED TO MAKE THEM WORK, BUT THE FITTED JUST NOT WORKING, THE SOUND IS GREAT, TRY SEVERAL WAYS TO MAKE THEM WORK
He seems to like them
They are a major step up from what is included with the iphone
Would recommend them again and again
I bought these to use as in ear monitors for live playing
(I am a drummer)
The sound is good, if you can get the proper fit- I have to use foam inserts and insert them completely in my ears to get adequate bass reproduction
One major annoyance that I quickly discovered was that if you move around a lot, the rotating connection makes an audible grinding sound when then earphones are fully inserted
This is not a sound emanating from the earphones; it is a physical sensation caused by the rotating connection mechanism that is audible ( when inserted) especially when no sound is being emitted from a sound source
Very annoying
I ordered these as replacements for some E-3's that I used back in 2005 - The E-3's fit way better, and didn't have the annoying grinding sound
Aside from that, they do sound good- be sure to keep around plenty of fresh foam inserts; If they do not fit snugly in your ears, there is very poor bass response
Conversely, if the fit IS snug, the bass response is fantastic
I purchased these because I needed headphone at the gym that did not fall out easily
I was super impressed by the sound
The sound quality was nearly identical to my $350 Bose QC3 headphones
The only gripe was the breaking in the wire so that it looped around my ear easily
There is definitely a learning curve when putting these headphones on, but after about a week, it becomes second nature
Sounded great until one ear started going on and off
The went right back
I just ordered the x10 to replace them
Used it immediately and fell in love with it
The sound was awesome and the snug fit was great
Great product
First let me start off by saying that the sound quality is excellent on the e215
I only had two complaints, 1
It does not include a microphone and the microphone cable that you can buy separately is not coated with the same flexible material that wraps around the base of the e215's cord to help keep them from falling out your ear
2
The sound would cut in and out if I moved the cord
I looked online and found this to be a common issue with Shure
Amazon exchanged them for another pair and they are now working perfectly
Dispite the issues I had with these earbuds just by judging from comfort and sound, these are the best earbuds I've ever owned
I bought these because of other reviews I had read of them
I play drums and sing background
They sound better than the Shures' that came with my monitor system
It beats carrying around a 50 lb
wedge (that feeds back)
I use a pair of these for all of my general headphone applications (I have another set of cans for studio use though)
These sound great
I was concerned with physical ear fatigue from wearing relatively heavy drivers in-ear, but I've had no such problems
I find them impossible to fit properly so they sound like crap and fall out
You are supposed to wrap the cord around your ear and it is just a huge PITA
I've had them for 2 years, tried everything off and on, always end up frustrated and sorry I wasted money
These Shure ear phones are the greatest sounding ear phones I have ever had
And the true sound isolation is beautiful
I even was able to listen and approve a time sensitive audio mix sent to me in a gymnasium during a basketball game
Almost total isolation
It was quite strange listening to music as the players beat on each other mercilessly
It lent a cinematic quality
Anyway I would highly recommend these
There is a bit of a learning curve to the correct placement in the ears
But once you figure that out you are set
After my $50 Ultimate Ears broke within 2 months, I bought these on impulse
The wire on my prior earbuds pretty much tore and the left ear stopped working
Once I read in one of the reviews that these Shure earbuds have a very sturdy wire, I was pretty much sold because I was so mad about my old ones breaking
When I first receives these in the mail, I was quite confused
How do you put them in your ear
I had to read the little manual sheet to realize that the wire goes over and behind your ear, not like most earbuds
I admit, at first, these were a bit awkward to wear, but after a while, you get the hang of it and they slip on your ear perfectly
I love dubstep, so I listen to music with a lot of bass, and these earbuds perform
The wire is also very sturdy, just as the review stated; wire is very strong and won't rip
I definitely recommend these earbuds, they are well worth the three digits
For 3 months, I struggled with the correct way to wear these
But once I managed, they're pretty balanced buds
I can only imagine what 315 or 425 would sound like
These are great for blocking noise and focusing on the sound that they put out without being disturbed
As a drummer these are perfect monitors, just the right amount of everything
I have tried different types of headphones before some in the $100 range, and nothing comes close
I would say they could use a bit more bass, but overall they are great and I still give them a 5 out of 5
I wish the cable was about a food longer, and a built-in volume control would have been a nice touch, however you can always get one
Will I recommend it
Yes
I purchased these because I needed headphone at the gym that did not fall out easily
I was super impressed by the sound
The sound quality was nearly identical to my $350 Bose QC3 headphones
The only gripe was the breaking in the wire so that it looped around my ear easily
There is definitely a learning curve when putting these headphones on, but after about a week, it becomes second nature
The sound quality is excellent, and they fit snug in your ear canal
I also like having the additional ear buds'
I use these as both In Ear Monitors while on stage, as well as normal headphones with my iPhone
The noise cancellation is fantastic, and the sound quality is very clear and crisp
Although it is a single driver, there is a nice blend of bass, midrange and treble
I have listened to everything from acoustic to metal, and can pick out everything in the mix
On stage they are great
I use them in conjunction with aviom in ear monitoring controls and they allow me to hear the entire band very well
For the price, they are a great product and I hope to one day be able to step up to dual or triple drivers
But for now, these work wonderfully within my musician's more meager budget
if you like the noise from outside block out when you have your earphones on, this is something to consider
The Shure SE215 worked great for the first two days, then the right speaker started to cut in and out
Ok corny title but I had to do it
Everyone needs to find their sound
I found them in shure headphones
These are by far the best balanced in ear headphones I have heard
I have tried Sennheiser MM50, Klipsch image s4, Apple in-ear headphones, and my Shure ec2 (R
I
P
) headphones
Nothing to me compares to shure headphones
The sound is so crisp and clean compared to the others
MM50 sounded muddy and did the apple in-ears
S4's sounded very tinny (hurt my ears on the high end) Shure headphones have none of that
Tight bass, good highs, and maybe you can make an argument the mid range is lacking a bit but that shortcoming is quick overcome with the overall sound quality
Like my older ec2 (which I used a few times a week before they died 6 years later) the new SE 215 did not disappoint
I really suprised
The ear phone is great
and It was really reasonable rate
I really hope buy this kind of item at Amazon, too
This is my first set of IEMs I've owned
I've always been using earbuds from Sony and other random brands
I was apprehensive at dropping $99 on a pair of earphones, since my previous ones would always die within a few months of having them
However, I found that my fears were unfounded after receiving these
The sound quality is phenomenal, I haven't owned anything like this before
I listen to electronic music mostly (trance), and the highs and lows are pretty balanced on these
The bass response is pretty good, it's not too heavy, but I think it's definitely enough for my own enjoyment
I've lost track of how many hours I've listened with these, but they are really comfortable and don't hurt after wearing them for hours and hours
I enjoy using the Comply foam tips that come with mine, the sound isolation is excellent
It isolates so well that I cannot wear both pieces in my ears while I'm at work, since I cannot hear what my coworkers say to me even if I have the volume pretty low
I can use both the medium and small Comply tips; if I use the mediums, I have to compress the foam and then insert them into my ears, but with the smalls I can just slip them in and I still get the same seal
The only complaint I have with these is that the stock cable that comes with the earphones are a little awkward to use for the first time
I had trouble trying to get the memory wire fitted around my ears properly
Once they were on properly, they were pretty comfortable
I don't really recommend wearing these in combination with glasses though, they might feel weird
I like that the cables are thick and Kevlar-reinforced; I have no worries about the durability of the cable, and it can easily replaced if it tears
I also bought the CBL-M+-K-EFS so I could use it with my iPod and iPhone
I like the fitting of this cable more, since there's no memory wire, so it's more comfortable to use while wearing glasses
I think that if these ever break down, I might try out the se215-LTD
I might even try out some of Shure's higher offerings
I originally bought the Dr
Dre Powerbeats and returned them immediately
After reading several reviews I decided to buy the Shure SE215
I just used them for a 75 minute session on the stationary bike
I could not hear any noise at all from any of the pieces of equipment min use around me so the noise isolation is outstanding
Being an audiophile I found the the sound very well balanced with very good bass extension
They were not affected by moisture at all and stayed firmly in my ears for the entire session
I extremely impressed
Summary:-This is my 4th pair of Shure's
-Owned E2C's and older models
-These are the best (and cheapest) so far
-I use custom molded castings of my ear-canals made by my ear-doctor and the sound isolation/sound quality is absolutely amazing
I'm a helicopter pilot and use them for hearing-protection everyday
-Slightly less comfortablePros:-Bass is deeper and more pronounced than other models I've owned
I'm very particular about sound and like a good balance
have to say that the bass is unquestionably an improvement
I use a graphic equalizer with my player and these have a much broader range of adjustability
some people say they have too much bass, but if you actually take the time to adjust your equalizer, you'll find that you just have more control
The bass response is therefor quite satisfying as it is never pushing the driver near any limits
Rich, deep, period
-Shure's have always been my go-to brand but I've always broken the wires by month 12-14
The modular wire system in these new models is pretty much the answer to that problem
-They look cool
especially with my clear ear-canal castings
Cons:-They don't fit in the ear as well as previous models
a little big so they contact my cartiladge and irritate it over time if not adjusted properly
I suspect that it is my custom ear-canal inserts so I wouldn't worry about it unless you're going that route
-Because of ^ and the fact that the wire-plug can swivel, they take a little longer to put on/take off
you kinda have to get everything all setup before you pop it under your hair/glasses and into your ear
I think if you have never owned a pair of noise cancelling headphones these might be OK
However, they are no where near as good when it comes to quietness
In addition, you hear the cord movement and they are not that comfortable
Very good but hard to put it on it took me almost an hour to put it on but not bad
These headphones are absolutely amazing
Normally I don't write reviews about things I buy, but these made me get online and do it
10/10
So for number of years I have tried to find some of the best headphones whether it's been in ear or over the ear, and I had my doubts about these in-ear headphones at first
I did not realize that they need a "Burn-in" time frame which may vary from what I have researched
The biggest thing with these headphones will be the getting used to the in-ear placement of the headphone itself
I will stress this, you will need time getting used to these being in your ear's for a long period of time, but once you make it past that point you will be go to go
Now as far as performance, I would have to say they are stellar and are a cut above the rest
The high's are crisp and tight
The mid's are are not all over the place like cheaper headphones
The lows are the closest thing to being in the studio
The cord is very durable
Now for the bad
The cord is not long enough since you do have to where the cord behind you since they are sound monitors not regular headphones
The different headphone sizes are great but are a pain when trying to remove them or switch them out
The "Burn-in" time may be a little too long for some users
All in all, if you are looking to upgrade your in-ear headphones for better quality sound and performance these are the ones for you
I used to work in the Production Arts world, and have been a Shure fan for many years
For running I had used Shure E2C for almost a decade
I had the same pair the whole time, running dozens of races, dragging through almost two years of abuse in Iraq and still they kept on
Finally they shorted out and I sadly went looking for a replacement
I gave the SE 215's a try
Within a month the mount on one ear broke
I paid for shipping, sent it off to Shure, their customer service was great, they fixed it and sent it back for free
A month later they broke again
I guess I could send them off again, still under warranty, but no desire
My faith in these things is lost, and I will be trying to find something better to keep up with my lifestyle
When it comes to audio quality, I have a very specific taste
I like booming bass, but not over-exagerated and fake - real bass
I like CLEAR vocals, and being able to distinguish all the different instruments and layers in music
Previously, I bought a pair of Klipsch Image X10's, and I thought they were amazing
However, they were a little fuzzy and sort of unclear
Deffinitely not worth the $350 I shelled out considering they broke in about 6 months after normal daily use
The connecter to the device completely broke, and made them worthless
Klipsch may have good sound quality, but they REALLY need to put a little more effort into the build quality
I did some research after those broke, and came across these
I was skeptical of the round ear tips because I have VERY small ear canals, and only Klipsch's pattented oval ear tips fit my ears
Of course, I was right to worry because when I tried the ear tips that came with these, I was scared I had just wasted more money
However, I thought, why not take two great brands and combine them
I took my old Klipsch ear tips and sure enough they fit like a glove on my new Shure SE215's
And thus, the BEST HEADPHONES ON THE PLANET are born
The sound quality on these bad boys is just OUTSTANDING
It fit all my requirements and even more
PERFECT amount of bass, clear vocals, and no part of the music is left unheard
I was just simply blow away by the sound quality
(I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50's, so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to sound quality
What makes these headphones even better is the tank-like build quality
I feel like these could be runover countless times by cars and never break
I would suggest getting the clear instead of the black - they look SICK - the cable looks silver and it will never get dirty unlike ordinary white headphones - you can see all the components and drivers through the clear housing and it's just a really cool design
These headphones are a STEAL for $100
What else can I say
Shure, you've done it again
I am a frequent amazon shopper and in my opinion Amazon is an absolute first retailer go to even though Ive had complications with shipments before
Every time they've alleviated my complications swiftly
I gave this item a four star review to not necessarily contribute an opinion on the product but to actually share my service experience with their customer support
In a word, AMAZING
My shipment seems to have been stolen from my door, but Amazon heard me out and sent me another one
I don't know if its because Im a prime member (definitely worth it) but they definitely will try their best to satisfy you
Shop With Confidence
Amazon will not let their customers down
Just be an honest buyer and they will make sure your expectations are met with satisfaction
Also I will review this product once I receive it
Once again, Thank you AMazon
If you are familiar with Shure products, you are probably comfortable with the fit and plastic / foam ear tips
These work as on any other Shure product
I got these after my beloved E2c earphones finally started dying
So sad to end up with the 215s
The bottom end is very muddled and there's too much of the lower end in the mix
This set lacks the pristine quality of the E2c
The mids and highs are very clear, but the bass distracts quite a bit
I've had a number of Shure ear buds, and I've always been happy with them
These looked a little clunky, but, what the heck
Shure's been doing this for years, they must have done the homework, right
Wrong
Even after a month, it's a struggle to get these things in my ears
Have to look at the "r" and "l" signs every time, and even then I'm futzing with them for a couple of minutes before they are in properly
and that stupid stiff wire is always twisting the wrong way so you have to keep pulling it back over your ear
The sound is great, but it's just not worth the hassle
DO NOT BUY
I got these and was very excited because the sound is very good
However, after only one month and a week, the left earbud lost sound and would only be audible if i twisted the earbud to one specific angle
As these wrap around your earbud, that one specific angle was impossible to hold
Because of this, these headphones are now useless
Great sound but poorly built
Also, the warranty is only one month, so do not expect any full refund
I have been a fan of Shure headphones for years
This is my third pair and by far the best yet
The fit is great and sound quality is superb
A great <$100 set of headphones
So originally i had the beats solo head phones
they definitely were not worth $ 200
00, these shure's are amazing and they sound great
the noise cancellation are really good
i can not have my i pod playing the too loud as im playing my drums because i cant even hear what im playing
I owned a pair of Shure headphones a few years ago but the cord has ripped and I have been using other pairs that came with my ipod or a pair of Skullcandys
I remember my old ones and I was looking forward to getting these, they were a christmas gift
I have no complaints except that maybe they could be a little louder, but then I may just go deaf so it may not be a bad thing they dont go louder
Overall excellent noise reduction you cant hear nothing when you have these on
The sound stays clear even when all the way turned up
Cord can be replaced if it ever rips, a huge plus for me as i have seen many headphones come and go but thanks to these Shure's the cord can just be replaced
As you wear them in they get more comfortable and you will enjoy them once you find the right fit for yourself
So if your in the market for a great pair of headphones these are a great pair to consider
They don't fit wellThe right ear occasionally cuts out
(after maybe 5 uses)The cord is rigid and conducts sound (think: tin can and cord telephone)The sound is OK
I have been happier with $40 Sony earbuds
They say that you will notice a huge difference between headphone sound quality once you spend that first $100
These headphones fit nicely as I like the wrap around style and the sound quality was nice but compared to a cheap pair of $30 skull candies I had I heard no difference
This is because there is still only one driver
If you want a pair of headphones with night and day difference in sound quality compared to regular headphones then get a pair with at least two drivers
This of course means you'll be dropping at least $200
These are easily that best head phones that i have ever had, i got these to replace my beats audio which gave out on me
super comfortable, if you are the bubble of getting a pair, go for it, you will not regret
They are great sounding headphones, but if you are wanting to use them at a gym setting the time it takes to put them in properly can be a pain
Just stick to great sounding ear buds in that setting
Overall reasonably good sound and they appear to be sturdily built
However the bass, touted in the promo blurb, is really not all that good, And, I do use the expandable ear buds
I have less expensive earphones with as good or better bass response
For less then a hundred dollars you cannot go wrong with these
The fit takes a little practice but once u get them on  They won't fall off
Pro's:- Earbuds sounded good when they were in
Con's:- Difficult to put in ears
- Once in ears they were uncomfortable
- Earbuds are heavy and the cord is heavy
- Cord was way to long for walking around and having come out of pocket
- Sound cuts in and out on iphone 4 when the connector rotates the plug
- Fit kit sleeves were extremely difficult to remove when trying to find a good fit
Internet forums said to freeze the earbuds to help
- The cord nearest the earbuds is made to wrap around the ear
Made it more difficult to put on and with the combined weight of the cord bothered my ears
All in all these were not for me
I have had a few great over the ear monitors in my life and was not prepared for the hassle they would be
They hurt my ears, cut in and out and needed to be frozen to adjust
I like the idea of earplugs with great sound but not with all this hassle
According to the reviews many people love them, but I STRONGLY suggest you give these or earbuds very similar a try before you buy
I returned them
You might love them
Who knows
Although advertised as fitting those who like fidelity of music, they did not fit to my ears to make the sensation of being isolated from the outside
There are a lot of reviews here that talk about technical specifics about the SE 215's
I'd like to take a different approach to offer my praise (for the record, I'm a music composer/producer and sound quality means worlds to me)
When my wife found out these were $100 she was none too pleased
"$100 for earbuds
Seems excessive to me," she said
I tried to explain the quality and durability of the SE 215's but she wasn't hearing it
When they arrived and I had her listen to a few songs through these, she was grinning like the Cheshire Cat
It was the "crap I know I'm wrong about these so how do I hide it
" grin
When I asked her if she thought they were worth the money, she began to comment how effective the sound-isolating was (all of a sudden she couldn't hear me)
Agree with a lot of folks here
Impeccable clarity, profound bass, ridiculous sound
Stop thinking about buying these and buy them
Worth every penny
Awesome sound
A little bit awkward fit in the ears, but you get used to it
Comparable to the $400 head phones out there
What a waste of money
For $100 the sound is lame
The design is awful as they don't fit in a normal ear and should have came with a shoe horn to cram them in your ear
Once in your ear the sound is muffled by the cheap cushions put on the end
In the continuation of poor design
The plug into my iPhone is too wide to get past the bumper
I had another set of Shure headphone that needed to be replaced because of faulty wiring
Poorly designed and contructed products
NEVER AGAIN
Buy the JBuds J3M Micro Atomic In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Mic (Jet Black)
At $25 these exceeded all my expectations and have a microphone to boot
Pros: Sound great,lots of clean bass, wide range, sound isolating, quality tips, detachable headphones, comfortableCons: Putting these in is harder than it should be, may not work with phone or music player case, not a very secure fit, cut out every once in a while for just a split second(almost only during heavy lifting though)
These sound really great
You need to find the right earpiece for your ear as they may not fit well into a helmet if they protrude too much
I use ear bud headphones solely for riding on my motorcycle
I usually have the rubber tipped kind but went with the foam tip for these
The foam tips block as much outside sound as an actual foam ear plug design to block sound
It's great for wind noise inside my helmet
I find myself turning the volume way down as I can still hear my music while blocking the damaging wind/engine noise, and I can still hear my environment
They also lay completely flat in my ear, and the cord that wraps around my ear does a great job of keeping the ear bud in place, even in my helmet
Sound quality is also fantastic for the price
Cord is super durable
I like that the cord is also replaceable/interchangeable
Definitely recommend
Bought it for my son
He really enjoys using them
Says they cancel out the sound great
Either he is telling the truth or he has gotten better at ignoring me and my wife
Ha
I had other ear buds from Shure that I loved and had great sound, so I trusted the company and bought these as a replacement
But they're not good
I don't know what the other people reviewing them have been listening to, but there are songs that I know have a low bass, which can't be heard on these at all
They're also surprisingly uncomfortable because the buds themselves are really thick and the hard plastic is actually jamming itself against my ear (no change in the latex piece helps this problem)
But mostly, they have no low bass (I listen to a lot of electronic music-- they're the worst for psytrance
) and are pretty much only acceptable for listening to podcasts
I lent them to a friend who was surprised that Shure made them because they're so bad
Not worth the money
When I listen to songs I know, I am disappointed with the sound quality
I purchased these due to the super low price Amazon had
I own a few pairs of other earbuds/headphones and my previous favorites were my Klipsch S4
I assumed there is a plateau for all earbuds and any increase in quality would be negligible
I was wrong in my assumptions
The Klipsch S4 fit comfortably in my ear, but the bass was low
Even putting my iPhone on "Bass Boost", it isn't what you would want it to be
To obtain more bass, I assumed (again) that I would have to purchase a larger earbud that would be uncomfortable or transition to over the ear headphones
These were not good options since I use my earbuds to workout
I purchased the Shure SE215-CL and I was blown away
It is amazing how clear these are
More bass and the highs were more crisp
The style was awkward at first, but now I like it more than the in the ear earbuds
Even my Klipsch would slip when I would sweat a lot
No environmental noise is allowed in my ear, just crisp, clean music
I actually gave my Klipsch earbuds away
These are that good
I bought these as a replacement to my Sony XBA-1iP, which were rather lacking on the lows especially
Not only do the Shure SE215s have beautiful sounding lows, the sound coming out of these is beautiful in general; very well balanced
I found the factory default covers to fit my ears just fine, but there are plenty of alternatively sized covers that come included in a resealable bag that can be left in the carrying case, which is also included
However, for about the first week of use, the fit for these did take getting used to as I've never owned a pair of earphones before in which the cord goes behind the ear
After getting used to it, the fit on these are suburb - you can easily use them for hours on end
In regards to noise isolation, the manual these come with says "Wear them like you would a pair of earplugs" and boy, do they make for great earplugs
That said, the noise isolation on these is so great - even at a low volume - that it can pose a hazard if you plan on going for a walk/jog with these on
Plain and simple, these sound great, they fit great, and they're great for listening over extended periods of time
The sound in as advertised--balanced, nice bass, great definition of all instruments, no complaint there
But, they are a bugger to get fit into the ear correctly and then move the cord over the ear easily
Once the wrangling of the cord is done, they are fine
If you are planning on using these a lot to work out with, as I do, be prepared for some issues with how the cord hangs and cups or forms behind your ear
Otherwise, for any other activity, sweet headphones
First off let me say "audiophiles" are pretentious idiots
I'm a producer/audio engineer and I read these audiophile reviews and I start laughing
I love the fact that they are engage listeners but really their reviews are more of ego stroking then anything else
Anytime someone tells you they are an audiophile, take their review with a grain of salt because they are really no more knowledgeable then you are
It takes a LOT of training and experience (as in a college degree in psychoacoustics & 20 years of experience)to be able to be able to pick apart sound the way they try to
Personally I've only met a handful of people who were brilliant enough to be able to do that
All the equipment in the audio chain is going to color the sound and what sounds muddy or distorted on one persons setup might sound crystal clear on another
Everyone's ears are different, no one has perfect hearing
Most people over a certain age lose the ability to hear certain high frequencies, so you have no idea if they will interpret the sound the same way you will
Keep in mind that it's all subjective and you really need to listen for yourself
That said these are the best in ear monitors (IEM) that I have ever used and I've used some very expensive IEMs
Yes they color the sound just like anything else but they nailed exactly what I like
I love the bass response and on my setup they have a very well defined sound
I'm actually blown away by how much they sound like my Mackie and Genelec studio monitors (which have a more pronounced bass) and I think I can actually work using them (I have never felt that way before)
I listened to a couple of my tracks on them and they sounded EXACTLY how they sounded when I made them, this is so crazy to me that it's almost absurd
These $99 IEMs somehow manage to sound as good as my professional studio equipment which cost me thousands of dollars
I'm blown away to say the least
I would absolutely recommend checking them out and I'd advise you to listen to a variety of music from different sources (CD, MP3, home stereo, iPod, etc) before you make a decision
Don't be surprised if some songs sound terrible on them while others sound better then ever
The reason is the flaws in the production can be way more pronounced because the original artist/engineer might not have been able to hear what you can hear with these
The lesson here is quality doesn't always make for a better listening experience, sometimes the lack of fidelity and a bit of distortion can actually make the music more enjoyable
Which is why its so laughable when audiophiles go on and on about clarity, fidelity and frequency response
As for the build quality & wire, etc
it's all top notch
The ability to replace damaged wires is just excellent and I really think that I'll get my money's worth out of them (even if they die in a year)
N-Joy
These are the nicest earphones in terms of sound quality, durability, and for blocking outside noise
These are perfect for any situation where you don't want or need to hear anything outside your music
Great for airplanes, long car rides, loud public places, studying, etc
I'll even use them to fall asleep when my roommates are still partying or being loud when I'm going to bed
When exercising, you can wear them pointed up and have the cord wrap over and around the backside of the ear for a more secure fit
I like to use the foam tips: they're like the earplugs that you squeeze and put in your ears, and then they expand to the shape of your ear canal and block outside noise
As a company, Shure supply's almost every big name musician and performer at large large venue shows with both their high quality earphones and microphone equipment
They far exceed every other brand in terms of sound quality produced
For noise blocking earphones on a $100 budget, there's no reason to get anything other than the SE215's
They'll even replace them for free if you keep a receipt, and they've done this for me and other people I know with their earphones that have broken long after a 2-year period
I had the first generation model for a while and the cord malfunctioned and they upgraded me to the newer model at no cost
With this current model they've deigned the earphones so that the cord detaches from the buds at the base of your ear, so that if and when the cord breaks, you don't need to go buy a whole new pair, just replace the cord
This is also great for if and when you want to upgrade to their higher end models like the SE315, SE425, and SE535 (each higher number is about $100 more than the previous) because the cord works for all of the current SE series earphones
Just swap out the buds on the same cord
Once you try any model of Shure's earphones, you will never want to buy another company's earphones
They come with a few styles of different tips, each in small, medium, and large, and their carrying case is quite nice
Ask anyone you know with Shure earphones and they will gladly tell how how awesome the earphones are
10/10
Great sound, great material quality
I found them a little too big for my ears (part of the hard plastic pushes a bit on my skin and after a long period of time, it leaves a small mark), but I don't really notice it until I take them off
Its a little complicated getting used to putting them on correctly, but once they're on, they stay on great
Considering the price, I would buy these again
Best earphones I've owned for around 100 dollars
Sadly, my puppy (back then) chewed them up as well as the replacement pair I begrudgingly bought after those
Needless to say after $300 and no headphones to show for it, I was reticent about purchasing a new pair
As with the old pairs, these new SE215s can only be heard to be appreciated
They no longer come with the christmas tree fitting that looked more like a torture device
But that's beside the point
The fittings you're interested in are the expanding earplug styles in small, medium, & large
There's a band I'm an avid fan of and I've been listening to all of their albums for roughly 15 years now
Before I owned Shure headphones, I thought I knew every melody and note in every song of theirs
What I failed to realize was that with headphones which allowed true noise cancellation (not BS electronic white-noise) I was able to listen to far lower volumes
Confused
I was too
At such low volumes, you can hear what would have otherwise been drowned out by the louder elements of the same song
The added bonus was riding the subway on the C line to work from Brooklyn to Manhattan and the normal cacophony of f-bombs and arguments became a silent movie to whichever track I chose that morning
Bonus points for faster tempo music during fist fights
There are two honest drawbacks despite my fanboy appreciation of these headphones audio quality

When someone needs to talk to you for example while working at your desk, they're a pain in the ass to keep scrunching and putting back into your ear
Doubly so with this new over the ear design (which also takes a little practice)
2
The realization that you don't clean your ears as well as you think you do
Don't believe me
There's a reason they come with an ear-wax removal tool
Gross
I bought the SE215-K in Black for the 2012 Christmas Holiday
Very well constructed unit
The earbuds / drivers have a solid construction to them, and the cable is sturdy
Sound Quality: ExcellentIsolation: Excellent - (Too Good actually, more on this later
)Price: ReasonableIntended use: Office workAfter using these at the office for the better part of a month, these are great at isolating me from noisy co-workers
When fitted properly the comfort and sound on these monitors are excellent
Some minor things to note:The isolation is very good
This can be a downside, as I would not recommend these for people who require situational awareness, such as running
The if you are not used to earbuds the fit can take some time to get used to
Make sure you have the correct earbud in the correct ear
It's easy to mix them up, and the fit suffers terribly if you do that
The sound quality is really good, they are comfortable and noise-isolating, and the price is right
Unfortunately within two months of buying them the cable gave out and would only transmit a soft intermittent signal
The the credit of the designers the ear buds easily detach so you can replace just the cable rather than the whole unit
This is a step up from the last Shure earphones I owned which were attached to the cable and had to be discarded when it broke (after many years of use)
The part that's tough to swallow is that the cable is over $30
A pair of standard Apple headphones, complete with ear buds and remote control, retails for $29 and is notoriously over-priced
It would be easier to shrug off if there weren't so many reports in the reviews of cables breaking
If the cable was high-quality enough to justify the high price tag, it wouldn't break so often
I believe that part of the problem is in the old-fashioned, bulky, L-shaped design of the jack which is ill-suited to pocket devices
As you move around during the day the jack can rotate perpendicular to the device so it hangs off the edge, which can subject it to stress that's not an issue with a straight jack
I have used Shure earphone for many years and have been pleased with the quality and durability
The SE series, however,  uses a connector at the base of the earpiece which creates a poor sound quality when engaging in exercise such as running
Apparently the connector pin used to attach the cord to the earbud rotates within the fitting when the user is engaged in movement
A cutting in and our of the sound results
The review and recommended self-repair at the following link is informative:  [
]
Bottom line:  Don't use these earphones if you intend to exercise while wearing them
These are by far the best headphones I've used
The only minor negative is that they are a chore to put into my ears
But the sound is more that worth it
Good: for $100 bucks you seriously can't beat this sound quality
it is the best
I used to have shure e4c but when they broke I decided to buy cheaper ones and since I know and trust shure for their customer service I went with them again this time with 215
This headphones delivers quality sound at the cheapest entry price for any In Ear Monitors
durability, sound quality, packaging, customer support all is best of the breed
Enough said, i'd pick this pair over etyomotic , bose, logitech, ultrasound  any day (and I say this cuz I've tried all of those brands)
Bad: the fit on this headphone is weird (unlike e4c) and subjective
If I get the right fit, then it feels as if you dont even have a headphones on and that is the good part, however when you don't get the right fit, you just are left struggling and it may even hurt your ears (not pleasant)
Because the fit is so weird, it does take good 1 min to put it on correctly and takes some effort to take it out
For something as used as earphones this shouldn't be the case
But again other than the FIT i don't have any complains with this pair, hence 4 stars
Update 9/13/2013: As originally suspected, it still hurt in my ears after prolonged (10-20 mins max) use
No matter how I put it on, with whichever sleeve, its a problem
However still best durability and sound quality for $100
I was looking primarily for quality of build/longevity, and secondly, sound quality
You can't go wrong with this pair
Built sturdy
The cord is the best quality I have seen (even reinforced where it wraps above your ear)
The sound quality is great
These days, companies sell their units bragging it has "deep bass" and such
These units have well-balanced lows, mids, and highs
(I rather rely on my EQ anyway, if I wanted higher lows or highs, for example)
While the noise cancellation worked well, the low range bass seemed non existent
Even doing bass boost on iPod was not enough
Also the in-ear fit was difficult
Overall very disappointed in the product
Bought Bose ear buds for same price and am very happy
These IEMs are great
As an entry level audiophile I searched the web high and low to find the best pair of IEMs for me and I'm happy to say that I think the SE215's are them
This is my third or fourth set up nicer IEMs and all I can say is that these have absolutely no business sounding this good
For less than $100 you are going to change the way that you think about music
The only word of caution that I give is to give the memory cable some time, a few of my friends (whom I convinced to buy some 215s) loved the sound but simply couldn't get used to the way that the cord laid over their ears -- after a bit of time they too fell in love though
I have had these earbuds approximately one month now, and I couldn't be more satisfied
When looking to purchase earbuds, I did a ton of research and ended up choosing these
I am not an audiophile, but I do care a great deal about sound quality
I wanted a headphone with realistic sound, a head phone that allowed me to pick up on every detail of the music
To me, these do just that
The musical versatility is great as well
I can go from listening to jazz or Western art music, where the sound is very clear and each instrument is easily heard, to dropping a ton of bass with some dubstep
I really like how these earbuds do not over-exaggerate the bass
Have you tried listening to Beethoven with Beats headphones
It's awful
Their desire to blow your skull up with bass only make listening to certain genres of music enjoyable
The bass the Shure SE215 earbuds make is true to the music; if the music has a lot of bass, these headphones will provide some head thumping lows
If the music doesn't have a lot of bass, these headphones will make the music sound lively with great mid and high tones
I would not recommend getting these earbuds for use with activities, such as weight lifting, running or sports
They block out so much noise that you only hear the music playing
This can make these activities dangerous
It is impossible to have a conversation with someone while these are in
TL;DR Version
THE GOOD:  -Great, realistic sound  -Deep, head bumping bass when appropriate  -Noise isolating  -Quality feel  -Thick cable that is replaceable  -Traveling case includedTHE BAD:  -Headphones are inconvenient for short use (they have to set, you can't just stick them strait in your ear like normal earbuds)  -The cable is hard for a few inches below the earbud connection, making the cable get caught easily while moving with these  -Headphones are not suitable for physical activities due to noise isolationI would highly recommend these earbuds
They are a great way to escape the noisy world and enjoy your music on a whole other level
Great product
I've used them for about 2months with no issues
I like that I can purchase a phone cord and replace the cord it came with so I can make/receive calls and play/stop music
Awesome product
I bought these Shure SE 215 a few months ago,and I was looking forward to using these highly rated (by their advertising) earphones
First of all, the over the ear wiring is cumbersome to use, particularly if you like to just put them on and start listening to music
They take a certain amount of playing with to get them just right, and then they take a fair amount of getting used to
This is not a plus
Secondly, I thought the music quality was a little tinny and vague, almost like listening in a tunnel, with the music way in the background
I thought it must be me, so recently I did a comparison with all of my earphones, and guess what, these earphones are definitely inferior to many of the earphones out there, which cost less than half as much
I compared five different sets, with many different music types, and compared the same tracks for each earphone set, to try and be objective
The SE215 performed poorly
I compared a $ 29
00 set of iLuvs, a set of original equipment iPod earphones, a $ 12
00 set of iLuvs, a set of Sharper Image ( about $15
00) and the Shures
The SE 215 were last in the comparison for the reasons I mentioned above, but primarily the sound was far inferior to the others, although the Sharper Image versions were only a little better
By far the two best were the $ 29
00 iLuvs and the original equipment earphones that came with the iPod
I would definitely say, save your money do not get these SE 215s
I feel that the iLuvs are the best value for the money (of these compared)
I also have a pair of Sony noise cancelling earphones, which I did not use for this comparison as I thought that might be an unfair comparison, and those sound really good too
I understand all of us hear differently, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt, you may hear something I didn't
Hope someone finds this helpful
I find it ironic that the first ear buds by Shure to have replaceable wires also have the most reinforced wires
These sound great to me, and you can get all of the technical details from the other reviewers
I have owned the E2Cs and SE210s, and these are my favorites out of the batch
excellent headphones for me one of the best on the market with a spectacular presentation and a size suitable for the man who uses it every day and a high quality material like the sound
Sounded great until one ear started going on and off
The went right back
I just ordered the x10 to replace them
I'm not a pro at judging audio quality on headphones
I upgraded to these from the Creative EP-630i and I have to say these are awesome
They block out so much sound I could use them on the airplane as earplugs to fall asleep
Not good for crossing roads though
I wear them around the top of the ears like other reviewers and I like how the stress areas of the cables are kevlar-reinforced for extra durability
The cables are also completely replaceable so nevermind if you break, fray or cut them accidentally
Tip: These earphones aren't as translucent as the photos show them to be
They do look cool though, I'd give you that
Pros-Great sound (I'm going to ignore specifics, there are plenty of reviews on that)-Awesome, Awesome, Awesome cord
Seriously, this is the best cord I have ever seen-Good carrying case-moderately good selection of eartips (the meelectronics mi-6 hi-fi's have 6 pairs that are all very different, these are all very similar)Con-the foam eartips are incredibly hard to get off and look pretty bad after being used
I much prefer the silicone tips
Overall, these are very worth it
This pair, is worth the money
The fit is a bit odd, but I got used to it in a week
Overall sound quality is not as good as my Klipsch Image S4s
These have excellent noise isolation and bass, but the mids and highs are not quite as good as the S4s
The cable is durable, but the fitting of these earphones is awkward
extremely uncomfortable for long period of live singing
I stick to more comfortable buds
I use  a pair of Bose e2 which are very very comfortable
Great sounds and changing the modes of my hp music I get to hear the diff
settings very well
Good bass and clarity overall and seals were superb
Fits lightly and easily into ear
Cables are a bit rough to handle perhaps but this could be good to avoid entanglement
Bought this to compare with my UE at similar price [100usd]
this is much better and wished I got this first
Great entry model for musicians and audiophiles
I use this for studio drumming and church playing (boxed up drumset)
I got this one for my husband, it should be his favorite brand, but he didn't love this one that much because of the sound quality did not meet his expectation
The pros for this is the price
For $100 you got a Shure product, I think that is pretty fair for the quality
Excellent IEMs
Great bass and good midrange
You can't go wrong with these headphones
Way better than Bose, or beats by dre
I love these inears
I got them for my inear monitor to use on stage at church and end up using them for everything from flying to listening to my ipod
I think I get a second pair for personal use and one for work
The sound quality is pretty good but the price is a little too high
There's a lot of high ends in the earphones and it lacks the low ends
But over all I'm satisfied
The earphones are quality material and quality sound
They're slightly difficult to put on comfortably, but once they're in, the sound is amazing
Unfortunately the right earbud broke within two months
Luckily Shure offers a 2-year warranty, i just have to pay for shipping & they do repairs for free
Are they good
Well yes
They worth the money
But
You're gonna need to spend another $50 to get Shure Phone Cable if you want to listen music on your phone
Why
Because the plug on default cable is so annoyingly bad it will lose connection with the phone on every slightest move
Even if you don't need a mic, you still gonna need to buy the cable
And you cannot get earphones with already installed phone cable
I miss a pin on the cable
It's slightly heavier than other earphone cables and absolutely needs something that you can pin it to the shirt
Also Shure support left me unhappy
One of the sleeves came damaged
There is a few spares each of different size, but you get only two medium ones
So I asked them to send me one
They told me to call them and order
Here on Amazon, those spares listed for $20
I explained them that the sleeve came damaged, and just because of one sleeve I don't want to send the whole thing back
They refused to send me a replacement and it seems after all I'm gonna need to spend another 20 and buy them myself
So in the end these earphones will cost me in total ~ $170+tax
Is there any better options for that price
Sure, there are plenty
Good headphones, but they trick you to spend more
BTW
It took me almost a month to find a way to properly get them in my ears
Remember, place the earpiece the way that logo would be laying horizontally and would be readable (it should not be upside down), and then turn the cable downwards, so the whole thing will look like G letter and not the way how it looks on the picture
At the point where cable connects to the earpiece, it easily rotates
And don't waste your time bending the cable behind your ears as it says in the manual
I am a believer
My boyfriend recommended these for our upcoming trip
I was considering Bose noise cancelling, but did not want the bulk
These come in a very compact bag and cancel out the jet noise and chatter on planes
I also bring them to work now so I don't hear the background noises of chatter, keyboards, phone calls, pagers that can irritate me
Excellent 100 bucks spent
Sound quality is awesome
I ended up returning them though because they are a pain to put on
I gave it a few days of use just to see if it'll get easier but they are just not easy to put on
One of the sides also kept coming out
great sound isolation
very good music reproduction
the fit takes time to get used to
very weird feeling at first
i would recommend these to a friend or enemy
I play on stage about twice a month where in ear monitors are used
These block out the sound in the room while giving me clear sound in my ears
The sound quality is what would be expected from SURE and the construction is great
The cord is long enough to wear as in ear monitors and the construction is very durable
They fit and stay in the ears great once you find a foam piece that fits
All kinds of sizes come with these headphones so finding a pair that fits wont require seeking aftermarket stuff
I highly recommend these headphones
Pros: GREAT sound, sturdy cables, detachable cable from the ear bud (amazing idea - brilliant)Cons: cables don't wrap well around ears - or I"m challenged possibly, cables too heave to stay behind ears when working out in any vigorous manner
For example, bend at waist and hang from the hips, buds fall out and cables unwrap
Utterly frustrating
I have used Shure earbuds for a few years now and have loved each of the two pairs I have owned in the past
I received the SE 215-K model of earbuds on Saturday and have used them a few times now
The sound that these produce is as superb as my previous ones but I don't like how these fit
The hard plastic part that fits into the outer ear is not comfortable and the thick wire that wraps around my ears is too thick
These are just very uncomfortable
I can only stand to have them in my ears for about fifteen minutes at a time
This is bad considering that I wore my other ones all day with no discomfort at all
I wish I would have just bought a new pair of the older model
When my Bose IE2 broke, I was in doubt of what earphones to buy for my daily walkings
I needed great sound, comfort, durability
So I've bought these: Klipsch S4, a Sony MDRXB60EX and a Shure SE215
The Shure SE215 has a great, balanced sound
It's among the best that I have had (under $150 budget)
Built quality is great, with detachable cable
It feels nice in the ear, but I didn't like the cord
It is thick and heavy
It's as thick as a USB cable for example
The cords weigh twice Sony's and three times the Bose and Klipsch ones
(Yes, I actually put them on a scale)
The sound isolation is better than the others
But it also suffers the common problem with all noise isolation phones
You hear your own body walking, especially when the cord touches you
Overall I think Sony XB60EX gives you the same level for lower money
My overall notes for sound quality (SQ) / Comfort (C) / Noise Isolation (NI) / "body" noise (BN)Bose IE2: SQ: 9

I like these headphones a lot
So much so, that I have now purchased two pairs of them (Lost the first pair in a move)
Great sound isolation, great comfort, great sound
I always tended to break the cord in my headphones, as I use them near-constantly
It always made me nervous about buying a more expensive pair
However, since these have a separate replacement cord that you can purchase, I decided to try these
I have to say, even with hard use, I have not had any issue with the cords being damaged
The construction of the cords seems to be high quality
I have one complaint, however
The left earphone occasionally has static/cuts out when I move my head certain directions
I have a really hard time isolating what causes it to happen, and I am not sure how to resolve the issue
I did not have this issue with my first pair
It isn't all the time, but it is just often enough to slightly annoy me, without making me deduct a star because of all of the other positives of these headphones
I love these inears
I got them for my inear monitor to use on stage at church and end up using them for everything from flying to listening to my ipod
I think I get a second pair for personal use and one for work
The sound quality is pretty good but the price is a little too high
There's a lot of high ends in the earphones and it lacks the low ends
But over all I'm satisfied
Amazing sound and great sound damping I would highly recommend them at this price point I find it hard to believe they can be beat
Very good sound quality
and they stay in my ears better than most everything else I've tried
Stout wires and good build quality
These are great for moise reduction and sound even better
I'm a singing drummer and am very pleased with this product
One side works, then doesn't work, then works, doesn't work
Been 3 months
Should have returned earlier
Actually, should have not bought them
Beware
Sound isolation good
Sound quality no better than $20 earphones
They were okay until they broke on me after 8 months
The sound started to cut out when I was walking after about 6 months
I contacted Shure
They couldn't fix them and opted to not replace them so they refunded me the money
Can't complain about the refund but for headphones of this quality and price, they should have lasted more than 8 months
The sound quality was pretty good
They did get a bit uncomfortable after wearing them for a while (my commute to work is about an hour and a half)
Also, I put these things in first thing in the morning after showering, so (gross) my ear wax got the buds dirty a lot
Now, I am a very hygenic person
I don't clean my ears every day (you're not supposed to) but I definitely do not let wax build up more than the average person and these got gross quick
So glad I switched to Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones
Well worth the additional $10
I had a pair of Klipsch S4's before these and thought I would try something else based on tech website reviews and although the sound quality is good, they are awful for working out
I don't run or jog or do anything too active just weight lifting and I'm constantly adjusting these
Switching out multiple tips don't seem to make a difference
I'll more than likely go back to the S4's or try something else
I use these for working out as well as general listening
- Great sound quality- VERY noise isolating, almost dangerous
Wore these in NYC subways where it's super noisy when trains are passing by and you don't hear much noise from the outside
These are not earbuds, these go inside your ears - big difference when it comes to noise isolation- Durable - wires seem thick and strong- Well reviewed on audiophile sites- When working out, they are worn looped around the ear so they don't move when you exercise or run
Seem sweatproof so far
I do not pretend to be an audiophile, but I have nothing but praise for their sound
I will let OC reviewers quibble over nuances of sound quality
I got these earphones mainly because of their reputation for good sound isolation
For me they excel at that
None of the included ear canal tips fit my ears properly, so I got some ribbed silicone ones from Sweetwater that did the trick
The tiny dots denoting the and left right earpieces are silly, so I painted on a larger ones
Once I got the knack of putting the earphones in place I became pleased with their sound
I have experienced no listening fatigue so I gather that they produce little distortion, another key feature for me
I am mildly annoyed with the geeky look of the clear model
I guess I expected that the wires would break and I wanted to be able to see them do it
But these wires are not going to break, ever
I should have gotten the black ones instead
Just really great earphones
Why pay more
When my Bose IE2 broke, I was in doubt of what earphones to buy for my daily walkings
I needed great sound, comfort, durability
So I've bought these: Klipsch S4, a Sony MDRXB60EX and a Shure SE215

It isn't all the time, but it is just often enough to slightly annoy me, without making me deduct a star because of all of the other positives of these headphones
I've worn these for 8 hours at a time on long flights
Good sound and comfortable
The ear pieces keep them in pretty well, even when you nod off
One thing, be sure to keep them clean so the sound pipe doesn't clog with ear wax
These sound great, and the buds stay in my ears because of the moldable wire that attaches to my ears even while running
I put them in and don't have to touch them once
It took a little getting used to at first, but after a week or so these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I have owned
They fit just right in your ear and don't randomly fall out
I loved these earphones, great noise cancelling and quality sound at a reasonable price
However, it seems that it was too good to be true, as just after 1
5 months of moderate use, the left earphone died
And it wasn't a cable issue as I switched the cable around and still had no sound coming from the left monitor
Quite a shame, as I'm sure it wasn't something on my part as I'm really careful around my electronics
Can't return as time's up for RMA
These earphones are great for casual music listening in loud places and especially while running on the treadmill
I think it's important to point out that these really are designed to be live sound in ear monitors
I'm an audio engineer and must say, these earphones are pretty recognizable for their purpose by their distinctly clear low midrange
They really are versatile though
I first started buying these type of earphones for music because they were the only thing that sounded great and stayed in my ear really well while running
I did own a pair of SE115s but lost them and they don't make those anymore, but these are actually a little better
They have perfect sized drivers so the bass is finally "normal"
Well as normal as these type of earphones will ever get
Cord noise while running is minimal and is hardly noticed after a few minutes
Great earphones, pick them up if you need something exceptional for active listening or live sound
I will begin this review by stating that I am by no means an audiophile nor am I a demanding consumer when it comes to audio equipment
I don't know all of the technical aspects of headphones and I rely greatly on what people are recommending v
me comprehending all of the technical specs of a product
When I was in the market for a pair of headphones I had a few wants:1)  I wanted an in ear anal ear bud form2)  I didn't want full on noise canceling headphones, but I wanted most of the outside noise to be controlled for3)  I didn't want to spend an arm and a leg4)  I wanted them to lastWhen I received these headphones I was pleased on all fronts with their performance
They sounded great and appeared to be everything I was looking for
However after about 7 months the left ear bud began to crackle and slowly fade in volume
Eventually the left ear bud stopped working altogether
This was extremely disappointing to me as I had enjoyed their performance to date
I ended up receiving another pair as a gift and the results were almost identical
The performance started out great, but until about 6 months into the use of them, the volume in the same left ear bud began to crackle and fade away until it eventually stopped working completely
I am not sure if I am just unlucky enough to get two bunk pairs or if perhaps I am just losing hearing in my left ear
Because of the performance (or lack thereof) this non technical audiophile would not recommend this particular pair
Awful build quality
They feel cheap, and both my headphones stopped playing any sound after less than two weeks of moderate use
Only used them sitting down at work, then coiled them up and put them in my pocket for a few weeks
Apparently that's too rough for these headphones to handle
Don't buy these if you want something that lasts
These are my first set of in-ear monitors
and all I can say is *wow*
I've never heard any of the more high end monitors, but these certainly are worth the price tag
I am pretty big on audio clarity and tone and these deliver in all aspects (highs/mids/lows) of rock/metal music
They also work great on-stage when plugged into a monitor system
Sound is great with these, with the caveat that if you are using a lower quality music player (such as many smartphones) these will also help you hear the deficiency of your music player
They do a great job with noise isolation, so you can work in a noisy cafe without being distracted
They also have about 2-3" of heavy-gauge wiring just next to the earbuds that stays in shape so you can bend the around your ear to keep them in place
Using them as Aviom monitors on-stage every week
Good isolation, full bass, clear highs, good mids
,
there is no comparison between these and regular earbuds
Once levels and stereo placement of other group sends were set on aviom, it was great to set my guitar feed in the middle and let it roll
Also, these are comfortable, Only negative I can list is it takes a little effort to get them in and pull them out
Definitely a great bargain alternative to custom IEM's costing, after ear molds from an audiologist, $500
00 to $800
00 or more depending on your wallet (and ego
:) )
Also great to passively listen to music with, just realize that normal conversation is not an option while wearing these
wife thought I was ignoring her
For passive listening, recording reproduction is very pleasing, if not "studio monitor" accurate
Very sweet sound
I entered a contest to win a couple of concert tickets and won these as a consolation prize
These were the best earphones I ever owned
The sound quality was superb and I could run in them without ever worrying about them falling off
They were comfortable enough for me to just put them on and forget about them
Unfortunately, I was being clumsy and careless with them and one of the buds broke beyond repair
When I came online to see about getting another pair I saw how expensive they were
These were more expensive than six of those tickets I was trying to win, so it was a heck of a prize while it lasted
I evaluated many in-the-ear options before settling on the Shure line
In fact I tried a few and each time, the cabling failed long before I thought it should
Shure solved the failed cabling issue by making the cables reliable and user replaceable
I've replaced the cable once in about 2 years
Once you install these correctly with the proper seals, they work great at sealing out the environment while remaining comfortable for hours of use
I am considering a second pair to replace another brand who's cabling has failed and is not replaceable
Recommended
I was concern about the fit of this headphones but they fit nicely , comfortable and have a great sound
I can easy recommend this unit
For the money the best I've had without having the triple driver ones
Not as good as the ultimate ear triple driver I had but for less than half the price they are close
I've had several sets of Shure ear buds
The sound is always good and the noise isolation is effective too
I am still pleased with the sound quality and noise isolation of these ear buds
The problem for me is the shape
They are kind of flat and nestle into the ear
However, particularly in my right ear, they bump up against a bone and become uncomfortable in about 1 hour
I'm sure they are fine for some people, but I wish Shure would return to the old ear bud shape
This is my second pair
The first set broke after a couple years but I sort of abused them
The sound on these things is absolutely amazing, coming from a life of $20-30 headphones
The foam buds are very comfortable and excellent at isolating sound, it ships with three rubber sizes and three foam sizes
I've tried Ultimate Ears 600, Sennheiser MM50, and Bose IE2 in-ear/earbuds and these Shure SE215-K headphones (Live Sound Monitor) are by far the best
The Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable, but they just rest in the cup of your ear where the foam tips on these do a much better job of blocking out external noise and transmitting sound
That means the quality of the music really shines through
I'd like to balance this review out with some more cons, but "the Bose earbuds are slightly more comfortable" is as close to a negative as you're going to find here
The first thing I noticed out of the box was how well-built the cord is
All the above products had issues with frayed cords in the span of about 9-12 months
I've only had these about two months so it's not a totally fair comparison yet, but I can't see them falling apart any time soon
The second thing I noticed was how fantastically awesome they sounded
I put on my Classical for Work Radio from Pandora and immediately heard details in the highs and the subtleties of play that I haven't heard in any headset since my beloved Bose triports
It's a bit of trial and error finding the right size tips to use for comfort and sound
Fortunately they include small, medium, and large tips in both rubber and foam
The rubber tips seem to have a softer feel than the foam, but they tend to make my ears sweat a bit more, so I stick with the foam tips
The foam tips do a wonderful job of regulating temperature for me
I wear these pretty much all day at work, to the gym, and on into my evening reddit/youtube browsing and I find the only time I have to take them out is to participate in conversation, never for discomfort
Don't be afraid to mix and match sizes--I found I get the best sound and comfort when I use a large on the left side and a medium on the right
Finally, the padded case provided in the package is fantastic
Mine came with a little carabiner which makes it a simple thing to clip on and carry with
It also has a tidy little inside pocket for carrying the extra tips and the included cleaning tool
All in all, if you're on the fence about purchasing these, I'd encourage you to just do it
I love these headphones
I had got these headphones about a month ago and these sound unlike anything I've ever heard
The review these have gotten are true to their word
I've owend many headphones throughout the years and I can honestly say theses are my best buys so far
I like the detachable cables so if the cable has a short just replace the cable and not the whole thing
One thing I would recommend is buy a set of triple flang ear tips as they make a perfect pair
These are great sounding in-ear monitors
The sound quality is outstanding
Figuring out how to put them on is not  easy
There are several "cushions" included for proper fit - trying a few to get the right comfort and sound is critical
One type [expandable] I tried felt good; but after wearing for an hour were VERY uncomfortable
switching to another type worked perfectly
I use these for listening to recorded music and also for live sound with a band - they work well for both
As you'd expect from Shure - these are high quality and well-built earphones
My previous monitors were Ultimate Ears that boasted of strong low end
they were good but not nearly as good as the Shure, The Shure monitors carry the whole spectrum without overly coloring the sound
I plan on using these for a long time
the foam ear piece is a big problem, frankly too much of an effort to wear
I'm sure it gets easier over time
Sound quality is awesome, ONLY IF IT FITS
Changing the foam ear pieces is quite difficult too
After 10 years of using the same in ear isolation monitors for drumming (M-Audio $150 comparable in ear monitors), they finally died
So, I bought the Shure SE215-K's, and I have to say that they isolate way better then the M-Audios
They are very bassy, almost too much, but if you roll off the bottom end a little, they sound great
4 stars (and not 5) because of the bass issue
Plus the flexible portion of the wire coming directly off the ear piece that you wrap around the top of your ear isn't quite long enough, they would be more comfortable if they were a little longer
And lastly, the little rubber sheath that you can move/cinch up on the L/R wires is very hard to move, almost to the point of risking causing damage to the wire fittings
The sound quality is great and the isolation is good too
Though I must say that I am not fond of earbud types, it is little bit uncomfortable for long time use
Those giant bose in their carrying case take up SO much room in your carry-on, don't they
Well these are your new airplane solution
The foam part that goes in your ear is made of earplug material, so you squish it and it does its part to block noise without being this huge thing on top of your ear
They pack up compact and are my new favorite traveler's secret
When I am playing music or podcasts on my phone with the normal white iphone style headphones (not even on an airplane
) I have to turn my volume all the way up
When I am listening to music on a noisy airplane with these headphones I have my volume one click above silent - that's how noise isolating these are
I love them
I know they're a little pricey but compared to the fancy bose they're a bargain
I'm a big fan of Shure products, and this pair of headphones is no exception
The sound fidelity is excellent, I'd say they probably sound better than any set I've ever had
I have a pair of over-ear Beats Pro (Detox) that I got as a gift, and in my opinion, though being half the price, these sound twice as good
The low range is great, bass is deep when you want it to be, and they get plenty loud with no distortion
I like foam earbuds, and the ones included fit very well and reduce environment sound by a lot
Standing on the subway platform, I sometimes get startled by trains approaching because I don't hear them coming until they pass me
I rely a lot on my headphones due to my NYC commute, taking buses and subways
It's very noisy
These headphones truly are great, and worth every penny
The only thing I'm not 100% fond of is the over-ear wire thing
It works great, and I get it, but sometimes I wish they were just regular earbuds because they can be difficult to put in at times
Not difficult, just a little weird
Once they're in, though, you have to physically take them out
They won't fall
I have had no issues with them to date
Been searching for years for comfortable great fitting small headphones that didn't compromise sound for size
These little buds have it all
Someone recommended the Bose and I found those too tinny, little bass and I'm not someone who likes a lot of bass
A twenty dollar pair of Sony's came with high recommendations and couldn't try those so I took the plunge
Would have done just as well to tear up a twenty dollar bill and flush in the crapper
They were the worse ever with maximum distortion and no bass at all
Shure has just enough of everything, well balanced, crisp and clear sound
I am most pleased and would highly recommend these to anyone
I bought these headphones to replace 8 year-old Shure E2c's, and I've now had them for about a year
Despite sounding amazing, I'm ultimately not able to use them as often as I'd like due to two major flaws
Without these flaws they would be 5 stars like my E2c's
With them they're only 3 stars
Here's a list of the pros and cons from my experience
Pros-As with the E2c's, the SE215's produce beautiful, balanced sound (if you're looking for unnatural bass look elsewhere)
-The silicone sleeves work just as well as the foam ones, but don't require that you hurriedly squish the foam and jam them in your ears in order to get a good fit
-They stay in place even when moving vigorously
-The cord is the perfect length for me
-The sound isolation is exceptional
Cons-The plug is very large (1cm diameter), and I have to take the bumper off of my phone in order to use these headphones
*The right headphone went dead at about 9 months which Sure replaced under warranty
The replacement process took 3 weeks
*The killer for me, though, is the deafening "booming" I hear whenever I take a step with these in
Going for a walk as I try to listen to a podcast is basically the podcast competing with the "BOOM-BOOM-BOOM" as my feet strike the ground, and that's with foam-soled running shoes on
To get an idea of what this is like, stick your fingers in your ears and go for a walk
It's nearly that bad
The bottom line: if you're looking for a set of headphones that you can wear at your desk, then these are great
Just don't exercise in them, and make sure you have a backup pair for when you need to have warranty work done
Excellent sound, comfortable and cool looking
Thanks, I was going to use it mainly to block noise while studying and it worked
I decided to upgrade to a more expensive product when my Apple headphones stopped working and I chose these
I wish that I could go back and just get Apple headphones again
These are not comfortable and the sound is not much better
Not great
I had got these headphones about a month ago and these sound unlike anything I've ever heard
The review these have gotten are true to their word
I've owend many headphones throughout the years and I can honestly say theses are my best buys so far
I like the detachable cables so if the cable has a short just replace the cable and not the whole thing
One thing I would recommend is buy a set of triple flang ear tips as they make a perfect pair
Bought these earphones to replace another set of Shures whose cables spontaneously shed the insulation, leaving 2 very thin wires exposed to each earphone
The new earphones have cables that are much thicker, and probably won't flake off like the first ones did
However, the insulation is so stiff that it's hard to position the earphone in your ear
Also any movement of your head can cause the earphones to shift in the ear canal, intermittently blocking the sound in that ear
Otherwise, the sound is good if you can keep the earphones in place
Absolutely fantastic
Best in-ear headphones I have ever come across-- great detail in the whole range of frequencies
Fits comfortably and, most importantly, the isolation is superb
This set has better isolation than most studio monitoring headsets I've tried
Love the sound
I've had several versions of these headphones over many years, having bought each subsequent model as they've updated the design
This one delivers as expected in many ways - most notably the audio, which is probably the most important aspect
There are a couple of disappointments, however
One flaw is that they are just not very easy to get around the ears and into the ear canal
They have a stiff sheath along the few inches of cord nearest to the buds which does not mold easily to the shape of the ear
I understand what they were trying to do - presumably they wanted to give that section some sturdiness so that the cord would mold nicely and stay in place - but the execution produced the opposite of the desired effect, actually making it harder to get the cord to hook around the ear and stay put
Moreover, because of the substantial plastic casing around the electronics, the buds don't fit in my ears very squarely, and the positioning is easily disrupted by any contact
Any pressure on the bulky outside of the buds - such as from a pillow or even a headband when it's cold - can cause the fit to be distorted, the foam to collapse, and the sound to be muted
Not ideal
I'll continue to use these headphones and I'm not in a hurry to replace them, but they are not as well-designed as previous Shure models, and when it is time to buy again, I will research other options
Great earphones which I use constantly
Sound quality is definitely amazing
I suggest when you try to get those factory buds off, work from the bottom
You must get a very good grip and when you try to pull them off try to twist a bit as well
For some reason that tricked worked for me and I'm a guy so I don't have cool fingernails like the ladies
Other than that they work perfectly, look great, and just take some time getting used to(weird shape)
Also, another tip for when you put them on
If you want to be really snug in your ear, take your hand opposite to the earbud your going to put on and lift the tip of your ear while you place the ear-bud in
This trick worked like a charm for me so I'm just sharing some random tips
Well, I highly recommend these earphones
Their very popular among artist and you can't beat the quality
Enjoy everyone, I'm "shure" you will
I was disappointed for a while that this product wasn't available on Amazon Global but recently a friend came back from the US so I asked him to bring it back for me
I must say it was worth the wait
These earphones are really solidly built - the cables are thick, heavy and long enough for the rowing machine (putting the phone on the floor)
The sound is rich and natural sounding
I use them over a mix of audiobooks, pop, rock, hip hop - it handles everything well
Of course, the sound would assumably be even better with the higher end Shures but you'd have to pay several multiples of this (you can see from all my reviews that I have a strong value bias)
For this price, I'd say this beats the Ultimate Ears 600s and are now the ones I like to reach for to enjoy my music
I think one thing that really helps are the foam tips - it forms a very good seal, making the music even more immersive
I wonder why not more manufacturers ship their earphones with foam tips
I like the sound quality very much, but I used them for running and sweat corroded the wire connectors by the ears
Let me start out by saying that the Shure SE215 saved me
I've been having a lot of problems with my recordings and finding the right monitor balance because my headsets just don't block out enough noise and my other pair of earbuds don't stay in
These earbuds block out a lot more noise than I expected, the lows/highs balance is perfect, and you can't yank these out
Once they're in, they're in
I highly recommend these
My one and only problem with these is changing out the sleeves
I haven't take off the medium black foam sleeves that came already on these things because I was afraid of breaking them
It seems that if I go to change them, they won't come off
I really don't want to break these and put 100 dollars down the drain
I'm happy with the sleeves that are on there now but if I ever need to change them, it may be a problem
I would appreciate comments on the best way to remove the sleeves without breaking the earbuds
Thanks
These headphones provide fantastic isolation, and very directed sound
When I take them out, even if they're blasting, you can barely hear the music coming out of them
Well, in my office
YMMV, of course
Firstly this pair of earphones are rather comfortable
They fit very nicely flush into your ears so using them while lying down on your sides is not a problem (something that I do quite often)
This is compared to the UE triple-fi 10 which really sticks out and makes you look really weird too
Sound quality wise they are pretty much one of the best in this price range
They are not flat or neutral sounding, the sound is slightly coloured, more towards the bass side of things but I feel that that makes it a good pair of casual earphones as flat sounding earphones tend to get fatiguing to use after awhile
So if you're not an audio professional and just using this for your daily commute it does a fine job
However if you're the running with music person this is not the pair of earphones you want to wear while exercising
Even though the removable cables make it easier to change cables that have worn out, the connectors between the cables and the earphones are another point of failure that has been introduced
Sweat can get in easily to wreak havoc with your earphones and I have a pair that suffered a loose connection but Shure's warranty took care of that nicely
The cable's 3
5mm jack is also L-shaped and kind of large so if you happen to use it with your phone that has a case with a tight opening for the audio jack it might not be able to fit
Despite some shortcomings I still believe that for this price this are the earphones to get
In fact I've gotten an additional 2 pairs as gifts for friends and the feedback has been very positive
I had been using the previous version of these with the short cord and a Shure microphone extension for about three years
Unfortunately, the right earpiece stopped working, so I ordered this one with the replacement microphone and controller for iPhones
The design whereby the cord attaches directly to the earpiece should mean that one will not need to throw away the entire headset when a wire frays
It uses the same replacement inserts as the previous one (good, since I still have a dozen of them), and inserts in the ear the same way, except that it lies flatter
For me, the medium insert cuts out some ambient sound, but I can still hear enough that it is safe to use while walking outside
The sound quality is more than adequate for mp3's and internet streaming (the only things for which I have used them)
I use them on BART and they are perfect for my commute
I can still hear some outside noises, which is okay, but the sound quality is better than any headphones I have ever had
These earbuds are well-priced, have nice sound insulation options, and most importantly provide excellent sound
The bass response is a bit more accentuated than some may like, but it can easily be EQed down, and it isn't boomy or sloppy
Best headphone I have ever owned
Highest quality sound for under $100
No other manufactures come close to Shure
I couldn't ask for more for this product
I love it so much
The sound quality is the best for its line
However, for the first time user you will find it's hard to put in your ear due to its unique model
I love it especially for studying
The voice isolation works really well
I do not bother to write too many reviews, but this product is outstanding
I am an audiophile and enjoy great sound with headphones, speakers and an awesome JL stereo in my car
I am not an expert in earphones
I have purchased many earphones, especially for my 16 hour flights to Seoul, I am amazed at these Sure Earphones, they are amazing
I hear details I have heard in no other format
I do not know how they compare to other brands at this price, but I can tell you they are worth every penny
I am going to save up for some of the higher end Shure earphones just to see what else I am missing
Love the sounds produced by the SE215
Very well balanced and the Bass is not too heavy but still packs a punch
I would say it is one of the best earphones in the under $100 group
Only thing to consider is the unusually long cables that comes with the SE215
I aint very tall so when im using the SE215 with my phone, the excess cables can be a hassle
But if you dont have a problem with cable length, i highly recommend getting the Shure SE215
I love the way these headphones fit
I can bike, run with no problems
Also these headphones perfect for subway commute as they block all noise
I would not recommend using them while biking in the city or any area that you may need to listen out for your surroundings
Bass quality is great on trance and rap tracks; however, it can be distorted when I listed to Rammstein
After my old Shure buds bit the dust (the cord cracked and there was exposed wire), I tried buying 2 different buds
The Klipsch and Beats
Neither came close in highs and lows
The noise isolation is great, which is important to me
I want to hear the music, not background noise
I highly recommend Shure buds
I've had all kinds of headphones, from the etimotic, to Ultimate Ears, and these are awesome at a great prices
Bass is great
I regret so much for buying these headphones
Now I have to re-download all my music in FLAC because these headphones give so much detail that they make my 320 bit songs sound like crap
I really like these
Really solid seal for isolation - you won't hear anything around you
I use them when flying and usually can't hear anything around me including the overhead announcements
My only complaint would be that the foam pieces are extremely difficult to get off
I haven't been able to remove mine to try a different size
everything attempt I've had, I have felt like I was going to break them
Other than that, very good sound quality and overall great product
Awesome equipment
Shure comes thru again
These are the only earphones that I've tried (and I've tried plenty) that provide the comfort, fit and sound quality that an earphone should have
These earphones are great (really good sound and isolation), but they weren't made to last, that's for sure
Mine came with a minor problem, that I noticed the first time I put it on (right earphone was failing)
As I live in Brazil, I had to live with the problem since a RMA would take a huge time
Now exactly 4 months since I bought it, the right side is completely dead
No sound at all
Too bad for a product that costs US$ 99,00
Next time I will stay with Bose (the ones I had before SE215-K, unfortunately I lost them on a plane)
Now all I can do is wait a hell of a time for the RMA
True story folks, think twice before buying
This is the 2nd pair of these headphones I have gotten
I had to return the 1st pair because the one ear phone was going in and out
I got the 2nd pair and after a few months the one ear phone is completely dead
Very disappointing to only be able to get a few months of usage considering these headphones are pretty expensive
Really good quality, sounds amazing, if you use with Fiio E6 or E12 sounds incredible clear and decent quality
Buy one you can't go wrongOnly part which may other new buyers needs to watch out is how the ear pears sits inside your ear some May found
really uncomfortable, but works excellent for me
Over all I will give 9/10 for this product
If your an audiophile, this is the best headphone in its price range
The clarity is incredible
The details are definable from its 22
5Hz to 17
5kHz
I am a musician and I wear these daily in the moments of when I'm in transit
If I could change one thing, I do wish it had a highs extending to 20kHz, but nonetheless, totally satisfied with these
First off, these earphones are great sounding
Good bass and a very accurate reproduction of the music that I listen to when I drum
The only reason for three stars is that the sound isolating ear tips don't stay in my ears when I'm drumming
I've tried different sizes and different combinations of ear tips, but haven't really been able to remedy the situation
They're a bit clumsy to put into my ears and for whatever reason the right earphone consistently falls out
If you use these to simply listen to music, they'll be fantastic
For drum-along, they didn't work for me very well
For my application I could give these a 4+ but the lows aren't really there so overall, they're a 3
I use them for vocals only and the band has to "pass thru" since they aren't in the monitor mix
The result- I can here the band and my drums clearly although the volume is lower and and I can control how much vocal I get in my ears
As a plus, I'm able to lower the overall volume to my ears
If the band were in the monitor mix, I think I would want something with a little more low end response, but for this very specialized application, they are perfect, especially at this price point
Few notable things:1
One pet peeve of mine is cheap headphones where everyone around you has to listen to what you're playing on your headphones
These Shure's don't have that problem
It has to be ridiculously loud for a person sitting right next to me to even hear a hint of sound
(even in a quiet room)2
They are not very intuitive in how to place in your ears -- know that there is a semi hard wire that loops over the ear and the earbud swivels into place or just read the directions
3
These are a lot like wearing earplugs and like earplugs it will pull every little bit of earwax out with them
So, keep your ears clean and it's probably a good idea to have some alcohol wipes to clean them up after use
Great sound quality when working correctly
The problem is that if you use these working out they need constant cleaning
Never really got a true fit out of these and they lasted 18 months before one of the ears stopped working
The ability to change cables seems to create additional problems
I bought them for $100 and thought I would get more out of them
They are not water resistent in the least bit
Overall I would rate these as fair
I refuse to pay more then $100 for any earbuds since the mark up on these product is so significant
Exceeded my expectations and more comfortable than my other sets of in ear headphones
Deep but realistic sound
Be sure to follow instructions on wearing earphones carefully
i use these in ear monitors mostly while riding my motorcycle and they replaced my SE210's which bit the dust
Overall I have to say I liked the SE210's better, but of course they are discontinued so I thought I would try their replacement the SE 215 which were acutally a lttle cheaper
The SE210's were a bit more comfortable and I believe had slightly better sound
The SE215's have a more robust cord which was a negative on the 210's
The cord is also easily detachable in case it breaks, but is a one piece design instead of the two piece design of the 210's  I liked that I could unplug the cord of the 210's in the middle of the cord instead of at the device input
Gave more felexibility for using
As for the sound, they sound very good, but like i said, I thought their predessesor had better sound quality and were a little more comfortable
Overall I give it 4 stars out of 5
For a while I had the Klipsch S4 earbuds, and I was perfectly content until the left ear gave out
I debated whether I should 'upgrade' or pick up a new pair of S4s
In the end, I decided to go with these Shure SE215s, and they do not disappoint
I was skeptical if I would notice a difference from the S4s, especially given their high ratings
I'm glad to report, there certainly is a difference
The high notes are crisp and the lows are perfectly balanced, with a hearty bass
Best of all, I'm noticing nuances in the music that I have not heard before
These are a great pair of in-ear monitors, I highly recommend
With the first time that I put these earbuds on and turned on the Ipod, I was hooked
I have also used them as stage monitors in a band
No complaints, well worth the price
Great sound and perfect for travel
They're small so they pack away nice and block out surrounding sound especially when you put music through them
Skip the microphone option
it's really hard to use these as phone headsets because you can't hear yourself speak and/or know how loud you're talking
I would recommend for music lovers and people that spend a lot of time in the air
Most days, these are in my ears more than not
They have great sound and I find them very comfortable
When I lost my first pair I didn't even consider shopping around for a different model
I've owned these for about a month now
I use them daily at work, and I have to say, I LOVE them
The sound quality is amazing
Like others have said, I hear things in my music now that I did not before
Of course, I was coming from the cheap Samsung ear buds that game with my Galaxy S III, but I don't think this invalidates my point
As far as fit, once you get the hang of putting them in (there is a learning curve if you're coming from standard buds), you can pop them in and out with no problem and when they're in, they're IN
They don't move around at all and the rigid part of the cord helps as it serves as an ear hook of sorts
I do have to agree with the previous reviewer on my ears getting tired out
Because these block out a lot of ambient noise (they might as well be noise-cancelling - people have had "conversations" with me that I have not heard while listening through these), your ears do get tired out after a while
I LOVE music and I LOVE listening to it for hours on end; but I definitely do feel some level of relief when I pull them out of my ears after long listening sessions
They have been great for my needs though - they block out most, if not all of the noise around me (namely, my co-workers' conversations) so that I can focus on my work
I'm also a musician, and I'm hoping to get to try these out in a live sound application at some point; I just haven't played anywhere that has an in-ear monitor system
So here's the breakdown:PROS:Clear, balanced soundBuild QualityNice zippered case with a big "Shure" label so people know you mean business when it comes to your music listening
CONS:Learning curve with learning how to put them in (It's a short one)
Tired ears after extended use
I'd ABSOLUTELY buy these again, but I guess time will tell how they hold up
I see lots of reviews calling these headphones or something similar
People saying how they don't work while jogging and such
Evidently these folks don't understand the purpose of these buds
These are made by Shure
In case you're not familiar, this company makes musical equipment like studio headphones and microphones
They produce the industry standard dynamic mic, the SM58
As a professional musician I own many of their products from microphones to these earbuds
These are intended to be used as personal monitors onstage
They work with a wireless system so a musician can hear his/her voice and instrument in their ears while performing
They are not meant to be used while jogging, driving, working, etc
Shure is known throughout the world for reliability of their products
I have seen the SM58 run over by a bus and still function flawlessly (I have pictures
)
These buds perform well if used as intended
They will take a measure of abuse but anything will fail if misused
It's not the fault of the product but the user
Just setting the record straight
These sound great
I don't have golden ears, but I believe I can at least partly tell the difference between good and bad headphones/earbud
I loved my last pair, sony buds that I only replaced because the cord finally gave in after probably 6 or 7 years
The complaints about putting these in are founded, but honestly, if you spend a little time practising, it's not complicated and you can find easier ways
Sometimes I'll put the cord over the ear first, then fold the bud into the canal
Other time, the opposite
I tug on my lobe with the thumb and ring finger and use my index finger to apply pressure on the body of the plug to seat it in my canal
I do run with these in
They block a lot of sound, but not everything
I' pretty hyper vigilant about my surrounding when I'm running, so I'm usually very aware anyway
I wear them to listen to music while working in the workshop and it turned the quite loud combination of my radial arm saw + shop vac into an EXTREMELY manageable background sound, and I could still hear my son yell at me to shut it off when he wanted to ride his bike in the garage - all without taking away too much from the music
In less than perfect settings, like resting my head against a pillow (or car seat) they do start to hurt a bit after about an hour
General wear, however, hasn't really had that effect
The cord doesn't tangle remotely as much as my previous pair, but I hope to keep up the habit of winding them and putting them in the pouch that comes with them
I got the "black", but they are transparent black
I'd rather opaque, but really, it's not a big deal
I do sometimes wish the distance between the "Y" where the L/R cords connect was a little longer, again, it's not bothered me enough to dock points, really
I'd actually give a 4
5/5 but don't feel the need to take away an entire star
(Update)7 months it made it without a hitch
Then the right side started to flake on me
I have to contort the wire and get lucky to get sound, which usually stays fine until I remove them and have to do it again the nest time I use them
I'll be returning to Shure for a replacement, but I have to say that my previous Sony pair, with near daily use, lasted 6-7 YEARS without issue, so this bothers me
I'm certain Shure will replace at least the cable, otherwise I'd be dropping more than the one star I took off
I'll update if I have other issues with the replacement process or otherwise
Maybe I'm slow since most people gave these headphones a favorable review but I think these headphones are awful
They're uncomfortable and the sound quality isn't that good
Maybe I didn't get it in right because they did easily come out but headphones shouldn't take more than 15min to put in
My ears were literally hurting from messing with these to fit in my ear
I tried different sized ear pieces as well since usually the small size is the one that fits best
I've tried numerous mid/high quality headphones right around this price and up and I can say with confidence that for $99 these are definitely not worth it
The headphones are great for noise isolation
I use them while on the bus and they allow me to listen to my music at a low volume and not needing to have it at full blast to listen like with other headphones
Also they don't make any cable noise for when working out
The only thing to watch out for is that they may be way too isolating to the point where I miss conversations behind my back or people trying to get my attention
Overall I reall recommend this product for anyone looking for a great pair of headphones
One small thing to watch out for is the strange way to put them in place on your ears since it is a bit ackward at first
I use these for drums and every day listening
They work great
I would be interested in seeing a frequency graph for these, because the range and decibel limit accross all frequencies is really high
These ARE studio monitoring headphones, after all
Anyone who says that these "have enough bass but not too much" isn't using a good MP3 player, because I am using the Poweramp app on my phone and the bass will go go as high as you want
Enough to shake your eardrums and give you an instant headache, with zero distortion
I turned it up just to test it, and didn't last long
The high power mid range compliments the thunderous bass
High end is crystal clear
They are also durable
10/10, would buy again, and recommend
Note: I experienced distortion while using my 5 year old iPod Classic but absolutely none while using my phone
Honestly worth every penny, sound canceling is amazing, the in ear security is flawless and the part of that is the most susceptible to damage(the cord) is replaceable
These travel everywhere with me
On a motorcycle between cities they are the best, and no rain has ever been able to cause a problem
I will never buy another brand of headphones
These are amazing
I use them daily at work to block out distracting noise
The noise cancelling ability of these headphones make it possible to play music at low volume and not hear people talking in the next cube
These were recommended by a friend as I was looking for earbuds that would reduce noise while I was outside
This product acts like an earplug with soft, form fitting cushions on the inner ear piece
There were several different sizes included with the package
I had to change from the medium size down to the small size, and removal the ear cushion was a bit difficult as it was very snug on the earbud
Once I had the earbud seated properly in my ear, then the sound just blossomed
It may take a few tries to find the most comfortable fit for you, but it really does help reduce outside noise and gives you great sound for your podcasts and music
NOTE: Some persons have recommended the EATFL1-6 Triple Flange Sleeves for SE model earphones product, since many persons have difficulty using the original inner ear cushion on the earbuds
See my review on my Shure EATFL1 earbud sleeves
These replace my good long time use earbuds and I am just as happy as I was with those pro units
Relativrly inexpensive and top quality sound
As a rock musician and a drummer these are everything I need to hear the bassist and the chimes and everything in between
Used with the sleeves they fit so much better and stay in place, however they remove easily
Through a couple of Apple iPhones, a Samsung Android phone, an iPad and Nexus 7 tablet I've kept searching for the perfect in-ear monitors with an integrated microphone
The earbuds shipped with the devices fell out of my ears in seconds
And the inexpensive replacements I tried sounded so bad I dropped them in the garbage
I finally got a pair of V-Moda's to fit and sound decent
But the microphone was just okay for phone calls
Then, after a while, one side started losing low end
A couple of weeks later the volume of that side was about half of the good side
I tried the Bowers & Wilkins C5's and they sounded pretty good but they never were comfortable for an extended time
The worst thing was they kept turning the volume down on my Android phone at random times
Every now and then some head movement would trigger the mute button
I couldn't just relax and enjoy the music
Then I realized that I'd made a classic mistake
I'd tried to get a tool to do more than one job well and was disappointed when it did not happen
I'm a media producer with over 35 years experience in audio and video production
I use headphones and in-ear systems for monitoring audio during video production, checking mixes in post-production, monitoring audio during online calls, and listening for pleasure on weekends
I dropped the idea of using my in-ear monitors for anything other than listening
I kept reading about the Shure SE215's and decided to give them a try
Out of the box they had a pleasing, balanced sound
In fact, they sounded better brand new than some units I'd burned in for hours
And they not only fit my ears, they stayed where I put them
They become almost invisible after a couple of minutes
I'm talking about the audio field disappearing as well as the physical fit
The music just happens and it's so silky smooth it makes me smile
Yes, you will need to try different sleeves to find what fits you
And the sleeves are difficult to remove at first
Yes, you might want to find a youtube video showing you how to put them on correctly
It makes a huge difference when they are seated properly with the cables over your ears
Yes, they block almost all the sound in the room
That's what they are designed to do
That's why musicians on stage like to wear them
I need that, too, when I use them in a production environment
Just make sure you get the left and right monitors in the correct ears
I switched them once by accident and couldn't believe how much difference it made when I had them on the correct sides
If you're like me and want a pair of comfortable, affordable, accurate in-ear monitors that just sound great then I highly recommend the SE215's
I paid $99 for them here on Amazon and they are one of the best audio purchases I've made in a long time
I had these headphones for about 2 months before i broke them on accident (it was my fault not the headphones) but while i had the sound for rock,jazz,classical and country were good but for electronic songs like skrillex,tiesto,etc they sounded really bad, i wouldn't recommend this if you want to listen to electronic songs or rap
My experience with Shure SE215-K and the Bose IE2I have owned the Bose IE2 earphones for over 2 years and had them replaced twice
The bose earphones are okay but after 6+ months they start to wear very fast
The wire had wear and tear 8 months in from purchase date (authorized dealer) and I had to have them warrantied
I still own them but decided to buy new earphones because the quality on the earphones started to die out and then wire got really bad again
This time I was out of luck cause the warranty period ended 9 months ago
I used the Bose IE2 daily and it served its purpose
Back then, I was suckered in by Bose advertising and got their product
After looking at many online reviews, I started to wonder if Bose really lived up to their name and quality
So that's when I started to look at new earphones to buy and landed me here
Please note warranty periods: Bose - 1 Year VS Shure SE215 - 2 Year
To have a valid warranty make sure you buy directly from Amazon
com LLC
If not, you risk buying a non-authorized one without warranty
After reading many reviews and thinking about the price ($100), I have decided to go with these(Shure SE215-K)
When I received the product, I was happy to un-box them and compare them to my Bose IE2 earphones
At first, it took some getting used putting them in my ear but I figured it out within 5 minutes
I plugged them into my phone ( Samsung Galaxy S4 ) and started to test out multiple songs
Surprisingly the bass was a lot better than Bose and WAY MORE sound isolation
I had another person compare them and they came up with the same conclusion
They are not super earphones like the 400$+ ones but they do get the job done if your looking for decent earphones
The only DOWNSIDE to this product, in my opinion, is the shape of the wire around the ear
If the wire was just straight down like other brands, I would absolutely love it
This may be one factor to which you may not like the product so please consider that before buying
I am still getting used to the shape around the ear but I believe over time I will conform to it
Also a huge plus to this product is the detachable wire
If you ever rip the wire due to accident or any other reason, you can just buy another wire on Amazon near $20-$30
So after your warranty period ends and an accident happens, you can be sure to stay in the okay
Unlike Bose IE2, which are totally useless now due to my wire accident
The plastic around the jack is too fat for use with a Nexus 4 that has a bumper on it
I'm really disappointed about that because I loved my Shure SE110 headset, and I was looking forward to this replacement
I'm returning these because they are useless with my current phone
Loved my last pair of Shures so much, I decided  on another pair after trying other less expensive options
None of them do such a good job of noise isolation as the Shures,  period
And the sound quality is very nicely balanced, not too bright,  not too boomy,  just right
And the replaceable cables make these the very best value hands down
No buyers remorse here
Bought these to use with my church's sound system on stage
Great sound, much better than my previous pair of in ear monitors at the same price point
It takes getting used to before you can throw them in your ear quickly
Effective on the airplane
I also like the sound quality of these SE215-CL, but after I wear them for a long time my ears begin to hurt
Additionally the way the ergonomics work on these headphones the wire has to wrap around your ear
I find that it never really stays fully in place, especially if your the type that has an active lifestyle
I find myself constantly fidgeting around with the wire to get it in the right place
I spent a solid 15 minutes trying to figure out how to even wear these things, and when I finally were able to get them in, they were very uncomfortable
After that, I plugged them into my iPod and there was just static sound unless I held the cord in a certain way
The package did not come with a receipt or an adhesive return label, causing an even more inconvenience
40hz to 1 Khz, Flat
20hz: - 4db
2Khz: + 2db
3Khz: + 10db
6Khz:  + 6db
7Khz:  - 4db
8 KHz: - 10 db
10 KHz:- 20db
This response pretty much agrees with what one hears - excellent lows with midrange boosted but rolled off high end
To all the drummers
If you're looking for an inexpensive way to have in ear monitors for purposes of playing to a click (and also for vocal monitoring purposes) these buds are great
When inserted correctly, Isolation is comparable to the roll up foam 32db ear plugs I have been using live for many years to protect my hearing in a VERY LOUD stage volume band
These buds have excellent isolation and make playing to a click live very easy
Tried 2 pairs in less then a week (prime)first pair  wire at can failed cut in and out
second pair after an hour of use left side got very scratchie heavy bass now I have 2 boxes to return
Shure SE215  PHOOEY
I am speechless
If you want to listen to the music you must buy one, and if you just want to hear the music don't buy them, seriously, you will just complain about something not right
I am glad to spend $100 for a QUALITY
Absolutely Love them
These are not very naturally fitting headphones, having to adjust the earpiece each time you put them on, and multiple times for active wear like gym sessions
After ~2 months of normal use, the right side earpiece intermittently stopped working, then a week later broke altogether
I am very happy with these
My SCL2 series cord actually cracked and I sent them in to get serviced
Long story short, I received these pairs from Shure
I am so happy with these
The buds that come with these are much better than the ones with the SCL2
I am using the expanding foam ones
The first time I used them, they expanded and blocked out the noise
What this meant was much better Bass and clarity
I am a drummer, so using these was incredible
The sound is really clear
As I drum, I hear minimal sounds from the kit and more from the monitors
I recommend these for musicians
One reviewer said that it was a bad thing that they isolated the sound around you
That means they are doing their job
If you want earphones that bleed the outside noise, then, buy cheaper models, or use the buds that don't use the expansion foam
I would've given these 5 stars, but the only thing I am skeptical with is that the cord close to the ear buds are very stiff and you have to bend them to conform around your ear and back of your head
I just think that eventually, these too will begin to crack, but we'll see
Maybe that is why they designed them to bend is so that it protects it from cracking
But, that will be determined in the future
I recommend these monitors for musicians and as a drummer, I can tell you, these work very, very well
Recording or live performances
I use them in both scenarios and they work incredible
Love the sounds of these headphones
The only complaint I have is if the plug twists in the jack slightly there is a brief sound disconnect
I've observed this on some other higher-quality headphones/earphones, so maybe it's to be expected
I've had these for 6 monthsvery durable - detachable cable is great, have not needed to replace yet thoughgreat sound quality and very good sound isolation
I'm sticking with Shure
I am traveling around the country a lot
I use these for music or when I am watching a movie on my tablet
The sound is excellent
The base is very nice without being overpowering
I used to use the very popular over the ear noise cancelling head phones, but set them on the shelf years ago
These are easy to carry
I don't need an extra carrying case to bring on a plane
They fit fine in my pocket or laptop bag
I don't feel like I am loosing anything on sound
The sound isolating part was great, the sound was pretty clear too
However they got dirty and the left earbud stopped working after light usage
I am very disappointed
shure has the sound i like
replaces a  broken set and the sound still impresses
worth looking into imho that is
The quality is great and the fit and the form is very good, i like these audios because the sounds is really good
Love everything about these buds
Yes, they may take a little bit of time to find what size fits your ear
But once you do
beautiful sound
Used to use Klipsch S4 and S4i, but they had durability issues (my only real qualm with them actually)
But these buds step up the sound quality (just a tad, but it's noticeable, especially in highs and the overall body of the sound is just deeper and more pronounced)
The Shure's come in with a bit more weight, but feel much more sturdy
Good $100 replacement, very happy I moved from my Klipsch
I've used like Shure products for the last 10 years or so
I like to mainly use these while working out because of the way they are worn (loop over back of the ear) as they prevent then from pulling out if the cord is yanked
These are pretty good although I like the older ones (fit) better for some reason
The cord is very long - a bit too long in my opinion as it sometimes gets in the way
Good sound for shure
:) Good seal too
I used to have the Shure e2c
these are much better sounding for the same price, and seem more durable
Sound isolation is superb
(so don't use these while jogging)I had the klipsch s4, which were pure garbage in every way (reliability, sound) compared to the se215
Shure has gotten it right
If you have $99 in your budget for in-ears, get these, you won't regret it
contains really good sound
It display the music as I hear it in the concert
Love it~ Thank you~
Pros:- Great fit- Terrific sound- Nice clarity- Extremely effective noise cancellationCons:- Somewhat inconvenient to put on & take off- Sound isn't as balanced as I'd like, leans towards bass- Extremely effective noise cancellation
I bought these because I read reviews that outside noise was minimized and the design held the ear plugs in place
While the noise was reduced significantly, I did not find it as "noise cancelling" as some reviewers
However, it was sufficient enough that I was very satisfied with the results
Comfort was also good once you get the hang of plugging the buds and wrapping the wires
Highly recommended
This item fits in my ear very well and cuts out a lot of the heavy engine noise that surrounds me
The Shure SE215-K Monitors work great at blocking out ambient sound letting the true sound of the music play
This was so expensive that when I opened it I was shocked to see just how terribly it was built
The cord is stiff and unwieldy, yet tangles quite often
The earpiece options are all hard to put into your ear
On top of that, the way this earphone was built makes it so you HAVE to put the stiff unwieldy wires over the top of your ear before you can even put it on
I would recommend this product to absolutely no one because frankly, I can't imagine how anyone would like something so terrible yet so expensive
Its only saving grace is that the sound is at least decent amid all the terrible construction
Clear, powerful sound and near total isolation from the world around you
These are by far the best in-ears I've ever purchased
I like Shure headphones this is my second pair, my first lasted about 3 years
I really like the sound (I am not an audiophile) of the head phones, nothing is over powering
I will say though that after while, they get very uncomfortable for me
I was on a flight from LA to Sydney and about 6 hours in, they were pretty painful in my ears
I am keeping them but have ordered another set of earphones from Amazon to try for my next long flight
Really good sound and Shure have redesigned these so they don't break where they used to on the wire
Used with the handsfree kit, they are perfect for music and also any hand free calls etc
The sound isolation is amazing and really comfortable,
These earphones are amazing in terms of noise cancellation and sound quality (compared to cheaper $20 sets)
Definitely worth it if that's what you're looking for
They come with 6 different tips and a little bag to carry them in, which I didn't know about until I bought them
There is one problem that prevents it from getting 5 stars though, which is that its difficult to put them in and take them out using the default over-ear set up
I love these earphones but for my next pair I'll just get some of the classic styled ones
I fell in love with Shure SE-Series over 4 years ago
When I purchased my first pair of Shure SE-115's, great design: the wires were not too long and there was a nice "break away jack", so one could switch between sound systems
Very cool,simple, and durable
The new SE215-CL's are designed so that the stem insert part that goes into my ear canal, is not offset enough from the speaker
The bulk of the speaker causes an insecure seal with the foam (thats on the stem), causing the device to fall out of my ear
If the stem were longer, that would create better distance between the speaker and stem insert, so the foam could then sit and expand in my ear canal
A minor issue for me is the look of the newShure SE215-CL Sound Isolating Earphones SE215-CL, they remind me of hearing aids
I'm a lover of simplicity and function, and I'll be the first one to buy the "old" style again, if Shure ever decides to bring back the SE115's
I'm going to try and give a non audiophile review of these
If you want an audiophile review, read some of the other top reviews and save yourself some time and stop reading this now
So, seriously, Shure should market these as ear plugs with free headphones
Their ability to block sound is absolutely amazing
To the extent that these headphones should be standard issue for any frequent flyer
No longer do you need to lug around sound canceling cans when you have these lil guys in your briefcase
Crying babies, clapping, chatty kathy sitting next to you -- Gone
I mean, these guys completely isolate you from the outside audible would
Beyond blocking outside sound, the headphone quality is pretty good
Within the price range of these guys there are probably a few choices with slightly better sound quality
But as far as sound quality is concerned, these headphones really seem to error on the side of being a better Rock/Pop head phone than Classic Piano or Hard core rap
The highs are pretty sharp -- and the lows won't rattle your fillings
But what really makes these shine is the lack of outside noise pollution and how well they place you in the middle of the music you're listening too
These are probably the closest you can get to cans without buying cans
Install Tip 1: It is awkward putting them in the first few times
Really, and sorry for being crude, the easiest way it follow the same rules you would for putting on a condom
Pinch the tip, then hold it in place while using the other hand to roll the wire around your ear
Install Tip 2: These are not labeled 'R' and 'L'
Instead they have red and blue dots on them
Just remember "Red is Right" and it'll save you some headaches
They're Spinning
: Also, they spin freely, and can end up backwards
Putting them in backwards doesn't end well
iPhone: If you plan on using these on an iPhone w/ a case, the plug is a bit thick, It works fine with my bumper, but would need to be modified to fit into my wifes Otter case
Finally, I DO NOT recommend these for people who plan on wearing them in an urban environment
Simply, you will get hit by a bus
I cannot stress how little of the outside world you can hear when these are inserted
If you are looking for a head phone to wear on your bike, on you walk to work, or anything else that involves being around large high speed metal boxes -- for your own safety -- don't buy these
Everyone else, it's hard to go wrong with these
I Highly recommend them
Okay - nothing is meant to last forever
but these earphones are top notch
Recently my old Shure SE headphones broke
The cable near the headphone cracked due to being dried out
I had them for 7 years and listened to them twice a week, while on a plane and used them in the gym
They cancel out the noise w/out using sound
I tried changing to Klipsch and Etymotic, but didn't like the cords
When I moved, they were extremely loud
I reverted back to Shure and I am glad I did
Shure's repair policy and customer service is garbage, they wanted $90 to repair my old ones, and for a few bucks more I could just buy new
but they last a long time and a have great sound
Food for thought
I am one of those people who buy a ton of earphones
I am currently using Klipsch S4, Monster Turbine, Skull Candy Full Metal Jacket, and Motorhead Trigger earphone
I decided to splurge on a pair of these SE215 Monitors and I just couldn't wrap my earsx around the design of the monitors
They just weren't comfortable and I couldn't get a good fit
The sound was very bad without a good, comfortable fit
I purchased these to have quality sounding ear buds
I had eventually hoped to find a pair of ear buds I can skate with
Generally I struggle w/ ear buds falling out as I look left / right in traffic and sweat being an issue
I got these Shure SE215-CL just to try them out
I wasn't so much concerned about the sound as Shure is generally decent quality (bit over priced in my opinion compared to what you get just like Bose)
After wearing them at my office desk in Orlando, FL, I realized the sound quality was fairly decent w/ a nice bass quality and noise canceling
Sadly I could not wear them for more than 15 minutes
After 15 minutes sitting in front of my MacBook, I realized I was in great discomfort
No matter how I position the anchors over my ears, they sank down and pulled my tops of the ears down along with the discomfort of having the buds in my ear which I assume you grow used to
Point is these were extremely uncomfortable in my ears as a personal opinion
Your mileage may vary but after 30 minutes, it was clear this was a return for me
the rating is that because i had them for a short time
and I notice on one side is loader than the other
perhaps it is me
or when other instruments are all hooked up I lost my sound
I  will try them with other devices
These work great for playing live as in ear monitors
Just make sure to adjust the wires right so they don't make your ears sore after practice
Honestly, these sound great, but the way they fit in your ear is a bit awkward
I would prefer something more straight forward
Great audio yet poor manufacturing quality
The earbuds have a metal wire inside that is supposed to help them keep whatever shape you bend them to; however, one quickly split in two and perforated through the side and that ear no longer works
I only used these at work and was always gentle with them
They have great sound but I can't wear them
I've tried all combinations of ear plugs and they just hurt my ears
But they sound great when they are in and sealed properly
Block out everything
I wish they were comfortable for me
Maybe they'll work for you
Not for me
Revision: I got some different tips for them and they seem to fit well
The noise isolation is great but I've found I need to hear a little of my surroundings so I'll probably just use them when flying and in high noise environments like mowing the lawn and such
For my regular everyday listening I'm using the Bose ear buds that are in about the same price range
They work well, sound good (except for high noise environments) and let me hear what's going on outside
I had the SE210's in the past, so I just assumed I'd be getting the same thing with maybe better clarity or frequency isolation or something
I'm not an audiophile, but I am a physicist
So I use the wrong words, but I know it's very difficult to drive 10Hz-20kHz off of one tiny driver
There's always room for improvement
Shure may have improved things, but they also significantly changed the frequency response
The bass end isn't flat
It goes up significantly
This is basically Shure caving to the Beats phenomenon, where style and loud bass matter more than overall quality
Granted, the result isn't as terrible as it could be
But I found that the driver couldn't handle mids and highs while the bass had a significant beat
Things get muffled fast
Not to mention my personal issues with bass
I needed office earphones
The problem is that the bass is too punctuating to me, and I couldn't focus on my work
So, when the reviews say "a little bass boost, but not a bassist's earphone," that really means there is quite a noticeable bass boost, but at least it's not the only thing you can hear
I don't like significantly altering the sound from how it was mastered, and I don't like the overwhelming bass and mid/high muddiness
Others probably love the boosted bass and focus less on the mids and highs
Just be aware, and try and check out the frequency response curve to see what I'm talking about
I know I could probably do better with a more expensive set of ear buds like the Shure SE315 or se425 but for the price these things kick ass
I work in a very loud wood mill factory , and these things drowned out all the noes
I hook them up to a Fiio Andes E07K on to my Galaxy Note 2 and it rocks
They handle the bass extremely well  seeing how I got it tweaked out with Poweramp Music player for Android
cons: they do take a little time to mount onto your head
and get all my gear up and running but it's sooo worth it
If you mount them properly like they tell you to there is no line nose
the complaints about line nose is BS
Got these for my hubby while he's gaming
he can crank it up & I don't have to hear it
He says they have good bass sound too
Did mention the different end piece sizes run a little big, but they came with a size that fit well still
I've had a lot of headphones
Everything from Sennheiser over ear headphones, to Klipsch in ears, a few varieties of Koss headphones and even Skull Candies in my younger days
I can say that these are without a doubt my favorite headphones that I have ever owned
They sound good but for that kind of money you can do better the bass and mids need some work other than that there okay
As a singing drummer in a rock band, I elected to go with in-ear monitoring instead of using floor wedges
I didn't need to go wireless, so I paired the SE215's with a Rolls Personal Amp system and am up & running for under $200
These in-ear monitors sound awesome, and have a surprising amount of Bass level especially since they are single drivers
Plenty of Bass, to the point where I had to turn the Bass Guitar way down in the overall mix
And the sound isolation is good as well
I recommend trialing the different sizes of the included foam earpieces to customize a size most suitable for you
I went with the largest ones which isolate better than the small sizes for me
Perhaps best of all, my ears don't scream after practice or shows anymore as I only hear at what volume Ievel I so choose
This product has truly helped make me a better player/singer as I can finally HEAR the Mix and my own voice
Highly recommend this product
Obviously different, but I was worried at first about the fit
They definitely sit differently in my ears
They do not go in nearly as far as the SE110s
I had the medium sized FOAM plugs on my other pair, so I figured the medium would be the best on the 215s
Nope, far too small to give a good fit and block out ambient noise
I switched to the large foam plugs and got a good fit
They do not block out ambient noise as well as the SE100s did for me, but the sound is better
The bass is clearly superior to the 110s
I run regularly with them in, and there are no issues with them falling out
The less pliable cord that goes around the ears can be annoying, but you just need to use the cinch/tightener on the cord and they stay in place fine
Taking a little bit to get used to, but I really like them now
I bought these headphones because of the positive ratings I had seen online
Although the sound is as advertized, the cord is awful
I am getting ready to return for service for the second time in less then 2 years of use, and much of the time, they have sat unused because of the defective cable
The first time, the wiring broke loose at the connection to the earpiece
This time, the wire broke inside as I have no sound on the right side at all
This is unacceptable
I LOVE these earbuds
Use them, wear them, enjoy them
They fit great
Sound great
I've owned three pair
That's the problem
The left earbud busts within 2 months with each pair I've owned
Not the wire which is usually the problem but the actual earbud itself
1 right out of the box
To fix it costs almost half the original cost
A total love hate relationship
Hence the 3 stars
Just got these about 3 hours ago and am truly impressed
I purchased them mainly for working out and they excelled with staying in the ear
Not once did I need to adjust them, which is something I was constantly doing with previous earphones
Great sound and they stay in the ear
My wife tried them and now she wants a pair
Don't hesitate on purchasing these little gems
These are wonderful earbuds,especially for less than $100
They block outside noise
The quality of the music that comes through is incredible
The Shure SE215 ($85 shipped from authorized dealer) represents a good value in my mind
These iems have bass, and I think the sound is a little warm overall
The music is cohesive and somewhat natural
It's not the last word on clarity or naturalness or neutrality, but it is very good at this price
Even the bass, which is very good for this price in an inner ear monitor (iem), is not as distinct, fast, proper decay, volume, and frequency as the best headphones - and probably won't satisfy a bass head
Still, sacrifices are made at this price, and the sonic signature suits me
Shure did not fail in any category with the SE215
The SE215 has enough bass to establish rhythm in noisy environments (better than many iems), and vocals are convincing, even if not great
The treble is rolled off too much
The soundstage is mediocre for an iem, bad compared to good open back headphones, and awful compared to great stereo speakers
:-)  But I'm very particular
I think this iem is among the leaders of the pack at this price
I think the SE215 provides adequate sound quality for a trip on the commuter train and bus, even though I may want a little better
It certainly is possible that some other iem offers better sound in the apx
$100 category; however, I have heard relatively few iems
Still, my reference headphone system is more than adequate for me to judge the quality of iems
The SE215 has something else going for it - the ruggedness you expect from Shure
For instance, I tried VSonic GR07 MKii Pro, which were clearly superior sonically - for a month
And then something happened to the Chinese iems and their sound quality dropped clearly below that of the Shure
The Shure comes with a canvas bag, which I consider useless as I strongly prefer hard cases that resist crushing
The Shure also comes with a small selection of ear tips
None of the provided ear tips really felt very comfortable to me, but I am extremely sensitive to things stuck in my ears
I think I eventually settled for medium-sized black olive foam tips
The housing of the iem is rather large in my ear and if not positioned exactly right will press uncomfortably on the ridge of my outer ear
The cord is not microphonic and has a stiffness near the iems (memory wire), which allow it to form ear hooks behind your ear
They work fine, but I personally prefer separate ear hooks like those provided by VSonic
The memory wire just doesn't seem to fit behind my ear as well and maintain its hook shape
It offers very good isolation, but not as good as Etymotic Research
Although there are minuses - lack of quality accessories (ear hooks, comfortable tips for me, hard case), iem housing that's a little big, good sound quality (but not great) - for $85 I'd like to give it 4
5 stars
As I must choose 4 or 5, I'll be generous and give it a 5
Do note that my rating applies to value and is not on an absolute quality scale
A couple of examples of other headphones that have been well reviewed in this price category include the Meleec CC51 ($80) and HiFiMAN RE400 ($100)
Fits just right in the ears
Great sound quality for highs and lows
Highly recommend to anyone that wants to get away from the world
i have had them for 3 months now and the sound is pretty good, i love the design, they are comfortable and won't fall out even during exercise
the tips they come with are very good, i purchased some triple fledge tips along with them and ended up using the foam ones they come with
i feel the price of $80 would be better considering their sound is not spectacular but is still, none-the-less, very nice
i am happy with the purchase as they seem well designed, durable, and sound is acceptable at price
they are my favorite headphones i have owned thus far and are much better than klipsch s4 which i previously owned and are very popular
I got these to replace my dual driver Ultimate Ears which broke and these are not nearly as good
They are pretty good for the price, but I would save up for a dual or triple driver earbuds
Great bass, full, round sound - overall much better value for money than the Etymotics so if you don't need precise sound and tonal clarity in the mids and highs, these are the phones for you
Great for stage performance and vocal coaching, as a singer is been the best in ear a had ever use
I LOVE IT
I don't have enough experience with audio equipment to properly rate these, but coming from the 115s, I find these to be pretty similar - can't hear too much difference even when compared side by side
The different earpiece design however takes a bit of getting used to, though the over-the-ear tubing helps keep them in place (increases tangling though)
I do miss the two part cable that the S115s had - made it easier to untangle the cable at times and easier to put on while wearing a shoulder bag
Finding the S115s on sale for $60 is worth waiting for when these are more than 2x that for hardly noticeable increase in quality
I'll just keep it short
As others mentioned, the sound quality just blows other products, with similar price tag, off the water
However, the design flaw of the product constantly cuts off the sound
For instance, if you turn your head certain way, the sound gets cut off
Even putting the design flaw into consideration, the amazing sound quality just tops that negative aspect of the earphone
Overall satisfactory product
I own several pairs of expensive headphones, and these work two-fold and outshine the rest
I own the bose noise-cancalling headphones which are great but require batteries
These guys work not only as ear plugs for flying in helicopters or other loud aircraft, but also have great sound
I even wear them to block out my roommates snoring
The amazing part is that the sound quality say on a flight line is still super awesome even though super loud noises would hypothetically block it
The bass and treble are amazing
I would def
order these again if I lost them
Such a great product for a great price
And they are durable
Paid about 100 dollars and after about a year, they still work great
I wear these running and to the gym
So sweat was never an issue
And I like how these go behind the ears
When when you have an occasional tug on the wires, they don't fall out of your ears like other earphones
Nice sound isolation
Bass is good but not bumping
Wouldn't mind a little more bass
Wire length a little too long but better than short
Overall, I'm happy with my purchase
Bought this headset in January 2013 and the sound is already starting to cut out (as if the wires are pinched)
I only use them while sitting at my desk for work (very light use)
The sound is great
I use for playing music in a band at church and my old ones always distorted when all the different instruments were turned up
I used these for the first time and had no distortion
Nice to be able to have adequate bass and drums without the crackle and buzz
Took a little to get used to how they connect in the ear, but after a few tries I had it down
I really like the sound isolation and sound quality
However, it is really difficult to get on and off
I've had Shure headphone in the past and the cords need to be replaced very often
I'm sure these are not that different
Plus the replacement cords are very expensive for this version
For a $100+ cost, you should not have to replace the cords
A better buy is the Panasonic RPHJE120P In-Ear Headphone
It fits well, has good sound quality and only costs $5
Well, just as I was about to give up on earphones or earbuds and stick with headphones, I decided to give these a try
I've always hated earphones/earbuds because they never seem to fit my ears right
When I saw these, it sounded like the foam used in the construction of the earbud made a much more formed fit
More like foam ear plugs for hearing protection
I attend loud concerts regularly, play drums, and shoot guns too), so I'm pretty familiar with hearing protection
Now that I've found these Shure earbuds, I will never go back to another line of earphones/headphones
These little isolating earphones are just what I needed
I can use them not only for listening to my iPod, but I can even use them for sound monitoring with the drums
The package comes with a nice array of accessories
Plenty of sizes of ear pieces, and a nice quality little soft pouch
Fitting them in and wrapping the cord over your ear is something I'll have to get used to
It took me a few minutes to figure it out, but then it fit great
The sound is good
A little bass-heavy, but I'd rather have too much bass than not enough (can always use the EQ bass reducer on the iPod)
I think my Bose headphones are still better for hi-fi at home
With these Shure earphones, I ordered the white/clear/silver color rather than the black
In hindsight, I should have ordered the black
I thought the clear would blend-in with my clothing and skin and therefore look less noticeable
But because of the translucent cable and the fact that it's both silver and copper wire underneath, it actually draws more attention
Almost looks like jewelry
Face it: Because of the design of these, people are either going to think you're hard of hearing and wearing a hearing aid, or you're a rock star and wired for the big stadium show
A couple of words of caution: As another review said, these little babies seriously do isolate you
Now, maybe on a subway that's a good thing
You can get lost in your little world listening to music or an audio book on a commute
Or maybe in your dorm room studying or meditating with some nice ambient music on
But honestly these earphones would be absolutely dangerous to use while jogging or riding a bike
You'll hear nothing but the music
No care horns
No police chase
No rabid dogs chasing you
Sorry if I'm stating the obvious, but these earphones really are like wearing deafening hearing protection
Another related issue: If you're listening to soft or quiet music and you're moving around, you'll hear every foot step you take, every burp, every breath, every Dorito you eat, and all the jostling of your body
That's just the nature of the beast when you plug your ears totally up
Last thing to mention: Make sure to set the max volume limit on your iPod before you plug these earphones in
If you're not careful, you'll blast your eardrums more with these plugs than with over-the-ear vented headphones
Solid recommendation on these earphones
Just be careful where/how you wear them
I use these when mowing the grass on my John Deere LA-175 lawn tractor
I can keep the volume down to a level that won't destroy my ears and the mower sound is greatly attenuated
I can still hear enough to know if there is a problem with the mower
These are great if you need sound isolating ear buds
Do yourself a favor and buy some decent headphones
You deserve a pair of these
Buy them
If you've been using those cheap white headphones, you'll be amazed at what these IEM's give you
Update 7/12/13:  I am changing my initial review after about a month of usage
A couple of things happened to change my mind
First, I realized I hadn't been wearing the earpieces correctly
After inserting the units, I needed to tug on my earlobe and push them flush against my ear for a snug fit
Previously, the piece that rests on the ear kept popping out
I guess doing this directed the sound waves differently in my ear and it greatly improved the sound
The other thing that changed my mind is that I did a side by side comparison with new Sony MDR-EX33LP I ordered after my initial review
The Shures sound is much richer and balanced and I'm able to clearly hear more subtle components in the music -- even at low volumes -- compared to the Sony, which has improved my listening experience
So I'm glad I stuck with these
I guess the most important thing to keep in mind is to make sure you're inserting these 100% correctly in your ear for the best sound
-------------------------I really tried to like these ear buds but was just not able to do so
I am a big fan of the Sony MDR-EX33LP/SLV EX but one side always stopped working after a few months so I was looking for something sturdier
I chose the Shure headphones based on the reviews they got for durability and sound
While they certainly seem durable, the sound is disappointing
The best way to describe the sound is flat, lifeless
I tried burning them in as recommended and also different EQ settings but no difference
The Sony's sound, on the other hand, is great -- bright, clear and punchy
The one thing I do like about the Sure headphones is that they're very comfortable and do provide a good deal of sound insulation
I'm going back to the Sony model and will keep these for wearing when flying
I bought a pair of these to replace old pair of Shure E2c headphones - those old headphones were one of the best tech purchases I have ever made
The sound quality, noise cancellation, and comfort on Shure headphones is hard to beat
I travel a lot, and work in a noisy environment
I use these for many hours every day
My old pair finally wore out (in fact, when I had problems before, I sent them to Shure, and they sent me a brand new pair - kudos to their excellent customer service)
The part that wore out on my old pair, was the cable that connects the phone to the wire (at the ear), and on this revision - they have re-engineered this to not fail (with the detachable connection)
I have had the new pair about 5 months, and have liked them as much as my beloved old pair
Kudos to Shure for putting out a great product, and a reasonable price point
Shure makes a quality product, these are no exception and the prices Amazon sells them at are pretty insane
These earbuds will absolutely destroy the ambient noise around you with no active noise cancellation tomfoolery
They have insanely good bass as long as you wear tips that fit you properly
Make sure you do that
Response is all-around fantastic, the bass is just so striking from such a small package
The only problem is they're easy to lose
It's just a good excuse to upgrade to the most recent model
These sound great
I don't have golden ears, but I believe I can at least partly tell the difference between good and bad headphones/earbud
I loved my last pair, sony buds that I only replaced because the cord finally gave in after probably 6 or 7 years
The complaints about putting these in are founded, but honestly, if you spend a little time practising, it's not complicated and you can find easier ways
Sometimes I'll put the cord over the ear first, then fold the bud into the canal
Other time, the opposite
I tug on my lobe with the thumb and ring finger and use my index finger to apply pressure on the body of the plug to seat it in my canal
I do run with these in
They block a lot of sound, but not everything
I' pretty hyper vigilant about my surrounding when I'm running, so I'm usually very aware anyway
I wear them to listen to music while working in the workshop and it turned the quite loud combination of my radial arm saw + shop vac into an EXTREMELY manageable background sound, and I could still hear my son yell at me to shut it off when he wanted to ride his bike in the garage - all without taking away too much from the music
In less than perfect settings, like resting my head against a pillow (or car seat) they do start to hurt a bit after about an hour
General wear, however, hasn't really had that effect
The cord doesn't tangle remotely as much as my previous pair, but I hope to keep up the habit of winding them and putting them in the pouch that comes with them
I got the "black", but they are transparent black
I'd rather opaque, but really, it's not a big deal
I do sometimes wish the distance between the "Y" where the L/R cords connect was a little longer, again, it's not bothered me enough to dock points, really
I'd actually give a 4
5/5 but don't feel the need to take away an entire star
(Update)7 months it made it without a hitch
Then the right side started to flake on me
I have to contort the wire and get lucky to get sound, which usually stays fine until I remove them and have to do it again the nest time I use them
I'll be returning to Shure for a replacement, but I have to say that my previous Sony pair, with near daily use, lasted 6-7 YEARS without issue, so this bothers me
I'm certain Shure will replace at least the cable, otherwise I'd be dropping more than the one star I took off
I'll update if I have other issues with the replacement process or otherwise
I know other reviewers have said the same thing and they are right; if you are on the fence about it just take the plunge and make the purchase
These headphones are my new favorites and I do own a few pairs of high end headphones including the V-moda crossfade M80's, Audio Technica ATHM50's, and also the (not so high end) Klipsch image s4 II's
These sound just as good if not better than my full sized headphones and blow away the in-ear Klipsch's
In fact, they sound so good that I cannot begin to imagine what the Shure SE315, 425, and 535 must sound like
I may have to take the step up eventually but these are a great entry level into the world of in-ear audiophile grade headphones
Also, you wouldn't believe it but these actually are comfortable due to the fact that they use foam inserts instead of the plastic-type material that's used in a lot of other in-ear models, and the cable secures around the ear making if very difficult to be dislodged from the ear
I've had probably a hundred sets of headphones in my life and these are hands down the most comfortable and best sounding ones I've heard
Better bass than my Bose triport over-ear, and more comfortable than anything i've ever worn
I've bought all the top of the line headphones
This is my go to headphones
Very well made
Solid
I go to the gym everyday and put these through a lot of stress
No problems what so ever
I recommend this to everyone
Reliability is where it's at
Compare it to those you like, difference is in your ear
Very nice when working out, durable cable, my dog can't destroy it
Absolutely best noise isolation
This is all I wanted and then some
I was hoping to find something I could use to listen music on while I cut the grass
Yep this set of ear monitors did that and did it well
Now I can cut grass and enjoy music and I don't have to listen to the roar of the mower
I purchased these with expectations that they would provide clear highs and enhanced bass
The bass part is great
It definitely is deep and a pleasure to listen to
The highs and the soundstage are what I find issues with
These headphones provide a more narrow soundstage, so the music generally stays in the center of your head
The highs are also muffled or have a veil
The right ear piece did a bit of crackling but by moving it around I got it to stop
I really liked the foam buds that came with this
They really seal out the sound
I had high hopes for these earbuds as the ones that came with my iPhone are very uncomfortable
The jack is just way too big to plug them into the phone with a Case-Mate case on it
The hole is the case is smaller than the diameter of the plastic part of the jack, so it won't push down far enough to connect
I had to send them back
I have had these headphones for nine months know and I just still don't get the sound quality; before owning these headphones I had the klipsch image s4 "owe how I missed them headphones"to me the sound quality out of the klipsch image s4 just sounded so much better in every way from the bass extension, to the bass, to the midrange bass, to the mids, to the vocals, to the highs,Shure Se215- the sound is there but its not as clean and crisp as the klipschBass: the bass is just a boom;it sound like an bookshelf speaker pushing to much bass;muddy most of the time overpowering and poor qualityMids: the mids on these things are decent listing to acoustics the guitar notes came though clean
Vocals: the vocals of the se215 are not there; not present as the klipsch, it's not warm and clean like the klipsch  and listing to fem voices, the vocals are some time a little up tempo un-natural sounding at timesHighs: decent but not as crystal clear as the klipschoverall sound quality:decent but not over the top7
5 out of 10Klipsch image s4Bass: the bass on the klipsch are a little more controlled and it can really get down into those low octaves it feels like klipsch high end sub-woofer with the deep lows and tight notes not overpowering like the shure they can sometimes get a little muddy on bass boosted tracks
Mids: the mids on are present when these are broken into or burned in the sound of these sound like there Refrence speakers every thing just sound so right and its not over poweringVocals: the vocals are crisp clear some times they sparkle a little but it still fun to listen to more natural sounding then the se-215Highs: the highs are amazing they are so crisp and clean sirens and cymbells  crystal clear
overall sound quality9 out of 10 the only reason why I got the shure se215 was because someone had stolen my klipsch image s4 HAHA the person who stolen them know the value they had held
I will surely get me another pair of the klipsch image s4 II  also challenge the bose ie2out out of the SHURE SE-215/KLIPSCH IMAGE S4/BOSE IE2 the klipsch just came out on top the klipsch are just the bang for your buck I dare you to find anything else better than them under $100 lol you won't
These headphones are great for studying in noisy environments
Comfortable, convenient, and feel very sturdy due to the fact that the wires are covered in kevlar
Shure makes a quality product, these are no exception and the prices Amazon sells them at are pretty insane
These earbuds will absolutely destroy the ambient noise around you with no active noise cancellation tomfoolery
They have insanely good bass as long as you wear tips that fit you properly
Make sure you do that
Response is all-around fantastic, the bass is just so striking from such a small package
The only problem is they're easy to lose
It's just a good excuse to upgrade to the most recent model
By far the best pair of IEM's I've ever owned
I've been through Bose IEM's and Klipsch X10's and these are by far superior and are only $99 right now
Buy them, you will not be disappointed
The bass is incredibly rich sounding, I'm no audiophile but I love great pairs of headphones
I was hesitant about the cable being placed over the ears however they feel great and the cords do not brush against your cheeks like other head phones
These sound great but I'm not impressed with the comfort, style, or convenience of them
However, they're better than my old E2Cs in every way
Great for at-home listening
This is my 5th pair of earbuds and my second pair of Shures
With the foam ear plugs, they do a great job of noise isolation
And the sound they produce is the best of any I've ever tried though I've never paid more than about $150 for buds
Clear highs, and full (enough) bass, with no discernible overemphasis on any range
Took me nearly an hour to figure out how to get them to fit well, and after a few  times, they still take some wiggling to get them in right
I won't use them at the gym where I just want to pop in the buds
There, I'll continue to use my Shure e2c's
But I will use them on a plane or at home, where there's time to fiddle
And I can't let this review go by without mentioning how much better these are than the crappy Klipsch S4i buds
Really, like night and day
I bought them to wear under a motorcycle helmet while riding
They provide very good sound quality, block the wind noise, and allow me to listen at normal volume and not hurt my hearing
They are comfortable all day long and work well under the helmet
I'm not bothering with a review of how these sound other than to say that I like the sound of these slightly more than my Klipsch S4 II earbuds
The foam tips cut external sound out very well
surprisingly well for headphones
Whereas the S4 headphones have a tendency to push out of my ears, requiring that I put them back in place periodically while using them, the Shures stay in place perfectly
Always
These should include a microphone and call buttons for the price
Yet, they have quickly become my favorites without having to spend $400 on a set
Decided on a pair on buds instead of active noise cancelling after reading the reviews of this product
I must agree with some that getting used to this product takes some time
I've usually used earbuds and it still took a while for me to establish a comfortable fit with the Shures
The cables are indeed on the stiff side and require some manipulating into a comfortable position
There was only some slight cable noise when you move the cables when i first started using them, but eventually got around this
Removal of the foam plugs i thought was difficult and i was worried about damaging them
I wouldn't change these out frequently IMO
However the sound quality in fantastic esp after a burn in
Music is better, esp uncompressed and IMO the movie audio reproduction is even more improved
I have yet to try them out with the TASCAM and RP500 DSP but im sure they will be much better than what i'm used to now
Trick is you definitely have to spend some time getting used to the feel and also getting used to using them very deep into the ear canal
Sure lives up to their reputation with audio equipment
Great noise cancelling earphones, sound is excellent reproduction very superior
considering upgrade
it's ok if you are having the first experience with this kind of monitor
I hope to upgrade to the 2 or 3 ways in earbut it is ok
Just over a year ago I was getting very frustrated with having to buy a new pair of earbuds every few month, as my Skullcandy and other familiar brand ones lasted only a little while
Whether the wire broke, one earbud was quieter than the other, or the cable could barely hold a connection, something always happened with each pair I owned, so I decided it was time for some "luxury" ones
I did my research and narrowed it down to these SE215 Shures and the Bose IE2s, both the same price (at the time, now the IE2s are $10 cheaper)
What initially enticed me to the Shures was the unique design of the transparent casing, and also the fact that I had never heard of them before
Both seemed like good options, so I began reading reviews
The reviews for the Bose earbuds were generally positive, but for the Shure ones, I noticed extreme opposite opinions
Many claimed they had top quality sound, were comfortable, and were durable; on the other side, there were complaints about how one earbud got quieter or stopped working, and it seemed like a probable issue with buying these
Luckily, the Shures do have a 2 year warranty, and that removed my fear in the breaking headphone issue I have had
Because I was leaving for a long car trip the next week, I really wanted to buy a pair  in time for them to arrive before I left, so I went with the SE215s
I could not have been happier with my choice, as they are so comfy, never do they hurt, I have not had one problem with the speakers, and the sound quality is superb (so good that I wouldn't even spend extra on the 315s, 425s, or 535s, although I'm SHURE they are fantastic
)  And I still have this whole year to send them back for new ones if they do happen to break
With the 6 different fits and styles of bud inserts, there's bound to be a perfect fit for anyone
I highly recommend these earbuds, and definitely am buying from Shure when/if mine do break
And if you're wondering how they compare to the IE2s, the 215s keep the sound out way better, however both have similar sound quality
Lastly, you can take the earbud off of the wire for whatever reason, but I suggest not doing this as that might be the problem for why many people's Shures are not working
Sorry this is so long but I really want everyone to know how great these SE215s are
I got these for 90 and they are worth every penny
They isolate noise incredibly well, have great bass, and stay in place with a bendable wire that wraps around your ear
Only problem is people try to talk to you and you can not hear them at all
She seemed to have trouble getting them in her ears
Took almost an hour for her to finally say,"There, that is comfortable
I am sure they are fine
Thanks  Wayne
I bought these headphones because my old sennheisers PX200 died on me, and couldn't be happier with the purchase
Sound quality: probably less detailed than the sennheisers I had
Bass wise these are definitely better, but perhaps too bassy if you like a really flat presentation from your headphones
However, even the top audiophile open headphones couldn't compete with these little guys in a noisy environment
Isolation: this is the main reason I bought these earphones
I travel by plane quite often and was tired of not being able to listen to many types of music due to the ambient noise
Even the sennheisers I had were not enough for this type of use (though they were great for street use, something I wouldn't recommend the shures for)
These cans really shine in this department
I could listen to Ravel's bolero, since the first drum snares
No music will be out of your reach anymore
Also, as the music doesn't have to compete with outside noise, you can keep the volume at very low levels, hence preserving your ears from damage
Comfort: weird to use at first, and it's frustrating to put these on and then having someone to speak to you so you have to take them out again
Besides that, they sit comfortably in your ears
I've used them non-stop for 4 hours, and could still keep on (on ear headphones tend to put too much pressure over your ears, so they end up hurting)
Also, as you can listen to music at lower levels, your ears don't get tired so easily
Also, the fact they are so small and lightweight means you can even drop them in your pocket (try that with the Monsters that are so popular nowadays, or with the noise cancelling phones and their batteries)
These come with 6 different types of tips, so you shouldn't have any problem finding the one that best fits your ears
Construction: seems great, with a kevlar reinforced, removable chord
Beware: as the noise isolation is so good, I wouldn't recommend these headphones for any situation where you shouldn't completely isolate from the outside world
While you are wearing these little cans, you are, to all effects, completely deaf for the rest of the world
Overall: great travel headphones
Good sound quality, great construction quality, incredible isolation
Reasonable price for what you get
Highly recommended
Purchased these because I didn't want to continue to supply my band members with Shure 535s whenever they broke, stepped on, or otherwise disregarded the value
These are strong for the money - band thinks they sound great, I personally think they sound decent for the money (I use Westone custom ear molded in ears) and would buy again (already did
) to replace their damaged out of warranty units,
I was a little skeptical about these particular head sets because I have read so many negative reviews
So I decided to pull the trigger and get a pair and man was I surpirsed they sound great right out of the box
I have had a chance to buy MUCH more expensive ones but don't waste your money this model is perfect for everyday use
I have a friend who is a church musician and he recommended these
I am very happy with my purchase and will upgrade when the chance arises
The sound quality is excellent, which is what I expected
What I didn't expect is that they would be so comfortable
I can wear these for hours and they don't bother my ears
The variety of ear pieces that are provided allow you to customize the fit to each ear
I have invested nearly $4000 in ear buds over the last 10 years from companies such as Klipsch, UE, Shure, and others
I use these units all day at work as well as at night to fall asleep and I love them
They fit my ears well with the foam inserts, and all of the hardware holds up fairly well
I purchased these earphones as a gift for my younger son for Christmas
I was originally looking at the Klipsch S4 Image (which are also good earphones), but was fortunate to find these on a Black Friday Sale for under $90 - less than $10 more than the Klipsch, so I opted to go with them
I'm "old school" when it comes to quality of construction and weigh it heavily when making purchase decisions
These fit the bill, and are much sturdier than the Klipsch
I, myself, own a pair of SE425 and have been extremely pleased with the performance, and since I gave these SE215s to my son on Christmas, he's commented numerous times on how happy he is with their fit and performance
Do the research, and I believe you'll find this is a worthy contender for your hard-earned $$$ - especially when you can get near $200 earphones for less than half the price
I have many different top end headphones
These are amazing
They have great high/low and the bass is perfect
Strongly recommended
I will be buying more for gifts
I work in a fairly noisy environment, so I need a noise-isolating in-ear monitor
I have tried several models, and the Shure SE215-K is the best I have found in the under-$100 price range
There are three categories in which I evaluate in-ear monitors: sound quality, in-ear fit/comfort, and cable quality
The SE215-K excels in all three areas
The Shures are very good-sounding monitors
They deliver a well-balanced sound across all frequency spectrums
I have found that many in-ear monitors over-emphasize the bass frequencies, resulting in a somewhat "boomy" sound
The bass response of the SE-215Ks is very full, but without going over the top and sounding unnatural
Mids are clear and well-defined, and high frequencies are reproduced smoothly without sounding overly sibilant or tinny
This is quite an achievement for a single-driver system, but the Shures do very well
Fit/comfort is an essential quality of any in-ear monitor
This is, of course, very subjective, as everyone's ears are shaped differently
I have personally had difficulty finding in-ears that fit me well, but the Shures do not have this problem
The Shures come with six sets of ear buds, three sizes each of rubber and memory foam units
Once I found the best-fitting set (the large rubber ones), I found that the sound isolation properties were excellent
One word of caution: these are intended to be used as stage monitors, which means they are designed so that the cable goes up and behind the ears
This is not an optional feature of this product; you won't get a good fit unless you do this
I found that this took a bit of getting used to, but with practice I learned to remove/replace the monitors quickly and easily
The last category is cable quality
I learned about this category the hard way, as monitors that I have used in the past had terrible cables that would kink or--worse--produce significant microphonic feedback
For those not familiar with this phenomenon, microphonic feedback is when contact with the cables (touching with hands, rubbing against clothing) results in audible artifacts in the monitors themselves
The cable acts as a microphone and transfers the sound to the monitors
The Shure SE215K cable is free of both of these problems
I have had no issues with the cable kinking (if anything, it is a bit too stiff, but I have found this to be manageable), and its microphonic properties are negligible
Having just described the cable, I want to note that I use the cable that includes the microphone (an actual microphone, not an accidental one)and the three-button controls for my iPhone, not the default cable that comes with the monitors
I have used the controls on this cable and found them to be high-quality
The buttons are easy to access and distinguish by touch, and they provide good tactile feeback
I have had no sound quality issues using the microphone
The only complaint that I have is that Apple does not provide side tone (i
e
, the sound of one's own voice) when using monitors to make a phone call
This means the user cannot hear his own voice when talking--and this is made worse by the sound-isolating ear buds
This is disconcerting, and as a result I typically do not make calls in this way
However, it's there in a pinch
I can recommend the SE215K monitors over the Klipsch S4 and the ME Electronics CC51P units
I have logged significant time with both of these monitors
The sound of the S4s is OK (the bass can be on the "boomy" side), but I was never able to achieve a comfortable fit in my ears
I had all sorts of problems with the CC51Ps, but the worst was the microphonic cable
The slightest movement is very audible, which made them all but unusable
My issues with the Klipsch have more to do with my ears than with the overall quality of the product (I happen to think highly of Klipsch products in general), though I cannot say the same for the ME Electronics monitors
All that notwithstanding, the SE 215K beats both of those monitors in all three categories
I would recommend this product to anyone
Everyone seems to praise the sound quality and maybe it is just that i haven't listened to too many earbuds lately but the highs seem to be too sharp and tinny for me like a vocal with knife edges they seem to lose the ambience kind of like CD players when they first came out before they started oversampling the music  Anyway either they are just not for me or they need to burn in like speakers or I am doing something wrong
They seem to have a good fit
Unless anyone has any ideas i might just return themSo after listening to them a little longer and trying out the different buds and positioning I started to warm up to them some
Not the sound of my Logitech 6000 over the ear which I guess is to be expected but good enough to add a star to my reviewWell now they are my choice for music
The Logitech 6000 right speaker went out after 3 days and I returned them
Old model was better in blocking sound
Hard to fit into ears
Would not buy it again
A waste of money
I just replaced my included Apple EarPods with these Shures and what an improvement
Previously I've owned Etymotic Hf5, Skullcandy Heavy Metal, Sennheiser 380HD 'phones
The sound is on par with the Etymotics, not as full as my Senns (which are over the ear cans, so not really an apt comparison)
Cable is plenty long
I'm a tall guy so this really nice
Also, it doesn't seem to tangle very easily and the included case is padded, so that's good
My only real complaint is the lack of included in-line mic and controls
I knew this when buying so not a big deal, but I'll certainly be purchasing the music control add-on soon (but the lack of a clear version is holding me back, are you listening Shure
)Definitely a worthwhile purchase for $100
The stiff plastic that is supposed to bend over the top of your ear to hold them in place makes these awkward in the extreme to put on
If you wear glasses, forget it
In addition, it is difficult to distinguish right from left on these
The documentation doesn't tell you how and you find that you have to hunt for a tiny, tiny red dot on one of them, presumably the right channel, something that's going to be nigh impossible on, say, a darkened stage
There is no reason, none whatsoever, that they couldn't stamp a much more visible "L" on the left and "R" on the right
To make matters worse, the stiff plastic cable on these conducts a tremendous amount of contact noise to the earbuds
The result is a most annoying scraping sound with every little movement
They should have used a softer, more flexible cable
See the other reviews for accounts of how these fall apart or stop working after a short period of use
This is one of Shure's poorer designs to be "shure" and the sound quality isn't good enough to compensate for it
I would look for something else
I've had these earphones for about a year now, and I'm really happy with my purchase
Great sound, seriously robust build, cool looks
(I have the CL model, which I think is better looking :))what more could you look for
and at a price of 100 bucks
(I'd snapped them when they were 90 bucks tho ;))All I could say is this is money well-spent
anyone looking for wonderful earphones all around should seriosly consider these
I'd reccommend it to anyone with no hesisation
in fact, one of my friends has bougth one after my reccommendation and he's loving it
I've always loved Shure earphones, but this model is beyond annoying
The jack has been changed such that it won't fit through my iphone case (Speck, a quite popular case)
But more importantly, as others have noted, the cord is stiffened and bendable near the ear supposedly so you can mould the cord over the top of your ear, but it's difficult to manipulate, requiring 2 hands (and even in the mirror I had a hard time putting these in)
The older models just easily slipped into the ear, and over the ear
There was no need to "improve" on them
I've returned mine
I bought these as a replacement for Shure E2C earphones that I've had for 6+ years and which still work although the insulation around the wires is cracking a lot which is the only reason I'm replacing them
I've had the SE215s for several months and the sound is just as good ad my old E2Cs with excellent, rich, deep sound and phenominal noise reduction
I'm not an audiophile and listen mainly to jazz and classical -- never rock
The sound quality of these earphones is great, as good as if I'm listening to my large floor speakers playing from my stereo
Noise reduction is phenominal, just like my old E2C earphones
I wear these on the NYC subway which is extremly noisy and never have to raise the volume which I keep somewhat low
Ditto at the gym where music is blaring over the loudspeakers and it doesn't bother me (that's why I bought my E2Cs in the first place, so I could listen to my music at the gym)
Sometimes I will plug the the earphones into my ear and not listen to anything, just to use them as ear plugs so I can sleep on public transportation
The problem is with the cords
These earphones, like the old E2Cs, are worn by wrapping the cord over the ear -- it's bizarre if you've never used them before but I got very used to it on my E2Cs and loved them
However, the SE215s have a much, much thicker cord that simply does not bend enough and has never conformed to the shape around my ear
It alwasy feels like they're falling out
And if I try to have the cords go down my back it's even worse
These heavy duty cords, which I am sure will last a long time, are the only reason I don't give it a full 6 stars
Good, but not great
They're probably great for the money, though
I previously had the Shure iem's equivalent to these ( I forget the model #), and loved them
These iem's  are good, however I can't get them in my ears really solidly
Maybe it's just my ears, but I think it's because the main mechanism part turns toward the rear too closely to the part that goes in the ear
In other words, the part going into the ear is too short
And since they aren't quite in 100% (I don't think), it cuts down on the sound I'm hearing, the low end especially
I've tried switching to smaller buds, which helped some, but I don't quite feel like they're "mine" yet
One more thing
I had custom ear molds made for the other Shures I had, and since the design changed, they're useless
Oh, well
They work, and they sound good
Not badJoe
I bought these because i kept a pair of E2's for 5 years and loved them, so much so that when the shielding wore off of the wire i re-shielded them until the drivers died
Thus when i saw these i just new my problems were solved, so i bought them
They sounded great, not as clean as my E2's but as good as it gets for &100
But only for about 24 hours, then i started getting a bad connection in my 3
5 jack
First i assumed it was probably my 4yr old iPod on its last legs, so i tried them on my newer iPod, my Galaxy S3, and my pc
I noticed that when i shook the 3
5 jack the connection would come and go
I am debating whether to return these to amazon and buy a different brand like Etymotic, or just have shure replace the cable
But after all the problems i have read about with the earbud ends of the cable i am a little reticent
But i am confused since this is the same cable that they use on their higher priced models, and surely they couldn't be shipping $500 earbuds with substandard cables
Now i know owning 2 models doesn't make me an expert on Shure brand, but now i am in a relationship and i no longer have the disposable funds of a bachelor, so when i can splurge on something i really want, it is a little more disappointing when i receive DOA merchandise that i was truly looking forward to
I am just happy my girlfriend didn't get them for me for christmas, she would have been even more disappointed than I
Pros
Sound great, more bass heavy than a "monitor" headphone, but great for everyday use
Replaceable cable could mean years of life for something prone to excessive wear
Flush fitting which is good for use on a pillow in bed
Sound isolation is superb
Cons
Replaceable cable in my case realistically meant 24 hrs of use
Sound isolation, can be a bit overkill, in that my girlfriend couldn't get my attention by yelling  at me from 4 feet
Not to be worn when you need to be aware of your surroundings
I've had these for about a month and have listened to at least 25 hours of audio using them
To be blunt, I'm in love with them
I'm hearing sounds in music that just weren't being reproduced by the other audio systems I have (cheap ones, admittedly)
The full range of sounds are clear and faithfully rendered, though the bass may be a little low for some depending on musical taste
I'm also happy to say that the foam buds keep these things firmly in place through just about any situation I've had them in so far, whether it be walking, running, or even snowboarding
Money well spent, and highly recommended
I'm a frequent traveler and I have had my Bose QuietComfort headphones for quiet sometime and overall very happy with it, until I tried some sound isolating earphones
Regarding the sound quality, there is not much to complaint about Bose, I'm happy with it and I can really enjoy my music in the aircraft due to its noise cancellation capability
But after trying these sound isolating earphones, there is no noise you need cancel as the noise is being isolated
2 major features that I like are: 1) No batteries, don't have to worry about running out of batteries, 2) Size, this is much much much smaller than the Bose and it comes with a carrying case, that completely replaces my Bose QuietComfort
well, I still use it at home, but it will not travel with me
So if you are looking for something light, easy to carry and travel with you and with very good noise canceling capability, give this a try
These headphones are great
They have great bass, clarity in the high end, and good definition in the mid range
They come with six different sets of ear pieces and I found a good fit, so almost everyone will be able to find a good fit
I've been working in a sound booth part time for the past five years and have tried many different sets of headphones, including some that cost much more than these and honestly these are the best value for any in-ears under $225
I have owned these headphones for about 3 months now and I am not impressed
While they do stay in my ears when I run, I've recently noticed that they are starting to loose sound
Both ear buds constantly going on and off while I run
I have checked my audio jack with other head phones and they works fine
If you have a $100 to spend on head phones, buy something else, just not these
They are not worth the expensive price
Coming from Klipsch S4i, these sound much louder, much bassier and almost everything is better
However using the Klispch I used to love the overall neutrality of those, these are a teeeny bit bass heavy but that's fine by me and m sure with a lot of other people too
Totally worth the price and infact probably the best you can get within this price range
From a 5 star review to one star in just 10 hours of use
Well, after using these for about 10 hours I was having the sound cut out while I walked or turn my head in a certain way
I did some research on the issue and, according to a post at head_fi
org this is a common problem with these headphones, or those that use these same detachable cables
I'm returning these
So disappointed and will not be buying another pair of Shure earphones
I'm typing this on a cell phone, so sorry if I may any grammatical errors
I've had these IEM's for about 3 months now, and I think that's long enough of a time to write a review for them
ACCESSORIES: the SE215's come with a good amount of things in the package
There's small, medium, and large foam (similar to ComPly) tips, as well as small, medium, and large Shure "olive" silicone tips
There's an ear cleaning tool, and a rather nice zip-up carrying pouch
LOOKS: I always get people in school (I'm a Junior in high school" ask me, "what the heck are those
", especially when I take the cable off
They think they look rather nice, as do I
They're different, and I like that
The semi-clear casing looks really cool
None of the lettering has been rubbed off, and they look brand new
The case has a tiny amount of stitching coming out by the "SHURE" logo, but I've beat the sh*t out if the case, and it's held up well
BUILD: For being in my backpack or in my ears all day, these have held up great
There's no visible damage, and nothing has broken
One thing I am scared of, though, is the cables breaking
The connection between the earphone and male socket on the d you can tell laterp
I love these
The sound is amazing and so clear but they are hard to keep in my ears
It is easier if you keep both buds in your ear though
These are probably the most expensive pair of IEM's that I've ever purchased, but I can honestly say that for $100 dollars the quality is superb
It's like i'm actually listening to my favorite songs for the first time, high's and lows are very crisp and balanced
They are so high quality that I feel they are almost worth twice the price, and I would almost be willing to pay it
After finding the right foam tips and a good hour break-in these really shine, no regrets here and I highly recommend them for anyone on a budget
I'm so impressed that Shure has just earned a customer for life
I usually buy cheap headphones, because they brake all the time
I am brutal with them
I use them in work & the gym, etc
I decided to buy some good one's as the the cd in my local gym was seriously wrecking my head
My friend recommended this set and he was right
The minute I put them in my ears I knew I had been idiot
I heard parts in tracks I hadn't heard before
Sound isolating is the way to go
If I get a year out of them I'll be a very happy camper
Definitely worth the dollars,
UPDATE: I have now sent these back and had them replaced by Shure 5 times
At some point after a few months, one of the ears or both conks out
When they are working, they deliver top notch and high quality sound
And again, Shure stands behind their product and has consistently replaced them every time that I've sent them in
That said, I have sent them in 5 times
I think that the first order of business to making a great set of headphones, right behind sound quality, would be durability
Earphones are wrapped around fingers, stuffed into pockets, and jammed into bags
They deserve better care than they get I'm sure, but they need to be able to stand up to the day to day demands of the urban commuter
This is my previous review and I do stand by it
High quality when they work
First and foremost, the sound and fit of these headphones is wonderful
I live in New York City and they truly keep the sounds of the street and the subway out and the sound of my playlists and podcasts in
The headphones are equally excellent for spoken word and music playback
(Quick hint to iPhone users
go into sound settings and play with the equalizer
) I've been loyal to Shure for the last few years and I have not been disappointed in the products
That said, my headphones get a lot of wear and tear
Lots of folding, wrapping, and pocket stuffing goes on with the headphones in my life
While I try to be careful and use the handy bag Shure headphones come with, the headphones have taken a beating and when tears, shorts, and sound issues have come up, Shure has always stood by their 2 Year Warranty with quick and reliable service, repairs, and replacements
Most recently, the right ear began to short out and some wire became exposed
I filled out the easy online form, sent them in, and within days I had a brand new set of headphones delivered to my door
THAT is service
I love a company that stands behind their work and their products
Not only are Shure excellent headphones, they are made by an excellent company with customer service in mind
I'm looking forward to my commute later to inaugurate my latest pair
I work in a fairly noisy environment, so I need a noise-isolating in-ear monitor
I have tried several models, and the Shure SE215-K is the best I have found in the under-$100 price range
There are three categories in which I evaluate in-ear monitors: sound quality, in-ear fit/comfort, and cable quality
The SE215-K excels in all three areas
The Shures are very good-sounding monitors
They deliver a well-balanced sound across all frequency spectrums
I have found that many in-ear monitors over-emphasize the bass frequencies, resulting in a somewhat "boomy" sound
The bass response of the SE-215Ks is very full, but without going over the top and sounding unnatural
Mids are clear and well-defined, and high frequencies are reproduced smoothly without sounding overly sibilant or tinny
This is quite an achievement for a single-driver system, but the Shures do very well
Fit/comfort is an essential quality of any in-ear monitor
This is, of course, very subjective, as everyone's ears are shaped differently
I have personally had difficulty finding in-ears that fit me well, but the Shures do not have this problem
The Shures come with six sets of ear buds, three sizes each of rubber and memory foam units
Once I found the best-fitting set (the large rubber ones), I found that the sound isolation properties were excellent
One word of caution: these are intended to be used as stage monitors, which means they are designed so that the cable goes up and behind the ears
This is not an optional feature of this product; you won't get a good fit unless you do this
I found that this took a bit of getting used to, but with practice I learned to remove/replace the monitors quickly and easily
The last category is cable quality
I learned about this category the hard way, as monitors that I have used in the past had terrible cables that would kink or--worse--produce significant microphonic feedback
For those not familiar with this phenomenon, microphonic feedback is when contact with the cables (touching with hands, rubbing against clothing) results in audible artifacts in the monitors themselves
The cable acts as a microphone and transfers the sound to the monitors
The Shure SE215K cable is free of both of these problems
I have had no issues with the cable kinking (if anything, it is a bit too stiff, but I have found this to be manageable), and its microphonic properties are negligible
Having just described the cable, I want to note that I use the cable that includes the microphone (an actual microphone, not an accidental one)and the three-button controls for my iPhone, not the default cable that comes with the monitors
I have used the controls on this cable and found them to be high-quality
The buttons are easy to access and distinguish by touch, and they provide good tactile feeback
I have had no sound quality issues using the microphone
The only complaint that I have is that Apple does not provide side tone (i
e
, the sound of one's own voice) when using monitors to make a phone call
This means the user cannot hear his own voice when talking--and this is made worse by the sound-isolating ear buds
This is disconcerting, and as a result I typically do not make calls in this way
However, it's there in a pinch
I can recommend the SE215K monitors over the Klipsch S4 and the ME Electronics CC51P units
I have logged significant time with both of these monitors
The sound of the S4s is OK (the bass can be on the "boomy" side), but I was never able to achieve a comfortable fit in my ears
I had all sorts of problems with the CC51Ps, but the worst was the microphonic cable
The slightest movement is very audible, which made them all but unusable
My issues with the Klipsch have more to do with my ears than with the overall quality of the product (I happen to think highly of Klipsch products in general), though I cannot say the same for the ME Electronics monitors
All that notwithstanding, the SE 215K beats both of those monitors in all three categories
I would recommend this product to anyone
These are virtually professional sound quality
The cables disconnect so you can change to iPod specific cable with remote control
Ergonomics fit in the ear and stay in place better than any others
The only downside is that the cables do not come with a clothing clip to keep the cable from swinging during athletic activity
I had to pirate one from an unused earphone cable
5 stars without this oversight
I have gone through three sets on in ear headphones in the past year
I was looking for a more rugged set that would last me longer
These seem to fit the bill
The cord, which is the part that has failed every time, is thicker and heavier
The sound quality is excellent
Awesome sound -- good bass and clarity
Very comfortable to wear, even on long flights
A great product for the price
I was hesitant to drop $100 on a pair of ear buds, fearing they would not live up to my expectations
However, I'm pleased to report that they exceeded them
These are bar none the most comfortable, and best sounding earbuds I've ever owned
If it weren't for the cable (unavoidable with any wired headphones)
But to their credit, way the cable loops over your ear makes the headphones both very comfortable and very secure
When you have the right size of nib selected, they don't move, loosen, fall out, or fatigue your ears, even when moving actively (working out, working, etc)
I mainly bought them to wear while delivering papers to rooms at the hotel I work at, which is a tedious task, but it would often make my previous pair of ear buds fall out, but I found myself using them constantly
The memory foam nibs are fantastic, comfortable, and seal your ear from outside noise for an outstanding acoustic experience
Pros: Excellent sound qualityvery clear highs and lows, strong (but still clear) midswarm soundcomfortableWell constructed - cable quality is nice, and ear buds are solid with no vibrations, rattle, or noiseDetachable cableComes with case, cleaning tool (for the inevitable earwax invasion) and a plethora of ear nibs
nice, gold plated, right angle 3
5mm plugfantastic for planes, trains, road trips, relaxing, jogging/excessive, etcCons: Chord is not braided, just rubber insulated, however it is very robust feeling
would have been nice to have a microphone and/or an inline volume control, but not a deal breaker by any means
Having these headphones in makes you absolutely oblivious to any other sound outside of what you're listening to - it blocks out noise that well
Use with caution, wouldn't recommend for situations when you still need to be able to hear some stuff even with the headphones in, although that's sort of a given
Final thoughts: These are not cheap headphones, and the saying "you get what you pay for" is absolutely true here
Having owned a pair of the beats ear buds (which ironically were half again as much) I can tell you these are a much better product
Comfortable, clear, dynamic sound, and intuitive design
You can't go wrong buying these headphones
I use them with a FiiO  E6 amp because it's Equalizer is much better than my phone's built in equalizer, but an amp is not by any means required
I've used these as in-ear monitors on stage and they are fantastic
Low end comes through solidly and everything else is nice and crisp
I really like how they "disappear" in my ear and is not really visible on stage
The short section of wire just past the driver really helps keep it tucked away and secure
I also used these during studio recording, and they did just fine
At this price range, I couldn't be happier
Booya
This was a present for my boyfriend and he loves it
I would suggest this for the musician in your life
Hard to put in your ear, hard to stay there
Not a good design
Sound quality not as good as previous Shure models
I have been using Shure headphones for my I-Pod for several years now, and this model is the best yet
They deliver an amazingly full, clear sound
Using these headphones, I hear nuances in songs that I never noticed before
The bass sound is incredible
I would highly recommend them
excellent pair of earphones, i did a lot of research (weeks) before i decided to buy these
they were the best i could find for the price
the sound quality is excellent
the bass is strong, maybe a bit muddy, but much clearer then comparable earphones, like bose ie or beats
the trebble might be lacking slightly, but the midrange is crystal clear, a real pleasure to listen to
the quality of the build is great too, with a super long wire that is also very durable (kevlar), and an added benefit that is usually reserved for extreme high end earphones, the wire is removable and can be replaced
its also great at keeping out outside noise
what i did not like was they were not that comfortable and very annoying to get into my ear, required a lot of playing around to get it right
and they hurt my ears after wearing for a while

It took me awhile to get the hang of inserting these in my ears quickly, but after a few days my lack of coordination was resolved
:))  These have very good sound quality, stay inserted (I've never dislodged them or needed to reseat them in the ear), and they do a good job of blocking outside noise
My gym has several obnoxiously loud people, and the SE-215's allowed me to workout in complete bliss
Also, I feel no soreness whatsoever in my ear after a 60-minute workoout
Another brand  used previously was NOT comfortable in hindsight
These IEMs are fantastic
You feel as if you are in the room where the musicians are playing and singing
I had a problem with the audio cutting out on the left earbud after about six months of use
Sent them into Shure for warranty service, got a NEW PAIR of both earbuds in TWO DAYS
Before I knew it, I had a brand new pair of SE535's
Shure's service is the best I have ever encountered
They stand behind their products, and care about their customers
Would not hesitate to do business with them again in the future
I am now a loyal Shure buyer
Not an audiophile but I know cheap earbuds
I've tried many - Sony, Phillips,MEE,Etymotic, Sennheiser, Panasonic, Klipsch and a host of others
For just sit-down listening it was clearly the Klipsch s4
But they are not built to stay and not that great at sound block
For my more active phases the MEE(or something) had the best earpiece that was flexible to mold around your ear and the bud itself was not bad
It stayed there, blocked the ambient sound but didn't sound great
Hey, 2 out of 3 ain't bad
But then came pre-Black Friday (once known as Thanksgiving) and Amazon drops the price of these puppies and  Wallah
I snap them up
These sound a little better to me than the Klipsch, have the same ear bending wire to mold it around the ear as the MEE and the unique way it fits and the cushion just fill the entire ear canal comfortably with the best earbud sound
That;s 3 out of 3 if you don't count the price
Get these if you're limited to $100 or less or wait until next Black Friday
These have been great earphones
Awesome sound quality for the price
They have been sturdy and reliable on the go during my transport to and from work
Different sized ear pieces and carrying case are a nice touch too
We got these as a present for our son, and he loves the noise-canceling that they provide
But the way that they fit over your ear is a little wonky and it took him some time to get used to them
He appreciates how thick and sturdy the cord is
These buds are excellent
I use them predominantly on plane flights both to listen to audio and as ear plugs
They are very comfortable and can easily be left in without fatigue pain for the duration of a long haul flight
Now for the sound
These things are superb, rich sound with excellent bass response
Mid and high range have a calrity that needs not equalization tweaks with your mp3 player
These headphones sound great, and are very good at blocking outside sounds
They're very comfortable also
I have had no issues with them
I do not usually tend to purchase in ear headphones
however I thought I would give it a shot and it was well worth it
This product not only sounds amazing, but they fit great in my ears, (which is usually my problem with earphones) and they come with multiple different attachments to fit different sized ears
I like that the cord goes over the ear so that they stay snug in your ears
They shipped very promptly and I would recommend these to anyone who is a passionate music listener
I ordered a new pair to replace my old black SE215 that I thought I lost
After about a week I noticed that the sound with slightly cutting out; I just thought it was my old iPhone
I tried then on my computer, iPad, and old CD player etc and noticed the sound problems
In the mean time I found my old SE215 so I switched out the cords and that solved the problem
I wanted a replacement cord since I paid for a new set of SE215
I emailed Shure explaining the problem with my included invoice when I purchased them
I get an email to call the service department so I did
Then I get a rude individual named Anthony that says I have go BACK to their website for a form
Then send in the cord AT MY OWN Expense that will not be covered for a defective product
And the cord my not even be covered
I would not recommend any Shure products because their horrible customer service
For a few years, I had been using my old Sony EX71's (which still sound great)
I've wanted to upgrade for a while and have tried various earphones along the way, but none have impressed me
After some online research, I decided to order four pairs of earbuds - the Ultimate Ears UE600 and UE500, Klipsch S4 and the SE215's, with the hope of finding at least one pair that's a keeper
I was looking at the under-$100 price point
The UE500's sounded okay, though the bass was a bit boomy and the highs could be cleaner
They also seem cheaply made and I wouldn't expect them to last
The UE600's are excellent and I may keep them
The balanced armature driver provides amazingly detailed vocals and instrumentals
They don't provide very deep, extended bass, however they do seem to handle lows accurately and are fine for everything but bass-heavy genres like hip hop
After hearing the S4's, I'm surprised that they have such a large following
They sounded very average, with exaggerated, boomy bass and rather harsh (sibilant) highs
Just shows you what one good CNET review and effective marketing can do
For the current price of $59, however, they're worth it if you need some loud earbuds with good sound isolation to use in noisy environments
The last pair I tried were SE215's
To be honest, I wasn't too excited about these, as I expected them to be uncomfortable, with the over-the-ear style and relatively bulky design
But that all changed as soon as I heard them
These are the nicest sounding earbuds I've heard by far
Smooth, balanced, warm, distortion-free sound from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows
And the bass is not only deep, but tight and controlled
I can see the sound of the UE600's or S4's being fatiguing after an hour or so, but the 215's sound so sweet I think I could listen to them all day
While no audiophile, I think I'm pretty picky and I honestly can't come up with any criticism as far as the sound
Shure has been around since the 1920's and has a good reputation, which gives me confidence in the design and engineering that goes into their products
Many of today's trendy brands probably just outsource design and manufacturing overseas and are more about appearance and bling factor, rather than sound quality
I've always had this image of Shure appealing to purists who prefer a totally flat frequency response and who listen mainly to classical music
The SE215 is the first model that has more of a v-shaped curve, with some bass enhancement
The amount of bass is just right - somewhere between flat and extended, as with bass-heavy earbuds
The result is a rich, full sound that is great with all genres of music and which most regular, non-audiophile users will probably prefer
The quality is top notch
There are substantial strain relief moldings at all cord junctions
The cord and plug seem quite rugged and furthermore, the cord is replaceable
The 215's have a 2-year warranty, which is great for earbuds
Six sets of tips are included (3 silicone and 3 foam)
I went with the silicone tips, since I'm too lazy to mess with the compressable tips each time
Putting them on is fairly quick and easy once you get used to it (though slightly less convenient than under ear buds)
They're also very comfortable, once you know how to position them properly
If you wear glasses, there might be some discomfort after a while due to having both the wire sleeve and the arm of the glasses resting on your ears
There are some photos online of people wearing the SE215's incorrectly (left and right sides reversed)
Obviously, using them correctly makes a huge difference in comfort and bass response
The over the ear style helps keep the cord out of the way, where they're less likely to snag on something
The sound isolation is very effective, which means they shouldn't be used anywhere you need to be able to hear
If you're considering these but are hesitating, give them a try
I'm glad I did
I bought these as I read one "In Ear Monitor's comparison chart" in Head-Fi
org and these were among the top (in regards of sound quality) in the sub 100$ price range
I am glad I did that research
Isolation is simply impressive, really helpful when flying
Sound quality out-of-the-box is also outstanding
They are very balanced
I compared them to my full-size Sennheiser HD-595 which I find very detailed and balanced (probably lacking a little bass) and the Shure 215 come close (to my ears) in sound quality
I would recommend them for musicians
This is a design most drummers and other instrument players would appreciate
On the other hand, they may not be comfortable and practical for most people
It takes time to get used to wear these, and also taking them in or out of your ears requires some effort and a few seconds, so I wouldn't recommend them for people who need something easy to remove and put back in quickly
If you are at work and somebody comes to talk to you, these will not come out as easy as many other "earphones" and you will need also to spend some time putting them back in the right way

ie=UTF8&qid=1351535875&sr=8-1&keywords=shure+caseBut I find it good enough for protection purposes
I'm a jaded guy
I've had everything from electrostatic headphones to just about every major brand of earbuds known
I have some Sony sound cancelling headphones that are hard to beat, along with Yamaha earbuds that shine like new money
This set from Shure shames them all
Once you get the right foam tip on the end, and finally get it just right in the ear, the sound experience is unequaled
These buds are just like I like them, bright and flat
The bass is outstanding, not only in range (downward) but in clarity
These buds do not get the least bit 'boomy', which can happen frequently with earbuds
Some manufacturers seem to be overcompensating in the bass department, just because they are earbuds
These buds perform near perfect bass, without any doubling, rattling, or muffling
Quite an accomplishment
The mid range area is really good
Vocals come through with a vibrant clarity I have never experienced before in speakers that fit inside the ear
The only experience I can relate it to is the mid-range horns in my Klipsch Heresy speakers, which absolutely KILL (in a good way) the vocal range
Excellent
(Stuff it Klipsch haters, there is no 'honkiness', it is a figment of your imagination
)The high range is also quite good
High frequency overtone reproduction is so very important for completing the stereo imaging of mid and bass frequencies
This device delivers
You would think it would be impossible to get such high definition bass, mid and high frequencies out of one driver
My hat is off to the engineers at Shure for pulling it off
Even the Yamaha EPH-100 can't quite do it, and they are really good
Overall, I can't believe I waited so long to get a pair of these
Get some for yourself
These may be too good, in a sense, because such quality sound is not really needed in most applications that use earbuds: exercising, casual listening, etc
All I can say is it is better to have the capability and not need it than the opposite
With the Shure earbuds, I can tell if I am listening to a CD or MP3 where I cannot tell when using my JVC buds
You need to decide if you need that much quality
As for me, too much quality is just what I want
The cords are a blessing and a curse
Being super (Kevlar) tough, they are a blessing since they will hardly tear up in normal use
Also, being replaceable is a fantastic option that should be on every pair of $100+ earbuds/phones like all cars have steering wheels
However, the material has to be 'taught' to stay in place
The over-the-ear cords do take some effort to get used to
It is worth the effort, believe me, although YMMV and it is a deal killer for you
Also, I used some Radians earplug material to make myself some custom molded earphones, as many people do nowadays
The experience is 5 times better than with the expanding foam seals
You just will not hear anything from the outside, so driving with them is out of the question
I do use them to do yard work, and listen to my fave MP3's, so even while weed eating, I am listening to music with no interfering noise to speak of
If you are an audiophile that needs some earphones, GET THESE NOW
I received these phones to replace an older pair of Shure sound isolating phones I bought several years ago and loved
This set is probably NOT going to work for most people so I would NOT recommend them (I will be returning them)
First, the plug DOES NOT fit in the jack of an Iphone if you have a case on it - you must REMOVE the Iphone from the case to plug them in which is very annoying
Second, the plugs themselves are difficult to fit into your ear and the cord section right next to the plugs is very stiff which causes the phones to come out of your ears over and over again
The best way to get them to stay in place is to wrap the cord over the top of your ears after inserting the phones and that isn't practical for many people and thus shortens the overall cord length making it inconvenient
Lastly, the phones themselves spin at the entry point into the ear ALSO causing them to come out of your ear if you move the cord
All in all, VERY DISAPPOINTING product
The sounds quality is ok but the other factors - can't plug into Iphone if it has a case, and dont stay in your ears outweigh the usefulness
I used to have a pair of E2Cs
Unfortunately, I lost them
This is the newer version of that product
I have been using a cheap pair of earbuds by another company, and haven't been happy with the sound quality
Luckily, these sound just like me E2Cs
Great low end for earbuds of this price, and a very nice and powerful sound across the full spectrum
You may not have the mids and super-fine details of a more expensive set, but you would be hard-pressed to find something better for this price
The headphones are well-constructed, they come with a great selection of cushions, they have a solid and removable cord, and they fit perfectly in the ears
If you are looking for a great mid-range pair of earbuds, these are a great choice
My music doesn't sound muddled and not "full" anymore
I was a big fan of shure's E2C headphones
Yes, I too was bit by the "one side cutout" issue but their sound was beautiful with great noise reduction
I bought the SE215s as their replacement and must say they are very nice
Sound is great, rich, clear, and balanced
The cord seems sturdy and the ability to replace it is a nice feature (I bought a replacemnt cord just in case)
My only minor issue is the fit - my left ear canal must be slightly larger than my right and the "seal" is not as good on that ear
It does not impact my enjoyment but I find myself adjusting the left side (pushing it back in ear) a little more often than I did with E2Cs
Again, this is minor and I would recommend these
Good sound, good noise isolation
These have plenty of volume and the sound is much better than previous earbuds I have used
Of course this comparison is of earbuds in the $20 range
If your not an audiophile, don't spend the extra money
They will need to last a long time for me to consider them a good value
I looked around for a relatively affordable quality pair of headphones and saw this product reviewed a couple places online
After receiving these I carry them everywhere with me - I'm addicted to the quality of sound they provide and how well they reduce incoming noises from other sources
I use for sound monitoring at home while editing as well as while I'm out listening to Pandora
For me this was a great purchase
I've been using Bose in ear headphones for so long I didn't think there was anything that could be better other than studio headphones
I was wrong way wrong, a friend of mine bought these things and I just so happened to borrow them one day (couldn't find my Bose) and these blew me away
In fact the next day when I returned these to my friend, I told him I bought some on Amazon last night
I simply love them, along with great sound they basically cut you off from the outside world with its sound isolation technology
I thought my Bose were good at that and after using these I realized that Bose didn't do anything but let outside sounds be heard
I also like how the actual speakers separate from the cable so after extensive use they can be replaced
The only downside I have had with these is the over ear part of using them, seems to be hard for them to keep their shape once in your ear
Shure could have done better in my opinion by just keeping it simple with a cable hanging from them
Overall, these are well worth the $100 you will spend to get them, they are far superior to Bose in-ear headphones
If the money isn't a problem to you then these will serve you well
These are literally the best headphones I've owned I have some beats by Dre pro studio headphones but nothing compare to these I am a musician and I played at a big festival and could not hear anything but the tracks playing in my ears
Just to test out how good they block sound while they had music playing before the show started I stood by the speakers with the head phones in and played music from my iPad and all I heard was the music from the iPad playing they are great the best money can by
I just ordered a set of these to replace my old, reliable Shure E3c earphones
Both are over-the-ear earphones
I found the SE215's boomy and lacking in mids and highs, music that sounded live and crisp in my old E3c's sound dead and muffled in the SE215's
I'm returning these and trying the SE315's, instead
The only positive about the new 215s was that (for my ears) the fit of the small black foamies was much, much better than the yellow foamies in the E3c's
Incredible isolation, almost TOO good, if you know what I mean
I could hear my own heartbeat and every step I took translated to a vibration in my ears
Also, the formable wires at the ends of the cords provides an improved fit around the top of my ears than the old E3c's
The 315's seem to share the same physical design, so I hope that the sound quality is better
Oh well, what did I expect
The 215's were half the price of the old E3c's, ten years ago
Why did sure stop at 17kHz
Bass is awesome, mids and voices are phenomenal
Any genre sounds great
EXCEPT the crispness of high hats and cymbals or anything of a high frequency
great separation, soundstage
Seriously
Why not finish the job
The construction is great, the covers are great
the wiring is thick
UGH
They are not my Ultrasone Pro 550, but for $100
The product arived right on time before the weekend
I enjoy the headphone a great deal
The sound is clear and natural but not imposing
Need a little get-use-to to put them on
The are more comfortable than the pair I owned for 5 years until recently
A little bigger than the old pairs (the 3-level)
Sound isolation works as expected
A lot less wire noise than my old pair
The low is not as significant as expected and described by other users
After all it is a 2-level
I bought these for two main reasons: to have good monitors for stage and studio use, as regular ear phones tend to fall out while playing drums
My other reason was to own a good quality and durable set of earphones
These earphones do just that
The interchangeable cable allows me to simply buy a new cable instead of a whole new set, if the cable fails
The design is very good as well
These never, ever fall out of my ears
The audio quality is pretty much perfect
Very crisp high end and a very well-rounded low end
Seems to accurately render my music
The noise cancelling is amazing for flights
Purchase these and you WILL NOT be disappointed
Plus, you get to look cool with clear monitors coming out of the back of your shirt into your ears ;)
This was my solution to a noisy office where people close by talk
Blocks out considerable amount of talking
The white noise that I play sounds great (for white noise)
The part that fits in the ear, right outside the ear canal, is a bit large for my tiny ears
Hurts a little and takes a little while to get them in and out
It's really great, almost the best for about $90-100 headphonesGreat sound quality, comfortable for wearingThe wire for the clear one will become kinda of green
My first impression is that the headphones are great
They have a great mix between lows, mids, and highs
The box they are packaged in is nice and sturdy, but easy to get into
They are without a doubt the best noise isolating headphones I've ever owned
I couldn't hear a thing while listening to my music
I plan on using these as a monitor for playing live drums, and I think they are going to work great for that
I recently purchased a pair of Shure SE 215 earphones after almost two weeks of research into products currently on the market for MP3 listening
Currently, I can say every time I use these 215s, I am totally impressed each time I put them on
My only prior experience with Shure products was in the 1960s,with microphones
They were all I could ask for also
The 215s are as described in several other reviews,they take some getting used to,but are worth the time spent finding the right set up for your ears
I would recommend this product to anyone
Before getting these I had Klipsch Image S4's, which I loved but were not that well built
The headphone jack on them came lose making them useless, after only 7 months of use
The Shure's are much better built, with a strong, thick (but not cumbersome) cord
The heads also swivel on the cable meaning that they don't get tangled
The way you put them on seems weird at first (in, then up, over, and down the back of your ear) but you get used to it quickly, it's very comfortable, and it seems almost impossible that they could fall out
Sound quality seems to be around the same as the Klipsch, but I do think that vocals sound a little crisper, and they tend to emphasis little things (like soft high-hats or piano in the background of a song) that I never noticed with the Klipsch
All in all, they're a great, and I would probably buy from Shure again
The Shure SE 215 earbuds are the best earbuds that i ever bought
I've owned many earbuds, literally, but none like these
I'm new to the "audiophile" world and have not been very experienced with really good headphones but on the price margin I can say that these are the best out there
These buds out perform more expensive earbuds of its price range, especially the Beats by dre, no disrespect or hate intended but these headphones blow it out of the park
The left headphone of the Shure SE-215's just did not work when they arrived
If Shure manages to fix this issue quickly and efficiently, I will let you guys know
I love how they sit flush with my ear and I can use them in bed with out driving the speaker into my eardrum
I agree with other reviewers that the sound cancellation may be too good
By the time I here my wife yelling my name she is already upset
The Shure SE215s are some amazing little headphones for $99
The sound Isolation is above and beyond what I could have ever asked for
even at low I can not hear hardly anything
I have burned these in over the last week and I feel the bass has tightened a bit but still has a nice punch to it
The mids and highs are there but I could ask for more
I want to upgrade to the se535s already as have triple the drivers would really help with sound quality across the board
Understandably these are $99 dollar buds, so for the price these are some of the best bass headphones around
The around the ear design really helps with the isolation and bass reproduction, however it will take a day or two to get used to
As I have had these a little over a week I have put the rounds through these things and can say the durability is very nice
We will see in the next few months if they have problems like a few others have had but as of now I simply cant think of another ear bud in this price range I could recommend over these
All Stats are based on a 1-10 scale
1 bad - 10 amazing
Build Quality:10Comfort:8Lows:9Mids:7Highs:7Soundstage:7Overall sound:8Noise isolation(keeping outside sound out 1= no isolation) :10Sound leakage(sound that comes out into the environment 1= leaks a lot):10Appearance:8Portable:10Value:10
When I first got these iem I was stunned at the lack of bass that they had but after some burn in the bass started to show though
Now if you are looking for deep thick bass look else ware but if you are looking for crisp clean bass these fit the bill very well
With the corect tips these iem can really tune out noise so be careful if out and about
Thes iem are very easy to drive cleanly running on just about any sourse but seem to not gel well with tube amps
For referance other cans I own are ath m40s, grado 325 woody and cable mods, dathbyers
I'll start with the CONCUSIION: Perhaps the best sound available for the money, with one caveat
BUILD: Over the Top
This is professional gear suitable as on-stage in-ear monitors
I've been through 2 sets of Sony headphones whose cables tangle incessantly and short out too quickly
While stiff, these cables appear bullet proof and are replaceable if not
That's great "cable insurance"
Note: I believe a burn-in is necessary as well as the right tip for your ear
I am happy with the foam that came installed
WEAR: Comfortable and will not dislodge, Period
SOUND: (Disclaimer: A true Audiophile avoids the use of a graphic equalization, so I'm disqualified
To my ear, all phones / speakers can be improved by shaping the sound
I'm a semi-pro performing rock/pop drummer
I want some kick in my sound
My Reference Sound: Sony MDR-EX300, Bose QC15, BMW Premium Sound
Main source material for this review: Seal (1994), a very well produced album
With a single driver Sure had to sacrifice some upper and lower end sound, but far less than you might expect
There is a natural "open" sound that is fun to listen to and never harsh
Separation, soundstage and overall articulation are very good
Way better than MDR-EX300 and even the QC15 in most arias
Highs: The super transient highs are rolled off, yes, but only by spending twice the money would I expect improvement
Meanwhile what is there is effortless and pleasing
Mids: Here is where they really shine
Seal's vocals have never sounded better
Usually I need to reduce the mid's with EQ
Not here
No closed or "boxy" sound
Great instrumental sound in this range
Base: Clean, articulate, if lacking what the QC15 offers in the very low end
I have a long low reference base note in Seal's "Bring it On"
It's right at the words "So what lies undone is your Kingdom Come"
The Sure's handled it well enough, though not ground moving
The QC15s are better here
But what more do you expect for the price and seize considering the very good Mids and Highs
I'd say nothing
What is pleasing is the natural mix of all 3, High/Mid/Base
This allowed me to hear new things in songs I've loved for years
That's impressive
THE ONE CON: These baby's need to be "installed" in your ears, not popped in like your standard ear bud
It takes two hands for each ear
This is a lot of fuss just to listen to one song
It takes time and effort compared to anything you've had before
Not a deal breaker, just know this going in
VERDICT: Don't waste your time looking for better sound at this price
Better to waste it instead on the effort "installing" them in your ears
I'm perfectly willing to
Overall, these are good options for sound isolating earphones
I use these in a live church service setting as in ear monitors
The quality is good but have had some problems with crackling in one of them
I have read and believe it could be the connection point between the earbud and the wire
The others work fine
Overall happy with them and work well for our needs
I bought these at an airport kiosk to replace my stock apple ear buds
I primarily bought these for the isolation qualities -- crying babies, jet noise
I don't know what impressed me more, the sound isolation or the sound quality, both are excellent
Another nice feature is that with the sound quality and isolation, you hardly need to turn the volume up
Shure's fitting system is a little hard to adjust to at first, but after a while the cord molds to your ear shape and with practice, the monitors insert in easily
Shure also deserves credit for recognizing the two most likely damaged components of in-the-ear monitors: the ear tips and the cords, can be replaced, thus leavingyour investment in the electronics safe
Poor bass response, not at all worth the price
Was major disappointment vs equivalent Klipsch models
Mos tother reviewers commented on the lack of bass response as well, but understate how bad it is
First impression of unboxing these was the great sound isolation on these, which I wasn't expecting
Sound isolation wasn't even a criteria I was looking for when purchasing a new pair of IEMs
I'll go over a few aspects that made me really like these:Comfort and Fit:  I usually have a hard time with IEMs staying in my ears
A lot of models come with the interchangeable pads, but a lot of times they're just three different sizes
I like that these come with three different sizes in two different materials
I found the harder rubber inserts to fit better without slipping and once you get the right fit and seal, it really does make a difference in sound quality
Lows:  The bass really shine with these headphones
I tried several genres of music and each one had great response
Picked up the rich tones in classical, sufficed great with hard rock and, personally, I think sounded best with folk and R&B with a nice laid back sound
Bass wasn't overpowering though and added to the sound rather than created the sound
Mids:  I found this the weakest part of these headphones with some music
Male vocals sound a bit recessed and guitar a little muddled, but I expect this might open up with some burn in
Compared to my Senn HD600 and AKG K240M, these sounded weak, but that's an unfair comparison
For IEMs these still outperformed a lot of other models and I'm still hoping they'll develop a fuller sound
Having my music on shuffle I got Brighteyes Middleman, which started to change my mind on the mids
Strings and vocals sounded great on these, with vocals taking more of frontstage
Highs:  Not too much to comment on the highs yet
Out of the box they sound pretty good
I find the highs to typically be the most fatiguing for my eyes, but I didn't have a problem with this set
Soundstage:  The sound isolation really helps develop a soundstage for these, which is impressive for a set of IEMs
I expected more of an "in your head" feel to these but found with classical instruments were well placed
For this I listened to Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor and really enjoyed it
Couple other pluses for these were the thicker gauge cable, which make these feel much sturdier than comparable models and the unassuming look which blend in, which is positive if you're not trying to draw attention to your valuables
Overall these seem great and I hope that they get even better with some burn in time
Let me start off by saying, these headphones have pretty much the BEST sound quality you will get from ear buds
They sound just as good, if not better than every pair of over-ear studio headphones I've ever owned
Unlike most ear buds, they are really comfortable
The foam pieces that go in your ear are very soft and didn't cause me any irritation like ear buds normally do
They also have GREAT noise cancellation
These things must be made out of the same stuff they make ear plugs for shooting guns with
NOW
I used these headphones for 3 months and the right ear piece has loose wiring already
I can't get any sound out of it
I used them to listen to music off my iPhone while I walked to class, so it's not like I even needed them to be that durable
These would totally be worth the price if they had lasted me a decent amount of time, but 3 months is pretty bad
The Shure headphones seemed to be good quality but getting them to fit correctly was impossible, we tried all of the different ends that came with the headphones and none were comfortable and the wire that goes over your ear is a real pain
These earphones are a good choice if you prefer:1) good sounding dynamics;2) detachable cable;3) iPhone compatibility (for that you'd need to buy a cable with remote/mic)
I like the sound and build quality of this model
If you buy it together with an iPhone-compatible cable it will be cheaper than Monster Turbine with ControlTalk (140 USD vs
169)
Highly recommended
All I have to say is boom goes the dynamite
And theseEarphones are worth every penny
$100 bucks is nothing  if your looking for earphones for any type of workout
The only reason I had to buy new Shure ear buds was the fact that I left mine in the seat pocket of the airplane
The price is reasonable for the quality of sound you get, the fit, even for my small ear canals, is comfortable, and no ear fatigue
We travel almost every month so they do get a workout and they just keep on going
I researched & tried multiple brands of $100 - 200 priced ear buds (Bose, Sennheiser, etc)
After reading a number of reviews on Amazon and other places, I decided to order the Shure SE215's
They are the best
I would even match them up against over-the-ear headphones from Beats & Bose
They provide excellent highs, mids & lows
And the SE215's have an added bonus of being solid noise-canceling headphones
After couple of etymotic and klipsch and many more i bought these as a second headphone
Oh my god these are super headphones far better than etymotics hf2s and klipsch s4s
The first minute you will hear the difference mid and lows, the isolation
Nice package, cheap looking case
What did i do
I gave these to my brother order 535 right away
To be honest the 535 did not make the same impact as 215s
I will wait
But at 80-90 dollar range you will get best sound, high build quality, tank like durability
Klipsch s4s feels like a joke compare to shure 215 and they are close in the price range
Go and buy them, you won't regret it
I am sorry to say that I am relatively disappointed in these IEM's
I listen almost entirely to heavy/death metal and bought these because I read numerous reviews that they are amazing for this genre, because if you listen to this genre as well you know it is hard to find good headphones for it
Well, these IEM's kind of suck for this genre
In general (for all genres) the bass is weak, if you set an iPod's EQ to hip hop to boost the bass the head phones can't handle it and give that crunchy plastic distorted sound when the bass hits
I compared the same exact songs with the same EQ to the free Apple headphones and those did not distort the bass and sounded much better than the SE-215's
If the EQ was off there was almost no bass presence in any song
The mid's and hi's are pretty good, the hi's don't overkill like most headphones
The build quality is ok, it is very difficult to disconnect the cable from the monitors, which is good, but I'm starting to have the infamous left monitor intermittent connection issue after just a month of owning them
The audio connector is way too huge, you can't use it with about 95% of iPhone cases
The sound isolation really is amazing, I don't use the foam tips included because they are impossible to take off and you pretty much have to destroy them to take them off, but the silicon ones are just as good at sound isolation
The chord is about 3 ft too long, and the memory wire near the monitors is just way too stiff and makes it difficult, even when formed to your ears, to keep the buds from pivoting about the bud and sticking out of your ear
The cable construction is very good, I feel confident they won't break because of frayed wires
But I have also tested these with hip hop, pop, dubstep, techno and rock
And really they don't sound that good, they are pretty much on the same level, if not lower than the free Apple headphones just with a moreComfortable fit and significantly more inconvenience
I will say that if you listen mainly to acoustic music, with no bass, then these are the headphones for you
I really wish I could return these now
I'll probably sell them and buy the Klipsch S4's or whatever that everyone recommends
Shure SE SE215-K - Single Dynamic MicroDriver Sound Isolating In Ear Earphones, BlackThese earphones are well built with a rugged construction
The cord is thick and does not get tangled
They have a secure fit
They fit in the ear
the cord wraps around the ear and then you can tighten the cord behind you head
That makes them great for exercising and running
The one short coming is that they have absolutely no bass
Update 12-20-13 Shure has excellent customer service
I had the ear buds about 14 months when the cord broke
They came with a 2 year warranty
I mailed the damaged ear buds to Shure and received a brand new pair within two weeks
Thanks Shure
Oh my stars
Suddenly I'm hearing sounds I've never heard before, even on songs I've enjoyed for years
I can only compare these to cheaper models
I am not a musician and would not spend $200 on earbuds
I did need to replace the foam tips that came on them (I ruined them taking them off) but the buds come with an assortment of tip sizes
The buds are curved to fit inside your ear and the cord goes up and behind your ear
After a few times wearing, the cord sort of molds to the shape of your ear and the buds are easier to place
The "up and over the ear" may take a bit of getting used to, but hey, it's all what you're used to and these are worth getting used to
I own these earbuds and i need to say that these are the best earbuds i have ever heard
About the isolation-The earbuds are so isolating when you first use them you cannot hear anything or anyone when you put your ipod at 25% power
If you think that you could go on a jog with these be careful cause you will not  hear a thing
After a while I need to take out the earbuds because it can get uncomfortable hearing nothing from the outside world
Also when you play the music it will feel like the music is coming strait from your brain
Sound Quality-The treble is nicely represented, not to harsh and not to rolled off
The mids are brilliant but when i first used them i thought that the vocals sounded a little quiet on these but i find that after a month or two these earbuds break in and everything sounds beautiful
Now my favorite part, the bass
I love the bass on these
I have the ATH-M50 and those sound great but sometimes id like a little more boom to my bass, and these earbuds do a fantastic job of delivering bass (Its not annoyingly bassy, but I find it to be just right)
Another note-When I was looking for earbuds i had to choose between these the soul by luda, and the beats
These earbuds are made for ADULTS and not some fancy pantsy rapper
Dont get the cool looking pieces of plastic because they look cool, save your money and get something that will sound better- PLEASE
Anyways if your looking for a sub 150$ headphone than look no further because i cannot recommend this headphone enough
When I first got these, I used the memory-foam-type ear tips and was really disappointed with the results
Extremely bass-y and muffled (to my taste), making Pink Floyd's The Wall almost unlistenable
But when I used the included soft-rubber flange-y ear tips, it was 100% better
Generally well-balanced; perhaps a little less high-end shimmer than my previous Etymotics ER6s, but better bass, more solid construction, and better fit
Regarding the latter, I am one of those who likes to listen to music as I'm going to sleep, and fortunately, these work pretty well in that regard - they're comfortable enough and low-profile enough that you can lie on your side on a pillow with them in and they are comfortable enough to fall asleep with
Not perfect- still just a _little_ too stick-y out-y, but better than any of the many other earbuds I've tried, including ones that I had Ultimate-Ears-style ear molds made for
For working out, they're a little fussy to get in, but once in, they stay in very well
As others have noted, the wires go up, around and behind your ears; doesn't bother me, but I suppose YMMV
Anyway, four stars, since I think the sound (especially the high end) could be a little cleaner (but then, that's why Shure makes higher-end earbuds, right
), but solid, comfortable and durable
I'm pleased
I frequently use these earphones, as I'm out and about every day
They're great for having on the subway and they cancel noise out way better than the Bose
I often miss my stop on the train, because I can't hear the voice announcing the stop, and I don't listen that loud
The inserts mold perfectly to my ear and are more comfortable than the Bose
Also, I had a previous pair of Bose break due to my cat biting them
She bit right through the speaker on her first try
She's also gotten a hold of these, but the speak is protected by a hard plastic barrier due to the construction on the ear bud, so she can't bit through it, unless she has it for awhile perhaps
Solid in ears
First pair
I have a hd650 with audinst hudmx dac to compare and it obv doesn't measure up but very good in its own right
Durable, good design, great for day to day use
Good isolation
I use it with Comply Tx-100 Foam Tips 3-Pair Pack, Medium (Black) to prevent earwax/debris from getting in
BIG TIP: realized this late
My foam tips kept breaking before since I just stuffed them in my ear but I learned you HAVE to squeeze them down all around and let them inflate in your ear
That way they do not break as easily
Maybe not obvious to everyone lol
I've owned several sets of on-ear noise cancelling headphones from Sennheiser over the last several years, but decided to try these in-ear Shure SE215s at the recommendation from an online review site
Wow
Wow
The sound isolation from these headphones is simply incredible
Noises from planes, office environments, mowing grass, etc
are almost completely blocked out
The incredible thing about this isolation is that I now hear musical passages and sounds that I would never have heard in these noisy environments from a portable set of headphones
As an added benefit, there is no active circuitry, so batteries are a thing of the past
The sound quality of these are amazing as well
I've paid more than twice as much for over-the-ear cans and honestly have a hard time finding much difference in the sound from these portables
There is a slight over-emphasis in the mid bass that I sometimes have to tame with the free Denon EQ/Audio app that I typically use, but the rest of the spectrum is top notch, especially for the price
If I wanted to spend more, I've no doubt that the sound quality would only get better the SE315s or 415s
I am pleased with the comfort of these as well
It took a little time to adjust to the feel of a set of in-ear headphones since I was coming from years of on-ear portables
I tried all of the supplied pads and settled on the medium foam set
I can wear these continuosly for 5-6 hours if needed, so transcontinental flights are a breeze
Sleeping in these is much easier than before as well
They are much less obtrusive than on-ear phones and the sound volume can be very low because of the high isolation
Construction seems to be good as well
I have seen other reviews regarding one or the other cable giving problems, but I haven't had these problems and I have used them outside, exposing them to sweat and numerous cable snags
Having the ability to replace the entire cable assembly for roughly $30 is a nice plus too
In short I'm very happy with these headphones
The fact that these sound so good, yet are so small and portable is amazing to me
If you have a discerning ear and might find the need for occasional EQ on some recordings to be a nusiance, you might want to spend more and go for the SE315s
If you are like me and don't want to spend more than $100 on a set of portable headphones that might get lost, stolen, or otherwise damaged, then look no further
Pros:-Noise isolation is amazing-Sound quality is impressive for price-Comfort is very good, 5+ hours is easy, and sleep is also possible
Cons:-Mid-bass might be too heavy for some, can be tamed with a little EQ
Better than Beats, better than Bose
These have the best sound
I use these for tracking, I'm a drummer and they are great while playing
This item shipped quick too
Love my In Ears
Let me start off by saying these are the BEST earphones I have ever tried
The sound quality rivals headphones such as the M-50 and porta pros and surpasses beats and bose
The only thing holding it back is its disgusting durability
I have had these for less than a month and the left ear is already breaking
I put down $120 on these earphones and I am EXTREMELY disappointed at this
The sound quality was great and I was considering replacing my over ear headphones with these, however, given that these broke, I can't
DO NOT BUY THESE EARPHONES
When I read that the left earphone breaks from other review I unfortunately didn't believe it
Believe every review that says the left earphone breaks
This is absolutely unacceptable
The fact that IPOD headphones last longer than this says something
UPDATE1 Star
I owned it for a year and my fourth pair broke
I paid nearly 50 dollars for returns
Stay away
I love these earbuds, they work so well with music and keeping outside noise out, people who want me literally have to come poke me because I don't hear them
These particular earbuds are very good for commuting or jogging or whatever vigorous activity you may be engaged in because of the way they fit in and over your ears
They also provide very good sound as far as bass,highs,lows and midrange
Would definitely recommend them
I didn't want to spend the money on headphones but I realize, you have to
After trying some TDK's and Logitec Ultimate earbuds both disappointing in quality, I knew I had to expand the price range, I already knew what company to choose from, "Shure"
These did not only sound better but the cord and plug is built thicker and made to last longer
Make sure you know how these fit before you buy, they didn't take long to get use to and I enjoy the fit like any other
Great product, I can't imagine anyone rating low on a Shure headphone that is not defective
These headphones 1) have great audio quality, I am always hearing details music that I never hear on my 5
1 THX audio system at home and 2) The sound isolating works incredibly well for me with the foam earbuds (included)
I can be in a room of people talking and literally hear nothing
My friends will make fun of me and yell my name and say foolish things about me, and I have never noticed until they wave their hands in front of my face
Great headphones for getting in the zone for computer work
I had Klipsch Image S4i's before these and these Shure blow them away
I'm using the smallest plug and it still seems too big
This hanging over your ears is a joke
Can't be done
Wires are too long, so it's hard to get a good seal to block out other sounds
Upgraded from my 8yr old Shure pair and was getting sick of the pairs that came with my phones
Definitely an improvement over their old model, my ears fit into either the medium or large gel inserts, which leads me to believe that as long as u relatively have no trouble with other in-ear buds these WILL fit snug
Deifnitely the build and sound quality I'd expect from Shure
Price 4/5Treble 5/5Bass 5/5Comfort 4/5Build Quality 5/5Aesthetics & extras 5/5
I would classify my self as an audiophile
I have a Mcintosh amp and B&W 803D Speakers as my main listening environment
I would say these are a little light in the bass department for my liking the highs were crisp bu not over powering
I would say these are very good for the money
I have there predisesors and have used them for years
the E2c
I can not report any issues with this headset
I would like more clear highs and some more deep bass but given the drive configuration of these they are very good
I would buy them again
Ok this review is based on out the box with no burn in time
I used a Cowon J3 with mp3s @ 320kbps and FLAC
Types were jazz, rock, r&b , old school hip hop,  reggae, and blues
Have other types of music but this is all I tested
This is the best overall sounding IEM I have ever heard
My other IEMs have been MEElectronics a151 , MEElectronics sp51, Denon AH-C710k , Denon AH-C452K , Phillips SHE-8500 , and Altec Lansing UHP336
They take a little getting used to getting into the ear the first time
After that it gets easier
Bass: Clean for the most part
Only get a little muddy on song where the studio tried to pump up the bass more than it should have
Mids: clean and warmHighs: it's there but doesn't hurt your ears
These are also fun sounding
Not sure if that is a real thing but that's how I will describe them
I have not tried to take the cable off as I think only reason to do that is when it needs to be replaced
These were my first "sound-isolating" headphones, and I wish I had fully appreciated the meaning of that
They are, in essence, earplugs with a hole through which sound is piped
I found them awkward to put on due to their "over-ear" fit, uncomfortable to continue wearing, and bothersome to pop out when somebody wanted to talk to me
These are headphones to wear for the long haul -- a walk, a workout, or uninterrupted tasks
I had no complaints about the sound quality, but coming from Bose IE headphones, the bass seemed quite light in comparison, and the sensation of sealing off my ears did not add to the experience
Finally, after less than a week of usage, the left channel cut out -- but only when connected to my iPod
Apple products do seem to be pickier when it comes to connectivity and power chargers, but that's not much of an excuse
Other headphones work fine with the iPod, and the Shure headphones work with other devices
I was disappointed with this product
The reviews were promising and they looked very cool, but they are not the answer for my needs
I've since purchased a pair of Bose IE2s and I am much, much happier
Just received the headphones yesterday and tried them out immediately
Well first I got to say these headphones sound great
Awesome sound and deep lows, which should be expected out of a set of good quality monitoring headphones that cost this much
My only complaints are that the earphones don't fit exactly in the inner ear unless you have them just right
So you have to mess with them a little until you find the right position for your ear
If you don't have them positioned correctly, the sound is awful and you won't be impressed at all
The other complaint is the price
There are so many monitoring style earphones out on the market today that are much lower but I'd imagine the sound quality would not be as great
Well, just for the record, this is not exactly true
I also bought a set of MEElectronics M6-BK for around $20
These headphones sound almost as good, for just a 1/4 of the price
If I would have known this before, I might not have purchased the Shure earphones
Although I'm a little remorseful for purchasing these Shure headphones at this price, I'm not dis-satisfied about the sound and quality
The biggest difference you'll see upfront between the Shure and other earphones (in the lower price range) is the quality of the build
The Shure has heavy duty wiring (lined with Kevlar) and gold connections, where the $20 headphones do not
So in short, the Shure earphones are a good buy if money is not a major deal breaker
I had an older pair of Shure earphones, the E2C I think
They were great until the cables got slammed in the door, exposing the wiring, and had to be replaced
I bought some Klipsch ones based on excellent reviews, but I hated them in comparison to my old Shures
The Klipsch ones got stolen (good luck with those awful earphones sucker
)  I couldn't find the E2Cs, but these seemed comparable--Shure earphones for around $100
These are great, maybe better than the E2Cs
They are "noise-cancelling" in the way that they fill up your ear canal with a tight seal--great for airplanes, etc
without the big-old active noise cancelling devices
Seriously, I've had people talking to me and I can't hear a word until I remove them
Great sound reproduction, especially deep bass
I love them
If I had to pick a downside, they are a bit bulkier than say the stock iPod pieces of trash, but these are fine for running, working out, etc
I wouldn't cycle with them just because you wouldn't be able to hear any upcoming cars or other road hazards
Another good thing about these--if you work out hard and sweat like I do, you build up earwax in the canal of the earphone
These come with a special wire-loop device specifically built for cleaning that out
Keep up the good work Shure
So the Shure SE215 Blacks are my 3rd pair of earphones over $50
00 that I've purchased in the last year
Prior to the Shure's I had the Klipsch S4i's and the Beats Tour HD
Without a doubt the Shure's beat both sets
The Klipsch had a poor fit for me and lasted about 4 months
The strain reliefs weren't very good and eventually I lost signal in the right channel
In comparison, the Shure's are designed in the professional monitor way and the strain on cables stops at the top of the ear instead of at the hub
Additionally having a replaceable cable helps too
The Beats Tour HD's were a disaster, especially for 150 bucks
They also had poor fit and the although the ribbon cable was interesting, it wasn't very sturdy and quickly sustained a tear through the rubber
The right channel on these also went out in less than 4 months
As far as fit goes for the Shure's, these actually are designed to fit in the ear comfortably and the foam cushions seal up really well
It takes a minute to get used to the cables going over the ears
The sound is tough to qualify
Its for sure less punchy that the Beats but that is to be expected
I'm using an iPod Touch 4th gen and tried both the standard music player program and EQu with a customized equalizer setup
The standard music player emphasizes the base alot
Using a custom equalizer setup, you can dial down the bass a bit and bring out the mid's and highs
The Shure's sound great after some tweaking
Overall I would definitely recommend these monitors over the Klipsch's and Beats at the price range
I'll start with the most important thing: yeah, these sound really, really good
Highs and mids are clear and distinct
Layers of sound appear that you just can't hear with stock earbuds
The bass rumbles, thumps, rolls and menaces when it should
I've had various pairs of Etymotics, Sennheisers, and Ultimate Ears at this price point, and these destroy them all - especially for bass
On tracks like "Also Sprach Zarathustra" and "Harder Better Faster Stronger," these earbuds will move you
They come with plenty of extra tips, a cleaning tool, and a really nice case
The cord is detachable and replaceable - a very nice touch, considering how often the cord fails on earbuds
The one downside is the over-the-ear cable, which is a little annoying, but you'll get used to it
I've never tried serious IEMs before
These ones are nice
Sit comfortable, cable noise is rarely heard
I wear them with cables around the ears, as the instruction suggests--probably it's *the* way to wear IEMs, not sure
A few different molds are included, and I think I've found ones fitting
The construction seems to be solid, I don't think I'll accidentally break the cable (as it happened before with cheaper in-ear phones)
Some time is required to put the phones on or off, but I think I'll get used to it
However, it would be better if the part of cable that goes around the ear bent a bit more
I like the sound, bass is not too much but enough
Probably a bit lacking in high frequencies, but of course that's just me after Beyerdynamic cans that maybe have an excess of those
Also, I don't know how IEMs should or can sound like, so my opinion isn't really relevant here
I like that I can listen to music on pretty low levels even in a street noise, but it's dangerous in that you may not hear a car driving right behind you
I fully agree with SK
Although this headset has great sound and isolation it is not able to be fully realized because the plugs are painful to the concha of the ear
It's difficult to listen to an entire album in one sitting because of the acute pain inflicted by the earphones that are much too wide and too deep
The awkward, heavy, inflexible cables don't lay well over the outside earlobe either
I'm not so wild about sound quality that I will tolerate the poor fit of these headphones -- so I say back to the drawing board, Shure
Coming from 3 year old Shure SCL3's, I already had high hopes of build quality as well as musical quality coming from the SE215's
One thing that initially got to me was the different form factor which does take getting used to (mainly because the SCL3's were simple "straight into ear canal")
Also it might be because of the shape of my ears or size of ear canal but the seal with these don't seem to be as tight as compared to the SE215's even though I use the yellow foam inserts for both of them
Lastly, I'm not much of an audiophile but these definitely have much more bass than I'm actually used to but for the genres that I listen to this is more than welcome
The only gripe that I have so far is the type/quality of the carrying case that comes with it
My previous Shure case was a hard case which I appreciated since it kept the foam inserts intact while this one is fairly soft which allows the foam to be compressed (basically defeats the purpose of having the foam inserts if they're already pre-compressed when you take them out)
better sound than the bose one
I bought it for my husband and he was pretty happy about the sound quarity
I love music, no I really do
If I thought I could've made money at it I would have jumped at the chance
So I need pretty good ear-buds
I'm not rich or anything close to it
So 2, 3 or 4 hundred dollars for ear-buds is more than I want to spend
But I've had a few (last being SIEGE)and they always broke in a shorter time than expected
I'm not hard on them by any means, but I use them everyday to hold off the sounds of the world I live in
I NEED good/great sound
A comfortable fit and ease of use
Outside of that if they looked great it a plus
These SHURE SE215's are all that and more
Afterwards I bought from Amazon the interchangeable IPod cable
Pros: The sound is like being there (I've heard things I didn't here on my considerable home system
Price $100
00 I bought them outside of Amazon from a dealer close by (that would honor a return if needed)  They look extra cool to me in my ears and in my hand
They are clear and stand out because of it
The construction is soo much better than anything I've used, it's incredible
The cable can be disconnected if damaged or in my case upgraded to one with an IPod controller and on cord Mic
++ They block 95% of the the external sounds around you
Cons: Getting them in correctly took some practice
They go in upside down from the way they look (like stage musicians wear them)and the cords go OVER your ears and in back
Getting the correct bud will take trail and error
-- They block 95% of the the external sounds around you
Some people will feels really vulnerable when are disconnected from their surroundings
Verdict- Where have they been all my life
I think I will get this brand of ear-buds from now on
They seem built to last and they sound wonderful
Nuff said
I've been a dedicated SHURE listener for several years
My most recent pair was the SE210
Unfortunately they finally fell apart so I decided to upgrade to the 215s
Sadly, almost everything I love about the 210s has been changed for the worse with the 215s
The biggest reason I fell in love with SHURE at first listen many years ago was the clear articulation of every instrument and voice in my music
Every strum of the guitar, every vocal overtone, every snap of the snare drum was perfectly and crisply rendered
WOW
Now that's a sound worth paying some money for
It was easy to fall in love with that perfection
But with the 215s, all of a sudden, that crispness is gone
the individual articulation is muddied - the tones, once separate and distinctly recognizable, now bleed into and over each other
this is what I bought SHURE to get away from
Turns out that in the 210s, Shure used a Balanced Armature design for the micro-speaker
In the 215s they decided to go with a Dynamic Microdriver design
I don't know anything more about those two designs than this: one produces beautiful, articulate sound, and the other is sloppy, indiscriminate, and uninspiring
This is a HUGE step down in quality
Another reason I loved Shure on first listen is that they didn't blast me with extra bass
Their bass was solid, deep, and expressive, but never over-amped nor overbearing
This too has changed with the 215s; the bass is just overblown now and I had no other choice but to choose the "Bass Reducer" profile in my ipod EQ
I found that getting a secure fit with the earbuds was much more difficult with the 215s as well
Sadly, that was the least of my worries
After a few days I just couldn't stand it
I wanted to love the 215s, but I had to return them
What a HUGE disappointment
7 months old, treat them like crud, and they sound as good as the day i bought them
I think i bought a lucky pair as many people had them short out
Lucky me
I recommend them to bass lovers and people who find treble irritating (very smooth sounding headphones)Decent sound stage and great bass response
The noise is also locked in so you can listen without bothering others
Highly recommended
These Shure SE215-K are my first "real" headphones
I have been using skullcandy for a few years, and have been plagued with failures, they die within 6 months
I decided to pay $100 for quality instead of $50 for junk
I am very pleased with the quality and comfort of these Shure 215'sI often travel on noisy airplanes, these are very effective in blocking out ambient noise, so you can enjoy your music
The way these block out background noise is also great in my workplace, however if you need to be aware of what's going on around you, these may block out too much noise
These are comfortable, and appear to be reliable, time will tell how they hold up
I have had them for several weeks, and I am very pleased so far
I have been using the Shure earbuds for about 2 months now
I swear by them
They really have the best quality for their price
I was hesitant to purchase based on some of the other reviews and I have experienced some of the issues
If your sound is tinny, you need to find the appropriate sized ear buds
I have rather large canals and need to use the largest foam ones to create a perfect seal
Not only does this help block out sound, but it is also required to get the full sound effect
When I tried to use the smaller silicone earbuds, They sounded tinny and had extremely low volume
My cables have been working like a champ without any issue and they are my daily use earbuds
Great bass and sound details and superior fit/feel and sound isolation
The ability to remove the buds from the cable is a nifty feature is case of damage but the wire feels pretty robust so I doubt that'll happen during everyday use
In short, these earbuds are easily the best headphones I ever bought
I'm happy with this purchase
I had a pair Of E2C's that were given to me as a demo from Shure years ago and I wore them to the point of the rubber around the cable coming off and the wire breaking inside the cord jacketing causing the sound to go in and out
Having a background in the audio business for many years and very particular about performance i was more then apprehensive about a new pair of IEM's living up to my standards
Im one of these guys who always says "They don't make them like they used to"  But Wow the SE215's are AWESOME
I opened the zipper case and at first glance I immediately noticed Shure has fixed the part of the cord that touches the top of my ear by using a small piece of flexible tubing around the cord and a piece of metal or like substance to hold the form of the top of the ear
Shure also made the ear bud swivel and detach so the cables can be replaced if at some point I manage to wear these out as well
Next on to the Listening, I have to say the sound out of the box was thin and lackluster
Not what you would expect from Shure
After reading some helpful reviews about IEM's having a break in period I decided to give it a shot and run them over night on my Ipod at medium volume
To my surprise the next morning the sound had completely changed
Wow what a difference
Shure didn't let me down after all
These sound better then the old E2C's
Bottom line for only 99$ buy you a set of SE215's,  give them a little break in over night and then experience what your music is supposed to sound like
Thanks Shure I am a customer for Life
These are my third pair of Shure earphones
All three have broken within 6 months
I though that spending a little more on the SE215 would lead to improved durability, but they crapped out even more quickly than the SE115
DO NOT BUY SURE PRODUCTS
I've purchased dozens of earphones and earbuds for under $100 over the years
(I reserve the big bucks for speakers and electronics
)  Starting with Koss and Superex headphones, I've ended up happy with Grado's
But up until recently it's been harder to find earbuds that are wearable, great-sounding, AND that I could afford to lose at the gym or on vacation
So my wife and I have been using some version of Sony's MDR-EX series for years now, and been satisfied with them
But with quality earbuds finally catching on, there are a lot more brands and models to choose from
So with the destruction of my last set of earbuds and the arrival of the value-priced Shure SE215, it was time to give Shure a try
Thankfully, there were no nasty surprises
In fact, I think the reviews are pretty accurate overall
Thankfully I've had no problem with intermittent connections at the earpiece as reported by a couple of reviewers
The SE215 earbuds are quality made, and appear quite rugged
Hopefully they'll last for many years, at least as long as the much cheaper Sony's have
The selection of rubber and foam earpiece "sleeves" provide a good range of fit to choose from
I expected to prefer the foam, which does fit easily and snugly, with excellent sound isolation
But perhaps a little too snugly for me, resulting in long term fit-fatigue
I'm trying out the standard rubber sleeves now; so far so good
The way these fit over and in the ears is unusual, but very effective
They retain their place AND seal even when moving around or exercising
They take 2-3 times longer to insert in your ears than standard earbuds, so don't purchase these if you have to remove your earbuds often for any reason
Since the cable goes over the ear, cable noise is very low, but not completely gone
Sound quality is very important to me
I want the best of both worlds; realistic, natural sound AND knock-my-socks-off "great-sounding" performance
Usually you can't have both in one product, especially transducers
What the SE215's provide is more of the former; a mostly flat response with no people-pleasing-peaks
As a result, your emotional and/or intellectual involvement will be wholly dependent on the music and production values
This is as it should be anyway
As mentioned by other reviewers, there is no lack of bass
It is quite solid, with plenty of kick when called for, but without bloat
I wouldn't recommend them as "bass-lover" models; they just aren't bass-shy
Male vocals can be a little warm, but not unpleasantly so
Mid-range is natural and clear, just like I want it
Due to a slight hearing loss I am not a great judge of high-frequencies
But to me these sound a little rolled-off in the region I CAN hear
This was easily corrected by a slight amount of EQ above 6KHz
(It may also be that I've become accustomed to earbuds with too much high end
)I am especially gratified to know that an American company like Shure has survived from 1925 well into the digital age
Shure is still making fine products at reasonable prices
There is just no way to avoid those analog transducers, right
Let me start off by stating that I do not consider my self an audiophile
I just have a particular sound signature that I like
I like some bass (leaning toward accurate, not overly enhanced) with nice full warm mids and non-sibilant highs
I HATE sibilance
I can now say that the SE215-K Fit the bill perfectly for me
This was initially a rocky road for me
I found these to be extraordinarily uncomfortable for me and none of the supplied sleeves would seal properly for me
I tried the Comply brand sleeves and still no joy
Swallowing and side to side movements would break seal compromising sound
Next I tried the tri-flanged sleeves from Shure
Dear God I thought I was driving a 2 penny nail into my skull
The sound improved dramatically for the five minutes I could tolerate them
With the knowledge that I would never use these sleeves unless I felt a had to do a penance for some horrible wrong I had done, I went ahead and cut off the the first (smallest) flange with an Xacto knife, then braced myself and proceeded to jam these things into my ear
To my surprise all discomfort was gone, the seal was solid regardless of my heads position or what my jaw was doing
The next couple of days entailed me getting used to the idea that these where firmly in place and where not going to fall out
I found myself constantly checking the fit
The third day I could finally concentrate on the sound
I was quite impressed
I could make out different instruments in my Dave Matthews tunes that I could never distinguish before and Florence's ( of Florence + the Machine )voice was so warm and powerful and distinguished I was simply floored
One month of nightly listening and the sound has improved in regards to being able to distinguish instruments and the like
I actually fall asleep and lay on my side with these on every night
So far none of that dreaded noise cut off others experience from the wire connector
I find its much more stable to tighten the wires under the chin rather than behind the head
Had my initial journey in getting a proper fitting sleeve for these things not have been so arduous I may have given it 5 stars
I'm very happy I didn't give up on them and return them
I'm so pleased I may upgrade to one of there higher end models when these wear out
(If I can get passed the significantly higher price tag) Would I recommend these to my friends
Yes, with a caveat on finding the right fitting sleeves, Since I have all these extra lying about I would let them try before they buy
Have a Great One
Erik
the SE215 is a slight improvement to the already fantastic previous generation of the same earphones
I had the last pair for four years until my cat chewed it up
These earphones are durable, and sound amazing
They satisfy all my classical music needs
Buy them
Let me start off saying that for price on Amazon, the Klipsch headphones are a great buy
I have owned them for about 6 months before they started shorting out
Im not sure if it was the headphones themselves but I tend to run through earbuds rather quickly
That let start the direct comparison
Comfort:I would have to give a slight edge to the Klipsch headphones over the Shures here
The Klipsch soft ear sleeves just slide in but there is a pro and con to everything
The Shure's use a foam tip that expands in your ear
It creates a much better seal and therefore has better noise-isolation then the S4's
My ear sometimes feels a little discomfort after wearing them for a while but i may just need to switch the smaller sleeves they provide
Secure Fit:The SE215 has the clear advantage hear
The headphones are tricky to learn to get in but once you do the very nature of how the sit in the ear makes them much more secure
The headphone cord comes forward then loops over and behind the ear
Tugging on the cord rarely budges these things
Meanwhile, I have had problems with the S4's coming out, especially if I'm working out
Ease of use:The S4's have the edge here
You simply push them in
The SE215's require to roll the foam tips before you put them in to get the best seal and to loop the cord over your ear
that can be annoying if they fall out while running
That said they much less likely to fall out
The S4's have alternate of putting them in that involves looping the cord as well but i found it to be uncomfortable
Noise-isolation:Advantage goes the SE215s for the reasons mentioned before, the foam tips
Construction:Both seem well constructed
The SE215 feels more substantial and the cord is much thicker
It seems less prone to tangling
Performance:As i wrote this I listened to the same song once with each pair with the same EQ and volume settings
The SE215 were louder and sounded cleaner for the same songs and settings
The bass was deep and the highs were clear
The S4's are no slouch either
They outperform most other sub-$100 earbuds out there
Bottom line:Both are a great set of the headphones
The SE215's are $100 and the S4's are $60
Do the Shure's justify the extra $40
yes
but its all personal preference
The S4's are a steal for $60
That said I really appreciate the superior performance, fit, and noise-isolation
I expected to love these IEM's based on all the rave reviews out there and my previous experience with Shure phono cartridges and microphones
Unfortunately, I found them quite uncomfortable, and their housings had a tendency to fall out of my ears
None of the supplied tips seemed to seal well with my ear canals, resulting in weak bass response
The black-colored foam tips are extremely soft, and they take a long time to expand again once compressed
The rubbery tips are more manageable but did not seal well
This fact combined with the stiff cords looped over the back of my ears caused these IEM's to fall out regularly
Plus, they take several seconds longer to get situated in your ears compared to normal (i
e
non-IEM style) earbuds
IMO, the Monster Turbines and NuForce NE-700X earphones are superior sounding for less money and provide superior comfort than Shure's SE-215, which I have returned
i have always loved Shure headphones
However this latest purchase i am still not sure about
I love the sound but i am not to excited about the fit of the headphones
i am still trying to get used to the cord going up around the ear
It might just take a little time
I'm on my third pair of Shure earphones -- the latest iteration of the offering priced between $100 and $200
(They change model numbers more often than my son changes his socks
)  Bought pairs 2 and 3 through, but not from, Amazon
Shure as s---, they seem to crap out around two years, the length of the warranty period
They sound good, though, and they stay in the ear when exercising
Excelentes headphones, usarlos es absolutamente adictivo porque (en la medida que la fuente de sonido sea de buena calidad) se escucha TODO lo que hay para escuchar
Son bastante aislantes del ruido exterior, al punto de generar cierta desconección de lo que pasa afuera
Definitivamente los mejores headphones que he tenido
I am a drummer, I have used SEVERAL "In Ear" and "Over Ear" headphones
For the money these are by far the best that I have purchased
Bought to replace a pair of the Beats Tour earbuds that had to be replaced under warranty TWICE before I owned them 6 months
Please, don't let my lack of judgement then affect my credibility for this review
I have erred
To err is human
these Shure SE-215 earphones, however, are divine
Construction: The wiring is a little heavier-duty than I expected, with robust connections at the joints
Would imagine that it'd take quite a bit of roughhousing/abuse to cause a failure - I expect no problems here
The actual driver construction seems strong enough - I can see the glue joints on the plastic enclosure, but I cannot feel any seam
Materials: Again, the wiring seems rather robust, although I'd have preferred a slightly less tacky insulating material used as they tend drag a little bit
The driver enclosures seem to be built of a pretty robust plastic
I opted for the clear ones, which don't necessarily look rock-solid, but I imagine its just a case of being able to see the little bits and pieces that makes them seem less than they are
Sound: Everything sounds crisp - I listen to just about everything through them (crappy brostep through Wu-Tang Clan through Dave Matthews), and the quality of the reproduction is more than great
There seems to be no over-emphasis on specific tonal ranges (unlike my prior Beats), and there seems to be ample range across the entire
the lows hit low, the highs hit high, and everything just sounds smooth
Kinda sucks, but I'm gonna have to get rid of some of my 128 kbit/s files - I can noticeably hear the squishy cymbals and muffled bass now
They also tend to isolate external noise very well too, especially with the foam ear sleeves
Fit: Comes with a variety of different ear sleeves and sizes
I'm a big fan of the "memory foam" type
The over-ear part contains a piece of paper clip type wire that is bent to adjust the fit and feel; I have mixed feelings toward this because its simply too pliable - it seems that every time I take them off and put them back on, I have to re-adjust the fit to keep them right
Unfortunately, that's gonna be responsible for 4-stars instead of 5
I would love to see a more robust metal wire that doesn't bend and flex so easily
Even better, I'd love to see a hardened sleeve material over the ears that can be heated with a hairdryer to shape and retain rigidity when cooled
Wishful thinking
whatevs
Features: I'm a huge fan of the attachment point between the wiring and the driver - I've owned too many earphones/earbuds over time that I've had to replace because the connection between the two was broken
If such a tragedy occurs here, you're telling me that I can simply buy a new wire and plug it into the driver and have it work
Sold
Overall: I love them
They sound great, the feel great, they fit great
They fit comfortably and snugly under my motorcycle helmet, and I can actually hear my music too
All in all, I STRONGLY recommend these
Simply to explain; Perfect
amazing bass and sound details,its name is correct; realty a live sound monitor
It will satisfy all your expectation from a headphone below 200 bugs
good sound isolationvery good material quality and details
but I suggested you to listen music with it when you are not jogging/running
I wanted to love these earphones/monitors because the sound is AMAZING
Great bass, clear sound, and excellent isolation
However, I think they may have been made for the slightly larger (male
) ear
The foam tips, themselves, are comfortable when you find a good combination, but because these earphones require being wedged into the concha of the ear to stay in, it feels like the tips of the earbuds are being pushed too far into the ear canal, which is slightly painful
Tried them with different sizes of tips, but they were uncomfortable every time
If your ears are slightly larger, though, you should have no problem
I'm going back to my trusty Shure SE-115s, which seem to be a bit friendlier for the smaller ear
I recently replaced my E3 in ears with these because i lost my E3s
they are single driver instead of dual driver
but other then that the comfort is the same and they sound grab
since they are single driver i would only Recommend these for singers or personal use
they just won't give you what you need if your using them for Guitar bass keys or drums
well they will but will surely distort
all and all i knew what i was getting and i am happy with this product
ow small side note
They added a clip to the case which i am a big fan of (if my E3s had that i wouldn't have lost them)
These earbuds were exactly what I was looking for
Good, comfortable, sound suppressing earbuds at a reasonable price
Sound quality is great
I used these on an airplane and watched a movie
Sound was crystal clear and blocked out unwanted noise
These are very comfortable ear buds that have a great sound when they are put on correctly
Thus the rub, putting them in the ear correctly is not an easy task and takes some manipulation
Once on, they have good bass and mid range response and are particularly effective with symphonic and instrumental music
Their sound is a 5 star and their ease of use is a 1 star
However, I have found this positioning in the ear a problem with all ear buds
I would give these a 5 star but I found the highs/treble to be a touch too crackly/tinny for my taste with a flat EQ
Again, this is my taste
Others find the highs to be just fine
The treble reducer  EQ preset on my iPod resolves this issue
Mids and bass are very present and are produced very clean and clear
Bass is not muddy or overpowering, although it can be overpowering without being muddy via an EQ tweak if so desired (bass heads will not be disappointed)
A friend of mine has these and insists the highs sound better with the treble booster iPod EQ preset
I couldn't disagree more
We both agree the sound they produce is fantastic and fun
He has the black translucent set
I opted for the clear ones over black due to some reviews on head-fi suggesting the cable being slightly more stout
Also, they look interesting
Being able to see the single dynamic driver through the case is nice
But bottom line, the color choice was not terribly important to me
My primary use for these is while working out - cardio and weight training
In the 1&1/2  weeks I have been using them I can say they handle my abuse at the gym very well
I generally am rough with my gym equipment, earphones included
Although I take very good care of my things, I do not baby them
They did not fall out of my ears in any of  my exercises regardless of me being sweaty
They remained sealed in my ear canal very well at all times
I found that maintaining a good seal in the ear canal is key to achieving the best sound reproduction as well as sound isolation
Experiment with the 2 different types of tips(foam and silicone) in 3 different sizes(S,M,L) that are included
The foam tips are similar to the industrial style ones used in noisy environments such as job sites, power plants, fabrication shops and shooting ranges for actual hearing protection
I used the large foam tips that are included for best sound isolation
Although, medium foams fit ok too
I consider them my spare set
I did not try the silicone tips or 'olives' yet
I did not find the cord to be too long
I keep my iPod in my front pocket and the cord is a good length for me
The 3
5mm jack on these is on the larger side but did fit in my iPhone with Otterbox Defender case
In general i found the kevlar cord to be very well made and sturdy
Also, if the cord is damaged it alone can be replaced by un-snapping it from both canal-phones
The 'memory wire' that is used to keep the wire molded behind your ear can be a bit tricky to manipulate at first
Placing them into your ears can prove equally as tricky
However, with a little practice you will get used to it
Once they are in they fit my ears as if they were custom molded
I found the build quality on the canal-phones to be equally sturdy and well made
I suggest going to Shure's website [
]  for details
I would recommend to anybody
Especially with a strict spending limit of $100 as I had
They offer great bang-for-your-buck sound, fit, build quality, looks and 2 year warranty with customer service ratings to back it
In this price range I don't think one could do any better
I bought this item from Guitar center and decided to take the risk of buying it because the sales person said it's not returnable
It was $99 and I like the thought of it being sound isolation
Got home and tried to put this together and it was complicated and does not stay in the ear
On top of that, the sound quality is SO BAD
I ordered an $8 earphone from Amazon months ago (forgot the name brand) and it sounds WAY better than this $99 product
I so regret buying this item and I can't return it or even exchange it
So not satisfied
I originally bought a different SHURE earphones and didn't like it because the sound quality was really bad
So, i exchanged it for this piece
Worst shopping ever for me
NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER BUY ANY PRODUCTS BY SHURE
BE WARE
I am amazed at the detailed sound production of these earphones
I have previously owned Shure Se110 and Shure Se115, and these are completely on a new level
I hear more detail, more treble and a better sound stage
The bass is also very tight
I found that using the foam sleeves it was difficult to get a perfect seal, and so the bass was lacking
But after changing to the silicone sleeve solved the problem and it blocked more outside noise and I was able to feel more bass
Detachable cables are a plus, and Shure's 2 year warranty is one of the best in the business
I have previously returned my Se110 for distortion problems and Shure send me new pair without any questions asked
I totally stand behind this company and love their earphones
I hear instruments that i never knew were present before
These earphones are a great bang for your buck
For $100 you are getting a great product, 2 year warranty, detachable cables and one of the best build quality that I have seen
If you've been using the E2C's and looking for a replacement, this is not it
Don't get me wrong, these earphones are built with exceptional physical quality and the cord seems pretty robust
Sound is another issue entirely
I'm aware there is only one driver but the sound quality is absolutely terrible
Huge amount of muddy bass and frizzled clarity as I tested these phones from everything to Bjork / George Winston / Clara Ponty / Bon Iver / Feist / Fleet Foxes / Memphis May Fire / White Chapel / Between the Buried and Me / Beloved / Thelonious Monk / BB King
They sound much better as the phones are turned up louder but I shouldn't have to make that compromise to have a minimal par sound from a pair of $90 headphones
I really wanted to love these but unfortunately Shure didn't do these phones justice on the sound level
Looks like I'll be switching to Etymotic for now
I was using the original iPhone earphones for over 5 years
I decided to purchase this earphone based on many internet reviews and I'm very glad i did it
The sound quality is superb compared to my last earphone and the noise isolating is fantastic
Im using it right now, wile I'm studying and my neighbors are not disturbing me anymore
It is good to listen classic music, Hip-Hop, electronic, rock'n roll, reggae, etc
One of my main goals was to turn down my music volume, specially wile I'm at the gym (they put the environment sound to loud) cause i don't want to be deaf
Mission accomplished
Its working perfectly
I can run or workout and set the volume beneath 20% (using my iPod nano 6th generation)
It is not coming out wile I'm running and the sweating is not a problem anymore
The only con is the comfort of wearing it
Despite being way better than the iPhone earphones still a earphone so it take a wile till you get used to it
Conclusion: The internet reviews are right
This is the best earphones available under U$ 100
Just got these a few days ago
I bought them to wear at work to block out some noise from computer equipment
It is a tedious task to figure out how to put these in your ear if you have never used this type of listening device before
Once I got them in they were pretty good
Blocked out a decent amount of noise but very hard to take out to answer the phone and then put back in quickly
I actually have to tug on my ear quite a bit and push them in to get these to fit in my ear canal
I could see myself using these on a 14 hour plane ride with no problem or a very long walk
Otherwise I would probably just grab a pair of ear buds and be on my way
The foam tips that come with it were okay
It took forever for them to go back to their regular shape after being smushed and one was completely irregular to begin with so I couldn't use that one
I might try them again when I have the patience to wait around for them to expand and fit in my ear canal
It is nice that they offer the different sizes
I do love the fact that the cords are heavy duty and that the ear pieces swivel so the cord doesn't get tangled up
these are my first pair of "good" earbuds
before purchasing these I had always just bought skullcandy or similar earbuds
After 3 pairs of those had broken within 6 months of purchasing I decided to man up and buy some nice earbuds
These have fantastic sound quality, you can feel the bass, and all the way up the spectrum they sound fantastic
The one issue I have found with them is the noise isolation
My gripe may be good to some people though
I feel like at times the isolation is too extreme
As an example of the extremes of the isolation I was once sitting in my room listening to music on these and someone knocked on the door and called my name and I heard nothing
This can be great for when I'm riding the bus and I want some peace, but it can be a bit too much at times
But for the price you can't go wrong with these
If you want earbuds in this price range with equal sound quality that don't have the insane isolation that these have you should try the klipsch image s4
I have been using my new Shure SE 215-k for several weeks now and I like them better than the first pair that I got 4 years ago (they finally broke)
The fit is far superior, more secure than before
The cable is a little stiff compared to the previous set, but it should make them last longer
These things are great
They sound good, are cost effective, and I have no complaints
I use them for my in ear monitors with my band and am totally happy
I had a previous model and was throughly satisfied, it was advertised to reduce ambient nosie by 15 db
This model is rated at 35 db which I doubt; however, I just think that the selection of earpads they sent aren't compatible with my ears canal
I'm going to call Shure and ask them about my concern, I'm sure they will send an assortment of ear 'plugs' that will block about more noise and permit the unit to stay in my ears
I did meet with CS and they showed me how to properly insert the plugs
This new model is just great
They agreed that the instructions on how to insert the plugs needs to be updated
Update to the review
I have been using these headphones now for a few more weeks
The more i use them, the more i appreciate them
The sound is clean
It is critical to get the right fit using the various sizes of buds
I used the rubber ones, not the foam ones for a dramatic difference in performance
I want to reiterate how well these are made
They seem to be very high quality and the cord engineering is supreme
There are so many ear buds where the cord breaks in one fashion or the other and you have to throw them out
This actually has a replaceable cord
However, the cord itself is a heavier gauge which gives it a very solid feel and it does not tangle easily like thinner cords
The jack is heavier duty also than most ear buds i have seen
The sounds seems quite detailed and not bass heavy
The efficiency and volume are fine now that i got the right fit
I have not heard the higher end Shure's to know if there is an appreciable difference in the sound, but these sound quite good compared to some Bose ear-buds i have and Dre Beats which i think are too bass heavy
I have been using the buds for a couple of weeks now
I have Bose ones and some cheaper Dr Beats I got with HTC phone
At first I was quite disappointed with these phones
The low end was largely missing and when plugged into my laptop volume was poor
Then I started playing around with the different buds in the kit
This made a huge difference
I ended up using the rubber med ones
It dramatically changed the sound from the foam ones
These buds provide good detailed sound
The bass end is decent but not heavy if you like that
The Beats provide a much better low-end but are not as nuanced and detailed as these in my view
I think these provide a bit better sound than the Bose and are more isolating
So all in all these are good buds
My only issue was whether it was worth the money to step up to the 315's or higher in their line
One more thing,  I was impressed with the connecting wires on these
They are independent units
They are of a heavier quality wire and seem to be higher quality than I have found on other buds
If they should ever break,  you can probably just buy a new cable and not have to throw out the entire product which is what usually happens
I think this is a great innovation
I love these
I have had them for 3 weeks, the sound is just excellent
Great earbuds for the money (90 bucks)
The SE215 are great
Forward, reasonably lush mids, great bass with a little midbass hump but nothing like Westone 3; it's right in line with the subbass except when more impact is called for
Never drowns out the mids
Highs are unimpressive but also inoffensive, slightly rolled off, not very sparkly but fairly clear
Great buy at $100
Still my favorites after trying multiple higher end armature setups
I've been searching for something that delivers the same great balance of mids and bass and I have yet to find it
After having them for just one week, the right earphone began to cut out
By the end of the week, it would cut out with any movement
I sent them in for Shure warranty service and got a new pair (the entire process took about two weeks)
If you just want headphones that work and aren't a hassle, these aren't for you
Reading other reviews, it looks pretty likely (about 1 in 6) that these will start cutting out on you too
They are also a huge hassle to get on
It is hard to tell left from right (they're not labeled - you just have to remember that red is right and blue is left) and then you have to wrap the precious wires around your ears
This process means a lot of movement for the connector site of the earphone to the cable
It's no wonder they begin to malfunction so quickly
The sound quality is nothing special
Except for a stronger bass, they are indistinguishable from my cheap $15 SkullCandy headphones which are easy to wear, comfortable and have never cut out on me
Don't waste your money on this product
I have used Shure earbuds for a few years and absolutely love them
Except for this pair for two reasons
First - the earabuds are very difficult to adjust to the ear canal
It took a great deal of twisting and turning each bud for each ear
It never felt secure in the canal or the ear itself
The fit is extremely poor
Second - the quality of sound was awful, very tinny, male voices nearly sounded like females
I have many movies on my iPod and couldn't get the sound to be anything like the sound tracks
This Shure product is a great disappointment
It is going in my drawer to never be seen again
overpriced, really can't understand how I paid over 100$ for such annoying in-ear headphone, hifiman re262 is way better
the only thing that shure can beat hifiman over is the cables, shure cable is better
No bass
Tinny sound
But good ambient noise reduction possible using one of many sizes and types of tips included
Here's the deal: shure earphones short out where the cable connects to the speaker piece
4th pair of shures and absolutely my last (2 others have done the same thing)
Thought new detachable cable design would make a difference
It doesn't
Too bad because sound quality is great for the price
No longer will I exercise my insanity with this brand
I've used these new se215s 4 times and the left earphone is already cutting out
Same story
I buy earphones to USE them, not to screw with filling out repair reports and shipping services
I GUARANTEE  that if you buy these one or both sides WILL short out
Consider yourself warned and avoid these unless you like buying things that don't work
Don't make the same mistake that I did
I knew with the Shure name on this product that I wouldn't be disappointed
This was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old
It was the only thing he asked for - "a good pair of earphones"
He loves them
The best part is the spinning ear pieces that engage as you move your head or lean forward so they don't fall out
The sound quality is far superior than any other earphone he's owned
Packaging and accessories are also exceptional quality
He's going to take very good care of these and I suspect will own them for a long time
This is about my third pair of specialized earphones, and these are the best
I have a small head and the around-the-head style earphones are just too bulky to be comfortable for me
I initially had trouble fitting them around my ear properly, but once I got them on right they fit perfectly
They are the most comfortable earphones I've owned
They also block out most outside noise
And, the sound quality is great
Today I heard my music for the first time
Apparently, I've tolerated bad headphones for far too long
I listened to Knifes "Silent Shout" on the train ride home tonight and I wanted to hand the phones to other passengers and say "you've got to hear this
" I'm a Shure evangelist from this point forward
I have bought three or four sets of headphones in this series (they do wear out, or I break or lose them) and have always been satisfied
The phones on the new model - SE215 - are very comfortable and easy to insert and remove
The new feature of having the plug-in cords is helpful and smart; if the cord or earphone should break, you can replace just that part
That said, the whole set is fairly rugged
Sound isolation is superb
The sound has good balance with neither highs nor lows predominating (I do have a high-frequency hearing losss so I might be off here)
For the price point, it's hard to imagine a better buy
I did some research before buying the Shure SE215, reading reviews of various earbud products on Amazon and on blog sites devoted to reviewing products like these
Although I had heard of Shure products before (microphones, specifically), I had not heard of Shure earbuds prior to my research
Based upon that research, I bought the SE215
This is a great product
I am not an 'audio-phile' but the sound is spectacular, perhaps even as good as my Bose Q15 ANR headphones
Some reviews spoke about difficulty bending them around the ears
Either these folks were paid by another company to write something bad or they are just too inept to use any product - please keep knives away from these folks
I had them out of the box and in my ears within minutes and I have never had a problem with them
Other folks claimed, likely also disingenuously, that they would not stay in their ears
Before the Shure SE215, I never had earbuds that stayed in my ears
They all fell out, including the Bose earbuds
(Nothing against Bose, they make great products, but their earbuds did not stay in my ears
)  The Shure SE215's stick like glue
They have never fallen out
In fact, they fit so securely, that when walking, the vibrations from ones feet can be heard
Some might consider this a problem, but it will be the same with every set of earbuds that fit securely
Great product - I highly recommend them
I'm a drummer and I only use it for playing live
The sound is perfect and brilliant, the isolation is also awesome, but it could be a little more comfortable
During a 1h20m show I can't take it off for a single minute, and my ear starts to hurt a little after some time
I really dislike earphones that you have to shove into your ear, but for the portability and sound isolation, these are pretty amazing
I blasted my home stereo and then put these on and played a song from my iphone at 45% volume
I wouldn't have known my home stereo was still on if not for the desk shaking
I'm looking forward to using these on an upcoming flight
I have been a Shure fan since I bought the SE-210K's that I have used for the last five years
I'm not sure why, but I never had the problems others did with cords fraying and such
I did have problems with corrosion on the metal jacks from my sweat
Also, over time I noticed that I was losing some sound in the left earphone, so I finally decided to upgrade
The sound that poured from these earphones (the SE-215's) into my ears is AMAZING
I was accustomed to the SE-210 sound and didn't expect too much of a change, just some improvement back to "baseline"
The music is crisp and clear with great range
I run with these and I had to reset the volume limit on my iPod nano to keep from damaging my hearing
The fit is a bit strange at first
with the SE-210's, I was accustomed to jamming the set into my ear canal as far as possible
The design of these is such that that's impossible, and I was at first concerned that I wasn't going to get a good seal
No problem with that at all, and they stay in place just as expected when doing the hour-long run
They have improved the slider that controls how much play you have with each individual wire to the ear so that it stays in place better than the prior model
I spent a while debating whether to go with the SE-215's and the next higher model (315's
), but the cost kept me in the 215 range
I have NO regrets whatsoever, at this point, and am totally content with having saved $100 AND getting GREAT sound
I love these ear buds
I thought that these buds compared to the last pair of Sennheiser buds that I had purchased and were more comfortable
More comfortable, but had a very crisp high ends
This was great, but to me the bass was a bit compromised at times
If you run an EQ this becomes a moot point and most audio sources have a downloadable EQ
After I bought these last year I sprung for some really upscale buds, i
e
, the Sennheiser IE80's
I think that at this point that I've reached perfection to my ears
I have never been a fan of running with headphones for two reasons: They always fall out of my ears, and running on the streets without full use of hearing seems dangerous
I am always on the look out for headphones that will stay in my ears while running for use on the treadmill or on trails
I came across this article recommending the Shure SE215 for great sound quality and security in ear
I have always used cheap earphones that you can buy at the gym or Target so I was not familiar with the more high end products like Shure, Etymotic and Klipsch
My friend Lauren owns an audio supply company and gave me some Shure SE215 earphones to try out
Immediately out of the box you can see and appreciate the quality of these earphones
They have 3 basic parts
1
Ear foam acts like an earplug and blocks out almost all noise
2
The driver produces the sound3
The cord that attaches the driver to your music of choice
After a 5 mile run the earphones are solidly in place
I never had to adjust them at all
I have found that the key to success with these ear phones is the fit of the earplug part
They come with 6 different sizes to fit any ear canal, so fitting should not be a problem for most people
3 sizes foam and 3 sizes rubber and 1 tool for cleaning out the driver canal
The noise isolation is really great with these earphones as well
I have used a pair of Beats Studio headphones and these earphones block an equal amount of ambient noise for 1/3 the price
The SE215 would be great to use on an airplane or anywhere you don't want people to bother you
With the good sound isolation comes one drawback
They act like earplugs, so you can hear everything in your head
It is impossible to use these earphones while eating, the sound of your own chewing is immense
While running there is also a constant boom boom boom with every footfall, this may be distracting for some, it was easy for me to ignore
Overall these are some really great earphones and I would recommend them to anyone who wants great sound and good sound isolation

The SHURE 215 headphone set is my second set of noise-cancelling headphones from SHURE
My first set was the SHURE 425 EAC model
I was expecting the same headphone, but they are not
The SE 215 design is set to twist into your ear
This is not too much of a problem, but it does irritate me
The sound is good, and you get very good customer service
As long as you have access to your invoice for the headphones, you are pretty much guaranteed a strong warranty
I accidently broke an earpiece last month
I called SHURE, and was told to send it in with a printed invoice
Since I had purchased the SE215 from Amazon
com, it was easy to print a copy
The piece was replaced quite quickly and without any hassle
I have not had the headphones long enough to give a strong write up on the SE215, but I have no problem providing good comments on the SHURE company itself
Also, the 425 EACs were awesome
I just wish I could have purchased another set of those headphones
I had used them for 7 years while riding my Harley Wide Glide and could hear my music very cleanly and without hearing my exhaust note
I do not have the same statement for the SE 215s
When I wear my full-face helmet, I can hear the music cleanly, but then my ears get irritated from the headphones rubbing against the helmet intermittently
Overall, I currently say that if you wish to wear the headphones while riding your Harley, you will be fine; but you will not have 100% noise reduction
If you wear a 3/4 or full-face helmet, you will hear the music cleanly, but might experience ear irritation
For most other purposes, you should be fine with the headphones
As for customer service, provided you have your invoice, the company is VERY ACCOMODATING
I have now had the earphones for a few months and have gotten used to wearing them
Trust me, it does take a while to get used to wearing them properly
When worn properly, the headphones DO cut out the exhaust note of my Harley
And, the music sounds clear and interference-free
SO, for those of you who wish to purchase these headphones, know you are gettng quality headphones and quality customer service with your purchase
I have now had the headphones for a full riding season and I am very happy with them
if you are looking for reasonable price and good performance, this is it
i was looking for an isolation earphone when i travel on the tube
it works great, i cannot hear the massive noise now
love it
I have had Shure 5 series, 3 series, and now these 215's
For me the difference in price and the total range quality of these 215's is near equal
I am not an audiophile but I know what sounds best to me
The 215's at the price of around $100 are by far the best value for the money
And the carabiner snap carrying case will hopefully prevent me from leaving these on airplanes
Very expensive losses
So, I upgraded to decent headphones a few years back
I found Shure and that's the brand I stick with
I use them all the time
I travel a lot and wear them constantly while on planes, I use them in the workshop in lieu of earplugs, and I wear them while mowing the lawn
They sound very nice, I can't proclaim how nice as I don't feel qualified to compare them with an audiophile's vocabulary but they are exponentially better than what you get with any device
I also upgraded them with the phone accessory and use them for phone calls all the time
Much better than a wireless bluetooth headset
don't run out of batteries either
That all being said, I have had issues in the past with the sheath over the wires cracking and splitting after a time
This new design, with the earphones being separate, seemed like a great idea
When the cords get mangled or fall apart, get new ones
So, the cord got mangled and I ordered a new one
Removing the earphones and putting them on the new cord, something broke in one of the earphones
Not sure what I did wrong but back to Shure for repair
They replaced it under warranty (they have great service) but still a bit of a hassle
They are great earphones and I recommend them
But, if you use them as heavily as I do, recognize they will not last forever and you will need to replace them on a periodic basic
This is the primary reason I have avoided any of their higher priced earphones
I would be really upset to have to replace a $400 pair every year (or less)
'Legendary Performance'
That's what it says on the box
Sounds like a typical product selling point
Sure, Shure, your products are legendary
I get it
You have a good marketing department
They'll probably be good
Maybe even marginally great
So, with that in mind, here's what happened:Unboxed headphones
Sifted through needless papers warning be about death and destruction from using headphones (I didn't read into it that far
Might not have said this)
Slipped buds into earsTurned on tunes
*Mind blown*So, for comparison, I normally listen to a pair of open-air Sennheiser HD570s
They are good
I mean, really, truly, amazingly good headsets
But they are open air, and I wanted something for the office
These Shures are mind-blowingly good indeed
The bass is strong, but not over the top
The midrange and trebles are astounding
Instantly, I can hear detail in some tracks that I've never heard before with my Sennheisers
The sound is warm and open
The seal that the earbuds make is really amazing
Personally, I'm a huge fan of the foam that Shure uses on these headphones
For the price, these headphones have no right being this good
Best pair of $100 IEMs out there
A relatively neutral soundscape with punchy bass (not overwhelming though)
Highly recommended for the price range
The Shure SE 215 earbuds are the best earbuds that i ever bought
I've owned many earbuds, literally, but none like these
I'm new to the "audiophile" world and have not been very experienced with really good headphones but on the price margin I can say that these are the best out there
These buds out perform more expensive earbuds of its price range, especially the Beats by dre, no disrespect or hate intended but these headphones blow it out of the park
I have owned these for over a year and a half and the sound is fantastic, unequally by any other earbud in this price range that I've tried (and I've tried a few)
However, they do suffer a design flaw
Basically they allow sweat to corrode the gold or otherwise break contact if one uses them in the gym for very long
This WILL happen unless you just happen to not sweat at all, so I wanted to post how I fixed the problem
To fix them, you need to clean and protect the contacts from additional corrosion (yes, Gold DOES develop oxidation under the salty acidic conditions of sweat)
Buy a tube of DeoxIT� Liquid contact cleaner and, if you would rather not have to keep cleaning it every year or two, DeoxIT� GOLD Liquid protector
They are sold here for under $10 each for 2ml tubes
Just pull the ear buds off the wires, squeeze or spray the cleaner on both the female socket and male push pin, let it sit for a minute or so, wipe it off, then squeeze or spray on the gold protector on both too, wiping the extra off
Finally snap them back together
Viola
If you used the gold protector, now they won't cut out ever again, but even if you just use the cleaner, they probably won't cut out for many months or even a year
I've now owned 5 pairs of quality, sub-$100 ear buds and this is my favorite pair yet
I first bought a pair of Etymotic ER6i's which had a nice, clean sound although they were a bit thin on the bass
Thin wiring finally gave out on those and one of the ear buds quit working
I also had a pair of Klipsch Custom 2's, a dual driver IEM that had a rich, warm sound that I really liked
A trip through the washing machine damaged the cables which gave out completely soon after
Since then, I bought another pair of Etymotics (MC-5) and a pair of Klipsch S4's
I've been pretty happy with both of those, although both pairs have their weaknesses that have bothered me a bit and I kept thinking I could find something better around the same price point
After reading positive reviews of Shure's IEM's for years I finally decided to get a pair
I bought these SE215's and I can't praise them enough
First, the build quality on these is unbelievable
The cables are much thicker and heavier than any other pair of ear buds I've owned
Everything about the fit and finish on these feels solid and gives the impression they will stand up to some abuse
Like the Klipsch Custom 2's I owned, where the cables come out of the ear buds, they have a small section of memory wire that you loop over the top of your ear rather than just dangling down like most ear buds
This takes a bit of getting used to (mostly when putting them on), but works well once you get the hang of it
They sound great
The bass is deep and solid, but doesn't overwhelm the midtones and highs which are crisp and clean
Compared to my Etymotic MC5's the bottom end is much more robust and satisfying
And the mids and highs are cleaner than with my Klipsch S4s
I have a difficult time believing you'll find anything that sounds better without going into the $150-200 price range
I'm a runner, and I always take in to account how a pair of head phones will perform when running
The Etymotics and the Klipsch pair are both pretty solid for running with only a couple of issues
They both can produce a lot of cable noise which tends to cause you to increase the volume to drown it out
And they both have a tendency to start working their way loose in your ears as you begin to get sweaty
Both of these issues appear to be solved with these Shures
The heavy duty cables and the way you loop them over your ears solves the cable noise problem
The only complaint I've got is that I wasn't really happy with the included sleeves
I got a good seal with the silicone sleeves, but they have a small ridge going around them (from the molding process I assume) that irritates my ears when I put them in
And I had a difficult time getting a good seal with the memory foam sleeves
I suspect if I experiment with them a bit more I may like them, but they also seem pretty fiddley
something you can't just pop in and out
I ended up using a pair of dual-flange sleeves that came with my Klipsch Custom 2's
They fit on the ear buds easily and are easy to quickly get on and make a good seal
I've very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality, excellent sounding pair of IEM's for under $100
These earbuds have very good sound quality, but my disappointment with them is the lack of iPhone compatibility
The optional phone cable accessory is way too expensive for a low quality wire
The phone cable isn't designed for "over the ear", doesn't have the cable ear reinforcement, and the button assembly looks clunky
The included cable has such a large mini jack connector that it doesn't fit with most phone cases such as the Apple bumper case
There's no excuse for this after 6 years of smartphones
Shure desperately needs to offer these earbuds with the option of a higher quality phone cable instead of the normal cable
I have been on the search for high quality IEM's for a while now
I have tried: Skullcandy Titans and FMJ's, Monster Turbines, Sennheiser CX 880 and CX 400-II and now the Shure SE 215's
Monster definitely were the best up until these
My normal over ears are my Sennheiser HD 439's
They are not collapsable, so i needed some new buds to match the really great sounds my cans reproduce
Alrighty on to the review :~)Sound: The clarity of these IEM's are incredible
Each layer is vivid and distinct while perfectly complimenting each other
I like a more "warm" sound, thats why I use Sennheisers for over ears
These buds have that same feeling
Very warm without being muddied and sacrifices the Highs
Lows are well defined between mid and sub bass levels
Bass heads will love these buds
Sound signature overall is VERY similar to the Monster Turbines (which are lightyears ahead of the Beats line)
Fit: This is where these IEM's outshine the turbines
Now it takes a little while getting used to the around the ear fit for IEM's (they were my first)
You cannot feel them whatsoever once they are in your ears
They run flush in your ear so you can actually sleep in them without feeling pain in the side in my head
You really need to try out all the different tips to get the seal you need to have a great sound from this product
I personally use the large memory foam tips (I have big ears)
Once all the above is met, these are by far the most comfortable IEM's I have ever used
Build: Solid build quality
By far the best feature of this set is detachable cables
IEM's are famous for cord strain failure
I believe its only $15 to replace the cables from Shure's website
Bottom Line: Get them
AT $100, i dare you to find a better set of IEM's
I have been searching and searching and searching for a headphone that will NOT fall out when I'm running and sweating
I have had this headphone for about one year and a few months and they no longer stay in my ears
When I first got them, they seemed to work at staying in, but now the wire that goes over the top of the ear is worn out and I'm constantly fidgeting with them to keep them in my ears even after changing the buds
I cannot even use them for just sitting around
Great sound if you are NOT using them for serious exercise where you will sweat a lot
The cord is also heavy and awkward to put on
Overall these are NOT worth the $100 price tag for an exercising headphone that you will have to dispose of in one year
I am online now because I am AGAIN searching for new headphones that will STAY IN MY FREAKING EARS WHEN I RUN AND SWEAT
ANY SUGGESTIONS
I can't believe it's only one driver inside you hear everything and it's not too much bass
I've had other ear buds bose, monster turbine, klipsch
All around the same price but these beat all of them easily
I bought this headphones to use as In Ear Personal Monitoring System at the church
I play drums and the noise canceling is great, the sound is flat (sometimes too flat for my taste but is not a bad thing) but has great preasure
It takes some time to know how to fit them properly in your ears, but once you learn you understand why they are constructed that way
They realy worth every cent
It's shure, no more words needed
These headphones are fantastic
Previous reviews are correct, it takes a bit to get the fit right, but there are plenty of ear bud options with the unit
It also take a bit getting used to the way they insert, by wrapping around the ear, but once you get used to it, it's really nice and keeps them secure in the ear
I am a bit of an audiophile and have a Linn british HiFi at home with great clarity, so I am usually very disappointed by in ear products
I ride motorcycle on long trips, and so far these are fabulous
With previous in ear units, I would have to have a significant volume to over come the wind noise in my helmet, but with these and the noise cancellation, I can really reduce the volume, and with the way they fit, they stay secure easily putting the helmet on and off
Sturdy construction, nice long cord
One of the best purchases I have made in a long time
If you're looking for a quality in ear headphone under $100
00, look no further, GET THESE
I'm using the smallest plug and it still seems too big
This hanging over your ears is a joke
Can't be done
Wires are too long, so it's hard to get a good seal to block out other sounds
I bought these earphones becauase of the great reviews but it actually sounds no better than the cheap Skullcandy's  Ink'd I bought for $15
Comparing the two,  I hear just a slight difference in the detail of what I'm hearing than the Skullcandy's (which is in favor of the Shure's)
Volume wise it is about the same
I bought a Cowon J3 which has 39 presets and BBE Effect which is supposed to make the music sound better
I know that Cowon players have amazing sound but are horrendous in other areas
Put the setting on Maestro on the Cowon J3 and you will hear incredible sound just out of the Skullcandy's
I used my Android phone with the Shure SE215's, which comparably sounds similar on my Cowon player, but the volume is lower and I heard very  little bass
I also bought the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd (which is exactly as it says, it has a microphone) and it has excellent sound and bass
It also sounds even better in my phone than these Shure SE215's
The only real problem with the Skullcandy Ink'd is they don't last more then 2 months and the sound goes
But the Skullcandy Ink'd Mic'd I've had for 5 months
You can also get a voucher through their website to replace your earphones
Overall, I'd say save your money, get a good media player or phone and stick with the cheap Skullcandy's
I have spend the last 3 years looking for great sounding earphones, and have spend at least double the cost of these amazing earphones in that quest
I finally broke down after reading the wirecutter's review [
] and ordered a set
I have been extremely pleased with both the sound and build quality, they block out almost all of the external noise, and the highs sound great, and the lows are nicely balanced (no more stupid skullcandy too much bass issue for me)
You have to be a pure audiophile to not love them
3 best things1
Sound quality2
Build is sturdy with nice thick wires but not so thick they are unmanageable
3
Can replace damaged wires without having to buy a while new pair with detachable ear piece
I just got these and put them on with the medium foam ear pieces and they are amazing
All I can hear on my kit is my snare
They block tons of noise and sound AMAZING
I recommended these to everyone I know
Preston - drummer
I owned the Shure E2 ear buds and the wire was completely worn out after 4 years of use, which is understandable
I purchased these to replace the E2 set and there is not much of a difference
The overall design is slightly better, the ear buds are smaller and thinner causing less inner ear discomfort
The old ear tips do not fit on the new ear buds, but the new ear tips are very similar except now you don't have to fool with the sticky guard that never stayed in place anyway
The swivel feature on the ear buds is nice but it's hard to automatically realize which bud is right and which is left
I always have to look for the R or the L instead of just looking at them and knowing which is which like with the E2
The sound is slightly better than the E2 ear buds but that could also just be that they are new
Overall they are a nice upgrade from the E2 ear buds so if you are in the market for a new set of Shure ear buds buy these, you won't be disappointed
I've gone through my share of ear buds and Shure makes the most durable snug fitting buds I've found to date
I'm 6' tall and the cord length is perfect
A dropped player has its momentum broken just before hitting the ground, and unlike other headphone cables, the cord can take it
The replaceable cord is a great feature
Though a bit expensive for a cord, it beats having to replace the entire setup
I'm no expert, but sound quality is as good as anything else as far as I can tell
Wearing these buds makes me feel superior as I watch all the crappy-ass ear bud people around me
Don't be a loser
Pony up the few extra shekels to get a quality product
If your looking for earphones that sound great and have nice bass, then these earphones are a great choice
They are very comfortable but only if you put them in your ear properly
At first they seem weird because they are different from other earphones that I have worn but after a few days I found out how to properly put them on my ear to fit very comfortably, and this position also gives you the best bass
I am very satisfied with these earphones
Bought these about a month ago, and so far, I love it
The sound quality is really good, the bass hits the right spot, it's very well balanced
Only problem is that the left earphone SOMETIMES cuts off, so I hope this doesn't evolve to a complete cut off anytime soon
Shure SE215 Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)
Quality material and just as important, quality sound
worth every penny
Shure SE215 Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)
I used Seinheiser CX300 (around $70) for 3 years and then one channel stopped working I bought this entry level Shure
Sound is good for $100 earphones but it gives inconvenient feeling in the ear channel, over the ear cable wear makes the phones hard to install
(it is not really hard, bur require additional effort comparing to CX300 where installation was done in one single move with one hand)Wires are extremely non flexible and thick
The 3
5 jack is extremely thick and will not fit to iphone 4 bumper phones holeI use it for 2 weeks already and trying to get used to it, but still feel pain in the ear channel after long wear (i tried several soft and rubber cushions already)
> UPDATEafter 2 years i love it - tried to replace - no chance for ie2 or westone1
and i'm changing its to 5 star
Got these to replace E3's - with the refinement of the microdriver, it smokes it six ways from Sunday-combine that with replaceable cords and optional microphone/Apple compatible control cords it is simply the best bang-for-the buck headset out there
Everything about this headphones is great
I got it on time and really liked the quality of the product
I've been using Shure for almost 5 years now and the SE215-K is the best one ever
These Shure IE2s are awesome
I tried the Bose IE2 headphones prior to buying this pair
The Bose had lots of bass but seemed to be missing the high and mids
These Shure headphones have both the punchy bass of the IE2s and crisp, bright mids and highs
I had the Shure E2Cs and Bose TriPorts prior to these
The Shure IE2s are quite an upgrade
After reading many reviews on various headphone, I selected these as a Christmas gift for my college age son
I have experience with Shure record cartridges from back in the day, and they always delivered great sound
These were delivered days ahead of the anticipated schedule and the box was packed well and the product was as ordered
My son began wearing the headphones the afternoon of Christmas and instantly made comment as to the sound quality compared to the ear buds he had been using with his I-Phone
After a week or so of him being back for the Christmas break, I asked if I could try out and hear how these shure headphones delivered music
He was happy to show me the way to put these in the ear and drape the cord over my ear
I experimented with various music from his I-Tunes and then played some music off Pandora on my own I-Phone
I found the sound very clear, clean and dynamic
The buds felt comfortable in my ears
They also did a tremendous job of blocking out any outside noise
When I go to replace my own headphones, these will be ones I purchase
Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and my son is VERY PLEASED with the gift
These are extremely well built, fit the ear like a professional studio ear bud, deliver great sound and are available at a price point that wont break the bank, but that also makes you aware to take care of them as they are a fine product
I don't normally write reviews of products, but I have to say that these are the best headphones I have ever purchased
I don't know if my ears are just shaped differently, but every other pair of headphones I purchased would fall out while I was working out
I have never had an issues with these headphones falling out
I highly recommend watching the Shure video on how to properly wear them in the ear
I also recommend wearing them so the wire goes behind your ears and down your back
That minimizes any noise from the cord rubbing on your clothes
Well worth the price I paid ($99
00)
After using typical skull candy and default apple brand headphones for all of my life, these things were a huge step up
I am very please, the quality is amazing
It is like listening to all of my favorite songs for the first time
It muffles out other sounds extremely well, the fit is great, and the quality is perfect
Users should know that these are bass heavy, so I wouldn't get them if you don't like the enhanced bass
But who doesn't love enhanced bass
I initially wanted to spend much more on some of the higher end buds from Monster, Sony or even Shure, but I settled on a budget of around $100 to replace a pair of Sonys that cost me about that much six years ago
I decided on these after reading reviews
The first thing I noticed was the more substantial, thick cord
It seems like it will be less susceptible to breaking down and also tangling like the thin cord on the Sonys did
These earbuds come with a good amount of accessories for fitting and storage
There is a baggie of different ear tips made of silicone and foam
The medium sized foam tips that were already installed seemed to fit great right out of the box and I'm not sure that I will even bother trying anything else
The foam tips seem to create a much better seal than the silicone tips on the Sonys I had
and they stay put
Because of this, the bass response is quite good and the noise isolation is noticeable
Additionally, they come with a zippered soft case
The case is good quality and will be great for storage and travel as I frequently transport my headphones in my gym bag, to work and when travelling
I am no audiophile, but I wanted something that is above average in terms of quality and sound
For $100 these were definitely worth it
Time will tell how good the quality really is, but I have the feeling that these will last for quite a few years
These are, quite simply, an outstanding pair of earbuds and a tremendous value
The key to getting great sound from them is inserting them correctly -- READ THE INSTRUCTIONS
You can easily insert them incorrectly; if you do, they WILL sound bad
I think that many (most
) of the negative reviews must have been written by buyers who weren't using them correctly
The biggest difference between the SE215 and, say, the SE200 (which I previously owned) is the quality of the seal and sound isolation
The SE200 fits like a pair of earplugs (the kind you'd wear to sleep); the SE215 fits like a pair hearing aids, held securely in the ear canal AND in contour of your ears
With the cables looped over your ears, there is absolutely no reason why these should fall out
What really matters is sound quality and in this area, the Shure 215 shines
Bass is full without being overpowering, mids & highs are clear & crisp
I literally heard qualities in my music that I never heard before
I recommended them to a musician friend who was initially skeptical that they could be as good as I claimed
We rarely talk on the phone but he called me just to tell me how stoked he was about these earbuds
This is my second pair of Shure earphones
The first lasted five years of heavy use before the cable failed
I purchased these largely because of the replaceable cable
The quality is outstanding
the cable is thick and supple, the cable connector fits tightly, and the selection and fit of the eartips is great (Shure eartips have always fit me better than any other brand)
The sound is very good, with full bass, warm midrange, and clear treble
However, these do have a somewhat forward, slightly heavy sound, not quite the precise timing and spacious soundstage that some other quality earphones have (the Etymotic HF2's have a much more precise, although light on bass, sound)
That said, I think that 99% of users (myself included) will prefer the warm, powerful sound of the Shure's
In the future I'll probably buy some higher end Shure's but for now these are great
My only real complaint is the cost of the iPhone cable sold separately (see my separate review)
Please note that Shure earphones are designed for the cable to be passed behind the ear for a secure fit
something that some glasses wearers (again, myself included) can find a little awkward at times
Don't waste your money on this product
I have used Shure earbuds for a few years and absolutely love them
Except for this pair for two reasons
First - the earabuds are very difficult to adjust to the ear canal
It took a great deal of twisting and turning each bud for each ear
It never felt secure in the canal or the ear itself
The fit is extremely poor
Second - the quality of sound was awful, very tinny, male voices nearly sounded like females
I have many movies on my iPod and couldn't get the sound to be anything like the sound tracks
This Shure product is a great disappointment
It is going in my drawer to never be seen again
very comfortable
It breaks in a week
I love these headphones
They always stay in my ears while running and have great sound quality
They were an excellent price too
I really love the earpuds
I been using for the past two years with no any major issue
As student i through and put my earbuds everywhere, and still working great
As sound quality goes are fine
I mean you get what you pay for if you want something with very high quality then you have to aim for something more expensive
Best little ear buds around
I bought a pair last month and it lost sound in one ear after a few days of use
POOR QUALITY
worst earbuds ever they don't make sound hope the seller reads this
Not bad for only $10
Love these head phones, went through the washer and still worked and sounded exactly the same
Would buy again
They work as expected
For the price they are definitely worth the money
I just bought them so I can't speak for the longevity of them
What I will say is that the sound is really impressive
Now remember we're talking about a under $10 product here so I'm not going to be that critical
As of late I base sound quality on how well something with reproduce NIN Hesitation Marks and do it respectfully for what they are
The only issue I had was I wish the cord was longer
I am 6'2 though
This is great
Purchased product in May
I use during daily work out
Worked well until September
Previously had Panasonics at same price point and lasted one year
they work great and provide good sound
I did have an issue with one of the small buds missing that wouldn't be a problem except that's the size i needed
Still the medium ones seem to work OK
I was told when I called that there wasn't a way to send just one set to replace the missing one and I didn't want the hassle of returning all of it and reordering
So I'll make do
You can only critique a $10 product lightly
Works good
The left speaker was blown out
Awsome, comfortable earbuds
No crackling, gotta love Sony
Good quality inexpensive earbuds
love these - and price certainly right
The headphones are very nice for the price
I can be very hard on headphones that I wear to work; I always seem to catch the cord on something and it rips them from my ear
Eventually they quit working; imagine that
I needed a headphone that was affordable enough to not cause me anxiety when I ruined them
These fit comfortably and have surprising sound
I would definitely buy these again
Had a pair of these for almost 2 years before they fully gave out
I use these for my job (factory work) everyday, so they get a little bit of wear and tear, but I have purchased and gone through Skull Candies and various other expensive headphones and by far these headphones are amazing especially for $10
I would recommend these headphones to anybody looking for a good pair for work or anything else for that matter
Best $10 you will ever spend on headphones
the left side of the earphone became malfunctioned after two weeks
not worth the price
Very cheap good sound quality
Remember if you want something extraordinary you have to pay more than usual
Don't waste your money
I have used for a short time and one headphone does not work
It doesn't work at all
I am really disappointed
I thought a Sony product would be of a good quality
Nice headphones
Fit comfortably in ear and block out outside noise
Good for the price
Used to play with drumset and works well at allowing me to hear music while playing because it fits in ear good
Good sound quality
good
at 20 days were not working
The left airbud doesn't work
I've waited a week for these
big disappointment
very good for the price
I love the way these headphones fit in my ear but I've owned 4 pairs and they always break
Only one ear piece plays music which is so annoying
Happened to all 4 of them
was shorting out
was hoping for a better quality in a band new product
The sound is warm and natural
But
Stopped working after two months of use
I ordered 2 of these headphones and both of them came broken
WOW
Fast delivery and product looked as advertised
Thank you
There Very nice high quality earphones recommend this to someone that loves to listen to music all day
Great sound and sturdy :)
great
A rock solid purchase every time I buy them
I have at least 3 pairs of these right now, one for travel, one around the house and another for my wife
I lost a fourth pair when my kid mangled them in the lawn mower
(grrrr
No pun intended)
After 2 weeks the left earbud quit working
Thumbs down
Not even sure if they're really a sony product
Great product
Great price
Great
Good sound and comfortable
Reasonably priced
Great
The right ear piece ceases to function
This is the second set that it has done it to me
I do not know why but it is getting wearisome
not good immediately not working waste money only
Just what I expected from a Sony product
I work in a noisy environment and like how the rubber earpiece sits deep in my ears
Nice full sound, top to bottom
Don't know why the white ones are cheaper than the black ones, but it's the sound and fit that matter
I'm not crazy about these earbuds
They're okay for $10, deliver the sound they're supposed to produce
The detail is that they feel cheap (they are) and you feel when something's gonna break soon
I've already noticed the left speaker occasionally looses connection to the jack somewhere along the cable
But if you're not active and only use them while sitting down, these earbuds are for you
Good noise canceling and ndecent sound
The sound quality was great for the price, but one ear stopped working within six weeks of purchase
Also, the metal jack has some "give" where it connects to the cord
Lasted less than two month
Right bud is silent now
broke less than two months after I got them
Within a 5 year span I must have owned 4 pairs of these sony in ear headphones
I'm sure there are better headphones out there, but for the comfortibility and price these are very worth the buy
sent back, junk
One channel did not work right out of the package
Sony was a good company
Very Good
I think it's best for the price and i always trust sony because they have one of the best quality products on market
Item is ok but just not the quality i expected
Need more Bass sound
perfect
Only 1 bud worked, no sound out the left ear
Good temporary earphones when you are in between good ones and don't have the immediate funds
Right bud has already gone out after about a month
Sound is OK, not good not bad
Sound quality is pretty good but transducer dBSPL/mW output a little low
They're headphones that produce reasonable quality sound
Not much more to say than that
Good price
They worked great for over 7 months, but now the left earbud doesn't work
The sound really surprised me
I'll definitely be getting another pair once these wear out
I have used this earphone for two years
This is my second one
I like the design, clear and easy to figure out which one is R or L
I like the color, also
Very comfortable, very clear for the price
I use them to listen to audio books, rather than music
great product - great price
I bought them for backup headphones and when I pulled them out the left side didn't even work
I check the ends and the end connected to the 3
5mm jack was ripped
I purchased these a while ago and pulled them out yesterday
Great quality
I've had these for almost 2 years now & they're amazing
The sound quality is great & they've lasted me quite a while
I highly recommend them
OK
My right earbud has broken in 3 of my pairs
has sounds coming out of it what an amazing product
Best
High quality
however, one just stopped working in about 4 weeks
Not that big of a deal inexpensive
Consequently from now on i will purchase more expensive ear buds
good daily headphones, the cords are easy to break thats why they only get 4 stars, but theyre so well priced you can easily by a replacement after a couple months
I can only say that these ultra low cost ear buds give you a clear and airy representation of music when played on a phone or I touch
Pianos, vocals, drums, saxophones and guitars all sound like the true instruments
You don't have to pump the volume up to 10 either
If you like to hear the music played through earphones that make you feel like you are in the room with the artists when they are doing the recording , then you will enjoy these Sony 's
Whether you like  popular music or older rock and jazz
I own many expensive headphones
Price means nothing
Trust me on that
i love the sound these deliver
I do find myself buying a new pair every 2-3 months since the wire within the cord tends to break but these are still the best bang for the buck I've found for sound vs daily use without breaking the bank
excellent
I got these earphones and they didn't even work
A++++
These worked for about 11 months, then one earbud stopped working as numerous others have noted
Even though they are cheap, I expect a product from Sony to last
While they worked, the sound quality was pretty good for the price but may not offer value in the long-term
Skip these and find a better pair
It broke 
great sound, different choices of color and earbud fits, quality earphones, long cord, too
:) i love them
Good fit, good sound
great
They broke after 1 week of use
Nice headphones , decent sound for the price
My only problem is it seems the volume is a bit low on it forcing you to turn up the volume on the device you are using
Good sound for the money
L & R buds are marked plus angled inspited of what others have written
Had them for a good two years, then one of the ear buds stopped working
A week after that, they broke all together
I am most certain that it was the flimsy cord, that was very small and thin, broke them
Average - good sound quality and were comfortable
Ear buds stayed in well, most of the time anyways
Buy if you do not use them roughly, and do not stuff them in your pocket
Ordered these on the 10th, and the right ear bud completely died by the 30th
No bass what-so-ever
Just save your money
the left side did not work at all
sent back to amazon
will not order these again
Earphones had reasonably clear sound
For low end earphones, I don't think you could find better
Plugs and cording appeared adequate
I would recommend to a friend looking for low cost replacement earphones
The in-ear headphones work and the price is right
thanks so much ¡¡
Like many of the other reviews, the sound quality of these ear buds deteriorate after a few months of use
The left ear bud went out and the static it produces is actually painful on the ear drum
I used to own Skullcandy Inkd, but they tend to do the same thing
The quest for a functioning ear bud continues
They work perfectly
And at a low price
Wish they would last longer but what do you expect for the price
Good soundquality and comfort
The first time I ordered these headphone the right ear phone was own out
I was sent a new pair days later and within less than a month the left ear randomly stopped working from that pair
I decided to write this review the moment the product started to defect
I purchases these earphones about 3 months ago and just recently, I noticed a defect
I've realized the volume was unbalanced, the left bud had a lower volume than the right bud
Before coming to the conclusion that it was the earphones itself, I made sure it wasn't the listening device that was causing the problem (PC, phone)
Also during the investigation, I did not use any sources of sound that had the possibility of creating unbalanced volumes (music), instead I used the built in audio testing programs, which would produce a sound on each ear
Conclusively, I tested other headphones on the same devices and the volume came out perfectly even on both sides, while this earphone persisted to produce uneven volumes
So this is my review, it worked fantastically out of the box, but unfortunately this defect has put a stain on the product
Somewhat uncomfortable with the sharp edges,
I get these about once every two months because they are cheap
They only last that long for hard sweaty workouts every day
I should probably splurge and get the more expensive sport ones, but at least if I lose these, no worries
The sound quality is excellent, while they work
Poor sound quality for music
I ended up buying Apple EarPods
Clear no matter the volume
Does't fit my left ear perfect but certainly adequate for most people
Love these, my ears are small so these are the only kind that don't hurt my ears after an hour of wear
Don't buy
Really cheap
One ear bud already stopped working and I've only had them a week
I really like these in-ear headphones because they cancel out a lot of noise, even if they're not actually noise-cancelling headphones
I also like how they offer 3 different ear bud sizes
Unfortunately, my first pair eventually broke after a year because the wires became exposed at the base, which eventually led to one ear losing sound
I bought another pair anyway because I like them a lot and none of my headphones ever seem to last very long
These headphones are nice especially for the price
The sound is excellent they are not going to be super loud but they get the job done
Before buying these i had a used blue pair that i got from my cousin and those lasted me 2 years until the left headphone gave out
If you want durability these are the headphones your looking for ive accidently put them in the washer and they still work perfectly
They didn't work
Thanks
Fast shipping but I guess you pay for what you get
I didn't buy these for sound quality, but to use with ear protecting ear muffs (large, over the ear design) while using my riding mower
The ear muffs fit over them snugly and comfortably, which has not been the case with other in-ear headphones that have a longer hard plastic neck before the flexible wire starts
These headphones does not even meet the minimum expectations you should have
They are flimsy , expensive in comparison and sound quality is average
A way better one and cheaper is this http://www
amazon
com/gp/aw/d/B003EM8008
Its stronger plays louder and when I'm finished writing this review I will be buying one again
I hope I've been helpful to you and goodbye
One side stopped working for no apparent reason after several months of light use
I purchased this headphone for my wife to listen to music
It's comfortable and great sound for the price I paid
Because of the price I thought they weren't going to be good headphones, but i like them, they are loud enough for me
These are fair earbuds for the price
They are very comfortable for my ears, and stay in the ear nicely with how i wear them with the wire going up and over the top of my ear
I'm not picky about my earbuds and can't really say much on the finer points of sound quality, but I feel very satisfied with what I hear
My last pair fell apart after about 15 months of daily use - I started losing audio in one ear intermittently, and then one bud just fell to pieces one day
I have purchased a replacement pair of the same kind, and feel like $10 is a good deal for another 15 months
product was as described
STANDARD
great product, just what i expected
Good product
Great bass from these earphones
My right earbud just blew out, but I love these earphones so much im buying another pair
I have mixed feelings about these headphones
I picked a pair of these up because I didn't want to use my Denon AH-C551 as my daily driver when I commute back and forth from work since the cable is way too long and would get caught all over the place
I looked for an alternative and ended up picking up  a pair of the EX10's Mid March since I had a gift card and the price was reasonable
I used them mon-friday about 2 hours each day mainly during my commute
It's now August 5th and it has lost sound on the left ear bud
It lasted about 5 months give or take
I didn't abuse these and when not in use I put them in a small pouch inside my backpack so that it doesn't get crushed or tangled
Now is this normal
earbuds lasting about half a month
I'm guessing maybe that's the reason why these come with only a 90 day warranty
I always thought most new electronics came with a 1 year warranty
Anyhow, these for the price sound pretty good
As long as your ears are sealed with the earbuds you'll get plenty of bass too
I had no problems with the sound quality from google music using these ear buds and sounded way better than what came with my phone
The biggest negative for me is that these don't last
Only has a 90 day warranty from Sony
That's not really standing by their product
Granted it's about 10-15 bucks
Biggest positive would be that it's inexpensive and sound is noticeably better than oems that come included with the phone
these are also light and comfortable
Would I get another pair of these
I'm not sure
I certainly wouldn't pickup just one if I were to repurchase I'd get a backup pair as a just in case
If not I'd probably spend a bit more and get a better set of buds
a bargain
I purchased these on vacation when my old earbuds broke
They were very affordable so I gave them a shot
I mix sound and use a pair of $300 Sennheiser studio headphones so it takes a lot for
earbuds to impress me
The sound quality of these earbuds was superb
Rich powerful bass, bright highs and crisp vocals
My advise
is throw away your Skullcandy and don't waste money to buy Beats
These are awesome not just for the price but because they sound great
I've had mine for two years now with no problems and use them every day
My wife really liked these just fine
However, she loved the Panasonic RPHJE120D's I bought in the same price range and replaced them immediately
They are not bad at all, but there are definitively better in-ear products in this price range
i had a pair previously that lasted quite a while, I just ordered a new pair,  this pair was not good, just a few days after I started using it the right ear bud just stopped working
I am going to go back to headphones
I expected them to last a bit longer than 2 months
There's no sound in one of the headphones :(
love em
For the money these are hard to beat
They isolate noise quite well, I use them riding atv's and snowmobiles
They don't protrude out from your ears, much so you can wear a helmet with them
I'm pretty hard on them, but they hold up very well
First pair I had lasted about 5 years, but I tore the wires off on something, I just don't remember what
These also don't have any vent holes so you don't get air noise through them like some others
This is great if you ride an atv without a helmet
Oh, and I think they sound great too
I don't know what others are talking about when they say they don't have much bass
Mine have always sounded great with my Sansa Clip
Love this gadget
Stay in my ears much better and the sound is great
Carry them with me wherever I go
I recommend these earbuds to any and everybody who likes hands free communication or listening to your favorite music while you exercise
Package was opened and one earbud did not work
Good and surprisingly more robust than some other expensive ones
Awesome, service was great and the product is just excellent
These are holding up super well despite constantly snagging them on barbells, getting them yanked out by my dogs, dropping my phone and pulling it back up by the cord, etc
For the price, they have great sound and are seemingly very durable
I am always losing the little rubber things but these came with extra and somehow I've not managed to lose any of them yet
I have tiny ears and they fit snugly and don't fall out no matter how much I sweat
Exactly what we needed
break within a week
What can I say- they're headphones- they work well
good for 6 months then stopped working
Love them over the standard ipod headphones
Great for the gym
great thank you, also sonamp3 love it
I won't complain that they broke, I've had this product before and I know they don't last long
If your looking for something durable, these aren't it
If your looking for headphones that are cheap and have decent sound go ahead and get them
Went out in s month
Left earbud stopped working after a week and a half
The last time I bought the headphones, they worked for a greater part of the year
It was really disappointing to see one of my favorite and simple headphones break so quickly
However, the sound quality was good while it lasted
I love em
As good as bose and a lot cheaper
bad
These sounded really good but after a couple weeks the left ear bud broke
it works
good job thanx
I've had a few pairs of these and I considered them good quality until
the one I have now has only one ear working
the left one stopped working shortly after my second use
Since they are considered a little bit more pricier than other earphones, I won't buy these anymore
Incredibly disappointed
I like the fact that these ear buds block out most of the ambient noise (not sure how they compare to noise canceling or noise isolating ear buds)
So far, the sound in general has been crisp, the bass has been deep, and the highs clear
The cord seems to be quite thin, and easily breakable
I have no idea how long the cord will last
Overall, I would recommend these earbuds
If they broke, I would definitely get another pair
Very nice looking stereo headphones
the sony sound is really excellent
a top sound in earbud headphones
i have gone through so many that were cheaper and they sounded muffled and lower quality
these are a great price too
very very affordable
love em, will buy more
Great ear buds for the price, they are very comfortable and produce a good sound
Lasted 1 month
Only one side works
First day and theyre already messed up
The first I had was broken too fast, Hoping being lucky this time
Best ear buds I've had
Comfortable when wearing on long walks and running
Pretty good
works great
great sound and good value
I'm picky about earbuds
I find many of them uncomfortable
I like the Sony ones the best
great price and sound
They sound great and they came sooner than expected
its good
They stay in when I'm running or cycling at the gym, which means they do everything I need them to
I love Sony products
These head phones are crisp and clear
Great product
these fall out of my ears all the time
I wouldn't recommend them
Used them for about 2
5 weeks before the right ear bud stopped working
Extremely lightly used, left them sitting on my desk all the time unraveled i
e
not in a pocket or wrapped around anything
Highly disappointed with the product quality, would not recommend
These are decent headphones for their price; I've always been a fan of Sony products and am quite satisfied with these phones
good for the money
Jim Tavegia
Only 1 pair of headphones worked
Very comfortable earbuds with good quality sound, but after just about one month of use the right earbud no longer transmits sound - - completely silent
After tinkering with it for quite a bit, I think it's just defective
Makes me hesitant to buy another pair because it seems the same thing could easily happen (I've had this problem with other Sony earbuds, but after a longer period of time, at which point the cost of buying a new pair didn't matter so much)
Avoid these if you can
These are comfortable to wear for several hours, have great sound and fit well
I felt that the price made these a good value
One headphone is louder than the other other than that they work as they should
Not as good quality as my older Sony headphones of the same model
Great fit for smaller ear openings
Work great
These headphones are very durable
I wear them almost everyday whether to listen to music, watch movies/shows, or to work out in
They have a great sound quality and aren't bulky whatsoever
The only thing I'd say about this is the black casing around the jack (part where the headphones plug into my iPod) is slipping down the wire and the wiring is exposed
However, electrical tape fixed it in two minutes
I highly recommend this product
I purchased these to replace Apple's iPod Shuffle headphones, which I use for running
These are not good for running--they form a tight seal in your ear which blocked all sound and airflow, creating pressure in my head
I also thought the cord felt cheap
Sounds A lot better then all my other ones
I went back and bought another pair because my baby used it as a teethen toy
Not excellent, but great, the sound is good
I bought another's sony, and they was better than these one
Perfect for sound and comfort
Excellent product
Excellent service
Great headphones
They are comfortable and do a good job when I use them
They have a problem I haven't found an answer for
That is the entangling that takes place when they are stored
Good quality at an affordable price
Initially of a lesser quality than my old earbuds, really tinny and lacking bass, but I was able to mess around with my computer's audio settings enough to band-aid the problem
They're worth the low price for computer use if you're willing to mess with settings for 15 minutes to get the bass up to par
These ear buds stopped working after only one month, I would not buy these again
the quality of them did work great when working
The best cheap earbuds you can buy
These headphones a great if they work  they last about 2 to 3 weeks then one of the ear buds will stop working
DON'T waste your money
Good
Great value
Excellent product
Just as described
I couldn't hear out of one of the earbuds just 2 days after I opened the package
Extremely disappointed
Very nice product
I LOVE IT
This is the second pair in a row to stop working after a few months of occasional use
Once I figured was a fluke but two times suggests they are just pieces of crap
I used these three times and the left ear bud has already stopped working
Worked so far up until the point they accidentally got ran through the washer + dryer
They lasted about 3 months but i'm sure these would've lasted much longer than that
Sound quality was average
A decent set for the price
Headphones arrived one week ago, I've only used them twice and already one earbud has stopped working
That's 10$ in the trash
Loved it
Poor quality, definitely got what I paid for
They will break after a couple months
I liked the product
My roommate have the same one
This ones doesn't sound like them
They may sound nice for a while, but don't be fooled
They WILL break
All as expected
Fast shipment
Great item
sound quality --okay
Love them
I HATE THIS PIECE OF S*** IT BROKE IN ABOUT A MONTH AND I HAD TO GET NEW EARBUDS, DONT BUY THEM
I liked them
They work
Alittle ugly but thats fine as they do what they say they do
I would recommend them to anyone for a cheap ear bud
The sound is terrible, need I say more
Huge disappointment after purchasing these to replace a prior pair of Sony headphones that sounded great and lasted 5+ years
I have owned better quality headphones, but for 10 times the price of these
For the price, they are great quality headphones
One of the best values I have found
I have these at the office and keep a pair at home for traveling
Great for when my work requires me to watch video and I don't want to disturb coworkers
Music sounds good
Can't beat the price
The base in the left side speaker is completely blown, I have to have the volume turned way down just so I don't hear how horrible it sounds
Love these
Sound is wonderful, too
Like how L had a braille dot on it so you can figure which ear is what in the dark
Amazon reviews convinced me to pick these and they did good
Really great earphones for the price
The cable is kinda thin
But seems durable
Great sound quality and bass
Love them
I don't know if there's a quality issue of late, but these haven't been lasting long at all
The 1st pair I had lasted a long time, with a lot of use
Eventually, the wire just got worn, and there was intermittent sound
But like quite a few of the other recent comments have stated, my last 2 pairs have seen the right bud go out after about a month of use
Because of the price, and the fact that it's difficult for me to find buds that fit nicely (I have to use the small fittings); I pretty much like these
And I've been pleased with the sound quality as well
But it's a pain to keep having to replace them
works great, surprisingly clear quality considering the price
i initially bought it as a spare set but considering the quality i now use it as my main pair
These earbuds lasted for about 2 weeks and the the left earbud stopped working
You always get what pay for
Spend a little more
I go through ear bugs like candy
These Sony ear bugs have held up better than any I have tried and they sound great
I'm very happy with the sound quality of these headphones
Obviously, they aren't luxury ear buds with crystal clear sound, but I think they're very good for the price
Arrived defective, Right ear sounds great, left ear is whisper soft
For $10 not worth finagling with seller for replacement and associated return process/costs
Maybe a SONY problem anyway
these broke after two days the jack snapped off for no apparent reason
Would never buy these again considering they are not great for sound anyway
These are solid earbuds and I loved them at first but I've gone through 4 pairs and I'm abandoning these junk earbuds, I expected better quality from sony
First one side stops working and then the the next
Save your money and buy a more expensive and durable pair of earbuds or you'll end up with piles of earbuds across the house like I did
I really liked these earbuds
Great value, it sounds great, not very durable though when they encounter a vacuum cleaner
Good product with a nice length on the cord
I expected a good product from Sony and this is just that
One side stopped working after ~1 month of normal use
Could be an issue with the connection
Sound quality while it was working was average at best
Don't Waste your money
After six weeks of light use, the right headphone stopped working
I wouldn't buy these again as they break too fast
It is really comfortable
love the tips they fit comfortably
overall quality of sound is also good considering the price :D
They feel nice and quality seems ok, i wish i could compare sound quality too, but i could not: they came in a non-working condition
Out of the package, only the right side of the earphones worked (the left emitted no sound)
I opened the package after the factory warranty of 90 days (I didn't need it until my old pair broke), so I contacted Sony customer service
In order to get it replaced I would have to pay for a service charge (Sony representative did not know how much this would be) and the cost to ship it to the replacement factory in Texas, which would have been more than the headphones cost in the first place
Poor product, watch out
These are amazing earbuds
They were purchased to replace the ill fitting apple ipod earbuds
What makes them great is that they have a 90 degree 3
5 mm connector which has kept the wires from prematurely getting bent, broken or failing like my first replacement earbuds suffered
I've taken these things everywhere in those three years
I literally have them in my ears most of the time at work, when I run several times a week, jand even outdoors in the cold and rain
They've been dropped, tugged, smacked and handled roughly but they are bomb proof
I think I paid $15 dollars for them and they have been an amazing investment
The different earbud inserts makes it great to fit to your ear
I'm just stunned that an easily breakable item has lasted so long
After all this extreme torture test they are finally in need of replacement
One of the buds is loosing signal, but I can't blame it
I've not been gentle with these things and just used them expecting them to fail
I don't think I'll ever throw them away just to remind me what a great product they were
:)
They are better than some but not as good as others
Works for me to listen to stuff at work
I got these to replace a pair of Earbuds that were no longer consistently working
I'm very pleased
The price was great and the sound quality is excellent
For the price, they seemed like high quality headphones (and I'm not about to pay $40 for Apple Earbuds)
But after a few months of semi-regular use, one side inexplicably stopped working
A few days later, the other one went too
Yeah they're cheap, but I expected better results than that
This is the worst thing I have ever used
sure, it feels nice and everything, but the quality of this is unbelievable
It breaks like no other
This is going to be my third pair in 6 months, and I do not use this thing like toilet paper
Clearly, there are some major design flaws
I'm not really picky about sound quality, but this product was so poor, I had to say something
I ended up tossing these guys out
I just couldn't bear it
Even though these guys were incredibly cheap, I feel that they were a waste of money and time
Sony should be ashamed
These are much better than the skullkandy headphones you will normally encounter in a retail store
Sony makes wonderful cheap earbuds like these, which is great if you need something that will give you good sound for cheap
Now of course you won't be getting thumping bass, but if you get a decent enough seal, you will be decently surprised about the bass you can get from these little affordable headphones
Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase
And I will buy again if I ever need to replace one of my cheap headphones
I expected better from Sony
These headphones have a continuous background buzz that isn't there with other models
They also need an in-line volume control
The jack doesn't make adequate contact so you have to do a LOT of maneuvering to get a good feedback
Tried it on three devices and had the same issue on each
Sony's frequency range is always the highest when I look for headphones
These are my favorite ear phones model on the market
These are really good quality and a good buy
The only problem was that shortly after I bought them, they started coming apart at the joint on the wire
I work in front of a computer for 10 hrs a day
Not a fan
they hurt my ear and the sound quality is terrible
He says they block out the loudest sounds around him
They are not expensive so he's not worried if something happens to them
This is his 2nd pair
He uses them every day on the noisy buss and noisy trolley
These headphones have such great sound I feel like the singer is singing directly into my ear
I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone
These are the only ear buds I will buy
They cancel out the other noise, they have good bass and they are a great price
Love them
poor quality and box was opened, not sure if it was used before, not what I expected from a Sony product
I received Sony MDREX 10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones on time
The headphones did not have much volume when plugged in and they shortly broke and you could hear only from one side of the earphones
I've gone through three pairs of these
They sound pretty decent, but they don't seem to last that long
The most recent pair stopped working in the right ear after about 2 weeks
I bought 2 pairs and they both lost sound in one ear after very little use
They seem to be of the poorest quality
One earbud was dead inside of a month
I use them for about 4-6 hours a day, 5 days a week while at work and they couldn't even last the first four weeks
I haven't had any problem with these
They seem very strong, becasue I have put them through the ringer and they still work
These are a great buy
but you get what you pay for
I've been through way too many expensive headphones
and just decided to get a few of these to leave in my bag, home, etc
This way I can always have in-ear headphones when I need them
The quality of sound is WAY better than I imagined for the price
But having had them for a short time,  they are starting to malfunction
But for the price
So what
LOL
They are great quality and give great sound
They are perfect for an everyday avid music listener like myself
Amazing
Used these once while exercising
I went to use them again and they had stopped working
I would contact seller to have them replaced, but resolved to use other headphones for the future
I bought these mainly to use while mowing my lawn
I didn't want to risk damaging my good Sennheiser over the ear headphones so I looked for a cheap earbud instead
I'm not going to compare them to my Sennheisers, because they're completely different headphones
My first problem with these earbuds is that the cord is not long enough
I'm 6'3" and they barely reach the side pocket of my work shorts
I can move my phone to my front pocket and that helps a little, but this isn't my preferred place for my phone
My second problem with these earbuds is that they're just not loud enough
I wear them to drown out the drone of my lawnmower and they don't do a good job of that
I gave these earbuds 3 stars because they were cheap and while I wasn't expecting much, I did expect better
One plus is that they aren't very loud so I don't worry about them causing ear damage to my 9 year old daughter when she's listening to Kids Bop on her IPod
I was intent on ordering a different brand based on recommendations and reviews from Amazon
I got these at a local store and actually prefer them to my original
They're not incredibly bassy, but they're the most transparent sounding earphones I've heard in a long time, and after listening to some other bass-enhanced 'phones, I think I prefer these more
I'd give it five stars if I had them longer, but I can't comment yet on durability
Thes are exactly what I expected
They are a great buy for the money
I would recommend them for casual listening
This product comes with replaceable rubber pieces to customize the fit, which is great because many other competitive products don't fit my ear well
Great price for very good sound
Nice for I-Pods, laptops, phones, and any other portable devices
Lightweight, and the lack of volume control is no big deal
Have ordered twice and happy with purchase
Keep in several spots for easy finding when I need them
Good reproduction and while these are not top line these are the best I've found for the $ spent
Will purchase again
Like others have mentioned, these quit on you, just about 30 days after you buy them, in just one ear
I've now owned two pairs of these headphones to keep at my desk at work and plug into my phone/tablet while working
Maybe on average used 3-4 hours a day
With each pair, the right side has quit working
The first pair, the audio just got more and more faint
The second pair, just today, I was listening to a podcast, paused it, walked away and came back and nothing out of the right side
100% dead
Nada
Yes, they're cheap, because I don't want to keep expensive buds or cans at work
But I don't think I should be replacing them on a montly basis either as if they're disposable
Sony, such a disappointment
I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
THESE ARE WELL WORTH THE MONEY AND WORK GREAT
I USE THEM ON MY BIKE RIDE EVERY DAY AND THEY SEEM TO WITHSTAND THE OCCASIONAL ACCIDENTAL PULLS
No reliable at all
Look for something else
There are good deals in the same price
Apple headphones are clearly superior to Sony's
With todays smart phones it's nice having volume control on the headphone cord
These not only lack that feature but they aren't very loud at full volume they are still a bit too quiet
I wish I had just spent more and got some nicer ones
I bought these earbuds about a week ago and they came broken after about a week of usage neither of the buds let out any music
I thought that I could trust Sony to give me a good and trusting product but that did not happen
I had previously bought a pair of white ones for listening to music at work
I bought that pair in early 2012 and they are still kicking
I enjoyed the white pair so much i had to buy another pair so i bought black for at the gym so they don't turn gray over time from sweat
I have used many different ear-buds in the past but they all seem to die in under a year so for this pair to last over 2 years and still work perfect is unbelievable for me
I really enjoy the simplicity of these
They are short that they do not bother your ears one bit
Other brands are too big or long and will rub against your ear causing irritation
They also sound great for ear-buds and for $10 are you kidding me
My dad has a pair of the Bose in-ear headphones for like $100 and I can barely tell the difference not to mention if i lose these on an airplane i wont cry for a week
Seriously all i can say is BUY THESE NOW
There is always a chance with any product that you will get a dud but remember that Amazon has a superb return policy
I paid only $8
98 for these Sony earbuds here at Amazon and I must say the sound is big, bass is damn fine, and there are three sizes of silicone earpieces so it will fit all ears
For the price, these earbuds can't be beat
There are more expensive earbuds, but I'm a poor girl and quite frankly I feel I got the best earbuds in the world for only $8
98
What can I say
They are Sony, they are perfect length
So many are to short
I use them while working every day and I don't have any issue with my head being jarred when I turn my head or anything
I've had that issue with so many other pairs
They seem long enough where I can turn around, move to my trash can, the other side of my desk, etc
I hook them right into my monitor on my desk
They do seem to really suction in my ears and I really can't hear anything at all going on around me
These are as good or better then some of the more expensive ones I've bought
Don't waste your money on more expensive ones
These are great quality
looks cheap but sound quality is good
good for the people who needs small ear buds
will not last longer
I used it for one mouth stopped working in the right one, at the base of it the wire started to come out of it, i will not be buy them again
for the price and size, the headphones deliver great quality sound, including high and low octaves
A great upgrade for headphones included with your smart phone or other music playing device, without the premium 3 figure price tag
These are great to help time pass at the gym
They've got good clarity, are comfortable, and aren't too expensive
My son ordered these
He said the sound was great
He was very pleased with this product
I guess it would help if he could keep them from going through the wash
I purchased two of these 2 year ago for mothers day and they still sound like the first time
You cant go wrong with these its a must, especially when cheap headphones like skull candy don't do it
if your headphones constantly brake or spontaneously lose the sound on one side this is the product for you
These are amazing quality you wont regret
He bought a way more expensive brand before and after those stopped working, I was very happy he picked such a cheap alternative
They must work just fine because he has never complained
This is the second pair we get
They're cheap so they won't last forever but will last long enough to not feel badly about having to replace them
My son uses these ear phones on the bus to and from school
I know they are cheap, but they broke so quickly that it was a total waste of money
The wire pulled right off the end
Nice, the color hides it when I am at work
:)I will consider to purchase more, it has great sounds and base and it camouflages when I use it at work
They worked great for 4 months that I owned them, and then the right ear bud went dead
I guess that's what I get for buying cheap headphones
these were really good ear buds when i first got tem but after a while the left earbud broke so yeah they don't last too long
Being a Sony aficionado all my life, I can only but accept its decline
This earphones just suck
I have another from Samsung and the difference is just abismal
Well good enough for the giant fallen
Live the new
These ear buds provide a pretty good quality sound reproduction
I have a set of Bose over-the-ear headphones which produce a very good sound quality, but they get uncomfortable after awhile
These ear buds fit pretty well and are fairly comfortable
Have not yet tried them on a flight
My Bose are not sound-deadening and the airplane noise is quite noticeable
light use and theyre already trash, right side went out for no apparent reason
i used them maybe once or twice a week, no more than 10 times
complete garbage
these are trash
do not buy these
I typically go through a set of ear buds about every 6 months
I keep them at my work desk and use them to listen to music or pod casts while I work
These ear buds fit my ears very well and the sound quality is good
We will see how long they last
I wanted a pair of earbuds to take to the gym so I could listen to podcasts while I work out
These are plenty loud enough, and sound pretty good
They also come with extra ear-rubber things to fit in your ear, in case you have small or large ear canals
(I loved this because I use a medium in my left ear and a large in my right
)I can't speak to the music quality, but for podcasts these work fine
I've had them for two weeks so far
Ordered for my wife and she really likes them
Listens to her baseball team on her little radio and loves the ear buds
I have bought two of these in the last year
On both sets, the right earphone slowly dies until it is completely dead
Not the old Sony I used to know
I bought them because i needed a new pair and i didn't have the money to buy a fancy ones, but instead how cheap they are, their sound is just great
The cord is thin and you think you'll break them in a week but nope, they are quite good
Served their purpose as a gym headphone
They were extremely cheap near Christmas
I would recommend to any non audiophile looking for some basic-inexpensive headphones
These Sony's are very clear
For those that want to compare them to Beats or Skullz, for under $10, you really can't go wrong
I used to order Sony's "Sweet Little Buds" but they have been discontinued and these are apparently the replacement
The sound quality is really pretty good for the money
For less than $10 you really can't complain
I really have a problem with the way these fit
They are just a little too big for my ear canal, making me feel like they are going to pop out most of the time
Even using the smallest of the earbuds, they aren't comfortable
I'm very reckless with my headphones
Tons of them had wiring break, and sound stopped, or one of them stops working suddenly
But these are wonderful
They wrestle in my pockets, bend at unreasonable angles, and transition from below zero to room temperature just fine
I've only ever had a problem with the wiring once, and I lost my last ones because I accidentally decapitated the left one when it got caught on the door while running out of the house really fast
The quality is great for what you pay
I'm not much of an audiophile, and don't know much of the vocab, but I'm very satisfied
I've bought these three times; I just keep coming back
I bought it because price was so reasonable and it really proved my expectations
good quality and sound
totally love it
Inexpensive, reliable earbuds
Fit just fine and no need to spend more money on goofy bright colored ones, standard little headphones
Well, it was fine until one of the earphones, the right side, died
We all know we can't just use one side or it will throw you off balance, especially if you use this while you're running or working out on machines at the gym
I had to throw it out
Waste of money
I expected a lot better from Sony
4th pair within a year you  might ask
Is this guy a masochist
Well,  i think is only fair that I go buy new ones &  return the old ones instead of dealing with an inconvenient warranty claim
They sound like $15 Earbuds
I gave two stars because how comfortable they are
On the scale of 0-5
a 2 in sound,  1 in construction,  5 in comfort
I wouldn't expect bose,  yamaha,  okio sound,
But again their durability left much to be desired
Pass not a buy
I usually have good experiences with sony products, but I purchased these in February of 2014 and they were broken by mid April of 2014
One ear started to sound muffled and distorted, then stopped working altogether
I regret purchasing this product
The headphones only worked well for few weeks then one side of the earphones broken
Meaning it's not balance the sound well
For the price of these you can't beat 'em
I've had 3 other pairs, this one my husband uses
He hasn't complained so I'm guessing he likes them
He uses them at the gym, lifting and running
They seem to do their job just fine
(mine do, which is why I got him these)
Provide good sound, however get too much rubbing noise through the cable regardless of any activity i'm doing
Recommend other options if you are active and would rather here music than "whoosh" sounds when you move
I like these earphones because they are durable and don't come out of the ear easily
I would definitely purchase them again
Didn't work right from the start
All trebbile, no base
Sounded like the chipmunks
The free ones from the library had a much better sound quality and fit
Great for most phones, a kindle, and other devices
this is a great product that I would reorder if I needed a new one
Great price but the sound quality wasn't what I was looking for, maybe I just got a bad pair, but the right side want as loud as the left side and it bothered me greatly, but still a decent pair of earphones
Bought these new ear buds for my 16 year old granddaughter and she loves them
As a young woman of color, she really appreciates them blending into her hair and body color - versus the stark white ones that stand out
I have a pair and love the soft plastic earpieces - I often forget I have them in
The price was $5 less than our local store and we received them in 2 days
can't beat the price for the performance small compact and can be worn under ear muffs very strong construction and light weight
They came in with the outer shell of the right headphone cracked even though the packaging was intact and sound only comes out of the left side
I know these were cheap but I expected better
Honestly, I would like either a refund or a new set of headphones because the ones I got were broken and defective
they lasted for a while and are pretty cheap
i always buy headphones online
its the easiest way to get quality ones, plus you cant go wrong with sony
I use to buy this earphone in Walmart, they worked just fine, not bad quality but a bit too pricey at 15 dollars, they went out after 9-10 months which I find reasonable
I decided to order the same ones from amazon, because of the prime shipping thinking they were the same but it wasn't at all
These earphones are defective, only the right ear phone is louder than the left
It makes the sound experience very one sided rather than complete on both ears
very bad buy, I think they are sending only defective earphones
Do not buy this
I thought the earphones would be more sturdy than they are
They hurt the inner part of my ear and it is hard to keep them in place
It is especially difficult when I'm running
The description of the product made it seem like they were ideal, but they were not
These were a replacement for the Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphones that died about a year and a half of use
I used these for about a month, when both sides completely stopped working
The sound quality is all right, and the cord is a bit thin
One side stopped working completely after about two weeks, then the other side died a few weeks later (note that I take good care of my earphones/headphones)
My recommendation: Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear HeadphonesThese earphones beat these cheap Sony earphones by a mile, AND they're cheaper
I would not recommend this product to anyone
MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones  - The quality is excellent especially for the low price
The headphone dosent slip out during running,Noice cancelling is great when i very noisy environments
One of the buds no longer works after two months of use
Can't return it past the 30 day window
Because I really like them and they have good sound quality, and last a really long time, really love them
I really have no idea why this babe broken in only 3 month
I always be so nice to my ear headphones (my last one lasts for 4 years
)
I'm an earbuds kind of person, and I don't like spending a lot of $$$ on headphones
These work great, fit comfortably inside my ears, and are well priced
Nothing groundbreaking here, but a solid sound repro experience
I bought this headphones around a month back, and I am very satisfied with its quality
Design is really good, comes with extra ear-buds of different sizes, and the most important is
sound quality is really good (I mean compared to other ones in this price range)
The only thing it lacks is microphone, which would have made it
the best combination
But still I love it
They worked great for the one day I had them
Don't leave in your pocket and let your wife put them in the washing machine
They no longer work at all
Under technical, it says microphone, but there is not one
Very dissapointed in this because it was the only reason I bought them
I specified that I wanted to order a brand NEW pair of headphones paying a few dollars more than the "used-like new" ones
When I received the item it came in what looked like new but the package was open at the top and the right headphone was blown out
I'm not upset about the price, just upset that they shippend me a used item when I ordered a new one
Update:  We got these on the March 15, 2014 and had to get them ready for return on April 5, 2014 because the left side earbud stopped working
My 17 yr old is happy with these headphones and likes the fact they ship with different size ear pieces because she needed the small size
She says they sound good and that says a lot coming from her
The earbuds also come with a 90 day limited warranty
These headphones put out great sound and also stay put in your ears unlike the other kinds of headphones that you stick in your ears
They are also very comfortable
not enough bass but its ok for now and the wire doesn't make that static noise when rubbing against your clothes
Fluid and with quality, fit and sound in the ears, good headset for the suggested retail price
My brother liked it
I've bought 2 sets of these now, one for home, one for work
They're awesome
They come with 3 different sized buds that can be interchanged, the cord is maybe 4' long
It's thin, it wouldn't hold up to a lot of tugging or anything like that, but I work a desk job, so these are great for the price
They produce enough (but definitely not an over abundance of) bass and seem to sound really clear
They're very comfortable in the ear, and the left one even has a little nubbin so that you can tell which is which without having to look at the "L" and "R" printed on them
They didn't give me a good headphones
It was not working and it came n a plastic cover
It didn't have factory sealing or warranty card or even ear buds
Not work well, just listening for headset
pretty bad product, I'm sure the headphones are not branded sony
the volume in the headphones diminishes with passing seconds
I love these and my daughter loves them too
She prefers eating the rubber ear pieces off of them instead of listening through them but hey, to each their own and you can order more ear cushions for cheap on amazon
Good price and good quality
I use these at work and have no complaints
I'd recommend these if you need some basic earphones
I love the sound on these headphones
It is crisp, clean, and loud
I've had these for a few months now without any issues
They come with different size rubber buds which is great
They can sometimes get irritating in your ears but I haven't found a pair of earbuds that hasn't done that to my ears yet
For this price, I would definitely recommend these earbuds
I've bought 4 pairs of these headphones sound great and have good bass
My only gripe is that the 3rd pair I got broke after a couple weeks
The wires came out of the insulation where it connects to the jack and only worked if you held them in the right spot
All my other pairs lasted me much longer though
Always can use a backup set so I bought one of the best ones on the market
Can not wait for the ridding  season to begin, ridding in a state of Bliss
its good but when put it heat the earbuds wont work
but they are still good with bass good must buy
I very much enjoy these and have purchased them multiples times in the past since my kids always run off with mine
Highly recommended
My 13 year old enjoys these for a couple of months and then they quit working
At first the sound was great, she liked them but when they stop working after only a couple of months I have to say they aren't that great
crappy
the cord got messed up after 4 weeks and the quality of the sound suffered
If they lasted longer then they'd be good
The cable, however, seems bound and determined to curl up and tangle itself no matter how much time I leave them hanging (my preferred method of straightening cables)
I'm thinking about ironing it because it's just that annoying
These aren't going to blow you away but they are decent headphones and about as good as it gets at this price point
If you have a tendency to lose or break headphones, these are a great choice
I was a little disappointed in these headsets
I found the sound quality wasn't very good
I was expecting better sound from a Sony
Csn fit these into the ear tightly so they stay in
I have small ear canals too
Quality is ok
Stopped working after one week's use, terrible quality
Amazing value and the buds feel so comfortable in my ears
These are great, and I may just get a second pair as a backup for my drawer in the office
i had these same headphones in black before and comparatively these white ones have a stiffer cord and tinnier sound, but theyre still decent
I use these at work, it keeps the noise from others around me out and I only hear the music
They are comfortable to wear all day long
I thought these head phones would be like all the other head phones but they are not they actually work really well
These broke after about a month of periodic use while at the gym
I expected something longer last even for the 15 dollars I paid at walmart
Great fit and sound
Doesn't fall out while doing strenuous activity and solidly built
Can't go wrong with these Sony buds
Excellent sound quality in these
My last two purchases were JLab and Panasonic, in a similar price range, and I ended up throwing them away since I had to cut up the packaging to actually try them out and couldn't return them
Broke after 2 days of use
Very cheap quality
I thought Sony would have at least made a slightly better product, but they didn't
I went running with these maybe 5 times and then the left ear piece stopped working
will not be buying this model again
I have many pairs of these earbuds
For the price you can't go wrong, they are sturdy and they sound great
I bought this for my husband and he loved the gift
But didn't work for a week too and ended up in garbage
I use these when I work out and the sound quality is good and they stay in my ears really well
I bought a pair of these at Best Buy
I'm not a sound connoiseur, but for basic music needs, this is probably a good pair
The purchase came with different sets of rubber buds
The default was a "medium" size as pictured
There were also small and large sizes
The only cavet I've had with these is that the rubber buds seem to fall off the earphones
I've actually lost the medium and small sets because of this, and am forced to use the large set
The large sets are fine, but because they're too big for my ears, they tend to slip out
These lasted me for a year and a half
these darn headphones stopped working after 3 weeks never buying them again
It was a waste of my money and I am not at all happy
just saying these headphones last for ever
I had the same headphone set for a year now and its amazing
Sound is great and same for quality
I recommend this headphones
its the best out there for only 10 dollars
These were cheaply made and have bad sound quality
Invest in something better not this crap
They broke within a month
The music sounds great, but the left one stopped working slightly after 6 months
That was fixed buy adjusting earphone sound in my Settings (I have the iPod 4), but then the other stopped working completely the month after
and then it just stopped working completely
I have been a huge fan of these headphones because of the sound you get for the price
However, I do want to point out that these headphones will very quickly stop working because the cable connection to the ear bud easily can came loose
I would go running with this headphones and one accidental tug and I found myself with one ear bud no longer working
If you are an active person that may tug on on the cable dont buy these and spend more for higher end headphones
If you are just a casual listener that will use these while being inactive these are great headphones for you as they do carry great sound
Ordered a pair as a cheap way to get the buds to use with my other more expensive sony earbuds
I still tried them before, and the right side wasn't working
Now that I lost my more expensive pair, I decided to give these another go and order them again
And once again, the right side is lower than the left straight out of the box
Don't buy one of these, save yourself the gamble and get a more expensive model
I bought a pair of these earbuds and it lasted me for like 8 months and then it randomly broke one day
So I decided to replace them since they work pretty well sound wise
Probably used the new pair for about 2 months and it randomly broke on me AGAIN
Just as midterms were around the corner so I was not too please about that
I wish the seller would replace them
I love them they do a great job but it's so s***ty how they break down so quickly
As described and we haven't had any problems
Ordered for my parents and they haven't had any issues or complaints about the fit
As then title suggests, one of the sides died with less than 1 month of use
Actually bought 2 of these since the price seemed certainly cheap - same thing happened to both the headphones
Excellent and high quality Ear-Headphones
I'm very pleased with this product
I have and will recommend and purchase them again
When this product first arrived, it worked really well
The bass was great for an earbud and the aesthetic quality was also top notch
However, after about a week of use, the right earbud stopped working entirely
Normally this is something I'd expect over months of use as the wires become threadbare
In this case, the earbuds look perfectly fine from the outside, no damage to the wire, no water damage, nothing
This is undoubtedly an issue with the interior quality of the product
I will not buy this product again, this is very disappointing
s*** dont ever buy them they break super easily
if you would like to waste your money then by all means buy these pieces of s***
I needed a pair of phones just for my ipod while for the gym
It's only an hour and half workout so nothing crazy or long
Because of the price I purchased two
Both lasted two days before one of the speakers went out
So basically, for what you spend, they're good for about 3 hours
I'll continue to purchase Sony TVs but they need to get out of the headphone market
I just shipped my earphones back
Only one worked properly
I got 2 pairs of ear buds and only one pair matched
Very upset with what I got
great inexpensive headphones that sound great
, they dont fall out of your ears
i always need back up head phones, so the three that comes in a bundle, you cant go wrong
Stops working after 2 months
Very cheap quality
I will not buy them again
Otherwise sound quality was fine
Just ok
I have been doing audio production for 30 years and own seven sets of headphones ($14 to $220)
These are my first earbuds
I needed something to listen to while my head was on a pillow during long sessions of dialysis
Most important -- they sound great
Transients are fine, everything is clear and undistorted
Sony's choice of 16 Ohms was reasonable and right
(Most complaints here are caused by people not shoving them all the way into their ears and/or crappy crappy MP3 files and/or "more bass is better bass" and/or impedance issues
)  When I played high quality music recordings ((Steely Dan, Olivier Messiaen, and some recordings that I made myself) through a CD player, a minidisc player and a Sandisc Clip+ the Sony earbuds sounded great
*The wires are rather thin, and they are only as good as they need to be
They are actually thinner than the picture on Amazon
Though the rubber ear things seal you in pretty good, I guess it is the nature of earbuds that they are easy to pull out of your ear when you tug on the wires
The little slider helps some
I really like that they come in three sizes
And, they are pillow friendly
(I would rather use open-air headphones on a walk, as I would like to hear cars, buses, people, dogs, birds, and the like
)My one-day impression is 4-star
If anything untoward develops, I'll let you know
* I was not obsessive enough to do frequency tests
The ear-buds arrived packaged properly
Upon first test run, the left ear bud was non-functional
Immediately scheduled a return
I am going to try a different brand
Really impressed by the sound quality for the low price
I prefer this sound to the stock iPhone headphones and definitely prefer it to any other headphone in the price range
When I first got them I had to try the different ear pieces but once I found the right fit they were snug in my ears and I could go running with them without them falling out
The biggest downfall of these headphones is the build quality
My first pair lasted 3 or 4 months before one ear stopped working
Got another pair, those lasted 4 and a half months then the same issue happened
I've decided now to spend a little more money on some sturdier iems
This is the second set I've owned
The first set's cord separated from the plug from wear and tear
I like that they come with several sized ear cushions to best fit my ear
They are comfortable in my ear--the cushions are just that---cushions---without compromising sound, in my opinion
I didn't want to spend a lot on ear phones, yet wanted comfortable ones with decent sound quality
These deliver all I need
Definitely the best pair of headphones I have purchased for under 10 bucks
I live in Minnesota and my old Passonic  earphones froze when it was cold out but these do not
These even have the connector thing that prevents knots
Great buy
definitely worth the money
These are a lot better than the cheap headphones I bought with my favorite NFL teams logo
They work very well and were worth the price
Let's put it this way: my ears are weirdly shaped and this earphones are the ones that fit me best
Plus the sound is of the quality you'd expect from Sony
This said, they break easily (usually one of them stops working), but for their price it is worth buying a new pair again
The last ones I bought broke after 7 weeks of use
I have ordered a pair of these earphones before and they were amazing with the sound quality
However I have it a 4 star rating because when I received these white ones the right side started malfunctioning
It would play music and then cut off and on again
I'm very careful about my earphones so I know I haven't done anything to break them or ruin it
The fit is good and include multiple sizes of rubber buds but the quality of the earphones is pretty low
My left bud never worked and I was too lazy to send them back
These are by far the best headphones I have ever purchased and they were not expensive at all
I received Beats headphones as a gift and these are just as good if not better because the size is less restrictive
The quality is fantastic and they are comfortable
I have never used in-ear headphones before and I thought they would feel awkward but they do not at all
I highly recommend them
Why can't anyone make an ear bud that lasts anymore
5 days, 4 total uses
They sounded great those few times I used them
But the right bud stopped working after 5 days
No great sound quality can justify that short a lifespan
Broke quickly, but not before the return time had passed
What happened, Sony
Broke quickly, but not before the return time had passed
What happened, Sony
Given to my son-in -law as a Christmas gift
Was glad to receive it
Had one previously
Very happy with it
i can use it for like a month, then the left side broke
still it quality is suit the prize
comfortable and has extra ear pieces in case if your ear holes are small or big, you dont even need to use a bass boost when you use them
My husband loves these new Sony headphones, for the price the sound quality is really good
The bass is ok, but I am not going to complain because of how much I paid
They do the job
I don't love them
But, like I said, they do the job I bought them for
Nothing much to be said
Great product for an unbelievable price
If you are looking entry level headphones that are spectacular but provide punchy bass look no further
From the description and Sony's reputation I had expected an excellent product
I compared it with several other ear buds and there was a marked difference in the sound quality
These ear buds had a tinny sound
I ended up returning these
The sound's not too bad but whenever you take them out of your ears the rubber pads turn inside out
it was good at first it also canceled a lot of noises but then after 2 weeks my right ear bud stopped working
This is my second pair that I have owned
My first pair, I had lost after having for a verryyy long time with no problems
However, this one in particular, the left bud went out within a year of regular use
Other than that, they are very good ear buds with great sound quality
these ear buds were finally a suitable upgrade for my 16 year old daughter
She actually uses them when listening to her ipod
I recently purchased this item, and after only a month
The left ear speaker blew out
I wouldn't recommend this item to anybody
Here we go again
I have tried design, color and cases but earbuds just don't have a long life in this environment
For stereo sound and comfort, these are terrific
especially for the price
Yes, I found a different style case and hope for the best
These are so very comfortable with terrific sound quality
Product and service were perfect; I just don't like sticking these things in my ears
Product and service were perfect; I just don't like sticking these things in my ears
I like this product
I've used it before and I prefer them over others
The product is cheap, yet comfortable and sounds fantastic
Past purchases of this product have fallen apart, primarily where the wire meets the plug
To solve this, I have decided to glue this in to place
The product is honestly worth the trouble of gluing together
As for the delivery, it was amazingly fast
A day ahead of the predicted date and instant response to the order
The package, however, had the cardboard dangling from the plastic, as though the glue no longer held the plastic and cardboard together
I'm currently using the headphones and I love them
I highly recommend them to anyone looking for an affordable pair of headphones with remarkable product quality
Not bad, but I expected a better sound
I had a similar pair of headphones, I bought almost 10 years ago, earbuds were a newer deal back then
They had a phenomenal sound
I lost one of the earbuds and figured I would get a new set, it turns out I am still using the 10 year old set with the buds from these earbuds
Decent sounding headphones and inexpensive but after 4 months the left one just stopped working
I can't recommend this product
poor quality product, not recommend to any one to purchase this product even made by Sony
I like to return but I lose the packing
I've loved using these headphones since they're so cheap
The sound quality is good and the earbuds fit comfortably in my ear
However, these headphones break easily; one day one of the earpieces will stop working or the sound quality will get fuzzy, and then it's only a matter of time till they break
I recommend using them as back-up ones until you decide to buy a high-quality pair
The quality isn't fantastic but they're great for $8
The right earbud has been crackling slightly at higher volumes and I got them only a month ago
Hopefully it's not a common problem
I purchased these for my son to use in his hand held games systems
They lasted 10 minutes before he declared them the worse ear buds in history
I took the comments as a typical 11 year old complaining that he didn't receive the $300 Turtle Beach head set he had asked for
They ended up in the junk drawer for a while before I found them and I have to say THESE ARE THE WORSE EAR BUDS IN THE HISTORY OF MAN KIND after attempting to use them
Allow me to clarify why these are not only terrible but infuriating
The sound is about standard for a set of ear buds for under $10, 6/10
Standard cord length and they come in numerous colors, 5/10
But where these lose points is in the overall design
They DO NOT sit in your ear as intended, instead they are constantly slipping and falling out
Often a small head movement is enough to dislodge them from optimum listening position
Simply standing up and allowing the cord to hang free is enough to send them toppling from your ears
1/10Overall I give these a 2/10
Great if you are a sniper in the field and cant move for hours
I think you could really enjoy them for under $10
Everyone else, pass on these despite the price tag
Online it seems better it really is
Im not talking only about the appearance of the product but also about sound quality
For the price, these are excellent
The sound quality far exceeds that of any other $10 earbud out there
I've owned 4 pairs of these in my lifetime
I'm a professional gardener and I wear them while working
They hold up really well for all the accidental yanks and tugs the wires get during the normal course of my day
They stay put and I do not have problems with them falling out
Eventually, one of the earbuds will go bad and I need to replace them but I usually have hundreds of hours of listening to them under almost abusive conditions before they break
My boyfriend wanted a spare pair of ear headphones to use when he runs
I purchased these for him and he loves them
I recommend this product
I got these for my husband so he could watch videos and I could watch Netflix on my Kindle at the same time
Everyone was happy
these headphones are awesome when I'm listening to my satanic speed metal, or sometimes I want to mellow out and smoke a fat one and listen to some hardcore gangsta rap, I mean you can really feel the bass shivers through your body and rattle your spine and make your head go for a spin
buy these today or you are making a huge mistake and you fail at life
The left side channel stopped working after 6 months of mild use
For the price (8
00) the sound quality was just ok, but I expected them to last a little longer
Wouldn't really recommend them for someone who listens to music a lot, they were thin on the bass, maybe for light use, perhaps as a spare
They only come with a 90 day warranty, two pairs of spare rubber ear-buds
I would not buy them again
The very first time I plugged it in (yesterday) it was immediately apparent that they don't work properly
The sound comes in and out depending on the position of the cord
I am frustrated mostly because replacement isn't an option apparently even though they arrived defective
Seems like bad customer service to me
Bought these for low price, but I knew Sony is a know brand
First month it worked great, after that, right ear stopped working, then it started working again but more quiet
After that left one gave up so only right one worked
After that they both started working again but more quiet
Every week it went more quiet and more quiet and now I turn volume on max and I can barely hear it
The wires are already detaching from the jack
I have not used it that much
The product was cheap ($8) but it should have been cheaper ($1)
The Sony MDREX10LP In-Ear headphones habe a great sound for a great price
I bought them to replace my Samsung Galaxy headphones and the Sony headphones sound so much better
I bought these earbuds three months ago and they were great
They blocked out the outside noise and were very comfortable
A few days ago however, I noticed the left earbud's sound was starting to deteriorate and then the right earbud stopped working completely
I wish they had lasted longer
You get what you pay for
I bought these for about $8
00 on sale, which is really cheap for earbuds
I've had two other pairs of these earbuds, and they both lasted me about three months each
However, when I received my newest pair, the wire pulled out of the base of the headphone jack after about a week
The plastic coating is not thoroughly attached to either end of the earbuds
If you have the money, buy better quality earbuds
If you don't, save up because these are not worth your money
I moved recently and my old Song earbuds (model MDR-EX57LP) went missing
I purchased a new pair at a local store thinking they would be just as good as the old ones
Wrong
Sony has redesigned the overall shape of the earbuds themselves
I have small ears and the result of the redesign is that these earbuds will not stay in
And this is with the smallest rubber cover in place
They constantly fall out while I am running, or even just sitting there
I am always pushing them back in and it's just hopeless
The prior design had a longer stem leading from the body of the earbud to the rubber cover
They stayed in nicely and I had the full benefit of hearing not just treble, but bass as well
With these new ones, since they won't stay in, all I hear is treble and practically zero bass
I recently found my old pair, but one of the buds has gone out since they were buried in the center console of a car for months
Looks like I'm out of luck unless they get rid of this new, horrid design
If you have small ears like me, save your money and look for a different brand
My set broke after a month of normal use and good care
These are cheap headphones, the sound quality was ok, the casing was bad, but they did work as headphones
In summary buy at your own risk
no other similarly priced headphones that I have used are even close
they are extremely comfortable and have great sound quality and durability, lasting for more than six months
Initially though it was good, not even a fortnight passed and the right ear phone doesn't give any output
The left one is okay but what am I going to do with only one ear phone working
Disappointed
Wont recommend anyone
I expected a cheap pair of reliable "get what u pay for" ear buds
I am a big fan of Sony products, but I never expected for the right bud to crap out 2 days after I bought em'
I already have AN "EARBUD" that my grampa gave me with an old transister radio in a leather pouch back in 1972
and yes it still works
so Sony:  this is unsatisfactory
I understand that headphone durability all depends on how good you take care of them, especially how you wrap them, but less than a month
That's awful
Ever since I'd lost my Apple buds I've had a revolving door of others
Generally, my opinions are based on a few specific criteria
First, you don't have to be an "audiophile" to appreciate or recognize "good-sounding" music, so
how do they sound
Second, how do they hold up during activity
Lastly, can I keep them in for more than an hour comfortably
Oddly enough, the reason I've chosen to write this review is because I've since found my Apple buds
and am SHOCKED by how much better they sound than all the other cheapies I've tried, including these from Sony
Now, the Apple buds are by no means more comfortable than any of the in-ear iterations I've been dabbling through, and I find them nearly impossible to keep in my ears when I'm running
But goodness gracious, they sound so much better
My dad always told me that you can judge the power of a sound system not by how well it sounds at high volume, but how well you can hear the balance at very low volumes
In this case, if I make a simple comparison between the Apple buds and the Sonys, I nearly have to crank the volume on the Sonys to get much of any low-end response
The Apples, on the other hand, require much less "power" for balanced listening
To sum it all up, I've found a solid niche for these Sony earbuds
Although they are lacking in sound quality, they are superior in fit, comfort, weight, and ease of use during periods of activity
If you want earbuds that sound good, spend more money
seriously
If you want earbuds that are capable of playing music, fit comfortably, and that you can abuse guilt-free
these are the ones for you
Earbuds were very comfortable
Not to large fix very nicely in my ear
Price was reasonable for the product
Enjoyed
Worth the money, great sound, I have owned many sony headphones and have never been disappointed
They fit great
These are great sound quality for the price
Better than more expensive ones and they fit perfectly and comfortably in the ear
I BOUGHT 2 SET OF Sony MDREX10LP/WHI In-Ear Headphones , SHIPMENT WAS GREAT ON TIMESOUND IS OK
PRICE WAS BET HIGH
I ordered these and the JBuds to compare the two
These sound much better than the JBuds, with decent bass
They look flimsy, cord is quite thin, but you can't expect much for such a low price
Everything else looks good
Good fit in the ear and does block outside nose
Cable is plenty long enough for computer or iPad use
I bought 3 of these and two failed within a week
Both had one side stop working
My son unknowingly bought yet another pair
Exact same problem
One side stopped working
Hard to believe these are Sony products
Well worth the price for this product
Perfect for in the gym, I've also used them while riding in military aircraft (under a pair of peltors) and walking around campus
They last about a year or two with proper care (the cords are thin and can be pulled from the ear bud if not properly cared for) before you decide to get a new pair
I go through lots of ear buds and bought these to support my music habit
They fit my ears nicely and the sound is comparable to the $129 pair I bought before it went through the washer and dryer
Earphone cables feel really cheap almost like they were made with glue and the bass I expected wasnt there
Overall it has good quality sound
You can focus on your music without other outside sound interrupting
Great for when you want to ignore everyone
So cool for the price
i love this headphones because quality and responds
bass and high are very well
100% recommended for all you guys
go for it
These were awful
I purchased these "new" and the right headphone did not even work
What a waste of money
Sony should check this product, 2 ordered 2 and returned 2 since one side did not work at all
Normally Sony makes great stuff, this product just did not work out
I'm not an audiophile, but I know what good headphones/earbuds sound like
These definitely won't match a good pair of headphones, such as M50's or DJ1Pros, but they are good for just in general listening, such as when you're walking to class
The other benefit to these is that they are so, sooooo cheap
I lost my pair within a week, and although I feel a little bad, it's nowhere as bad as losing a set of Klipsch S4s or something
I'd definitely pick this set up again, any day, all day, every- yeah, it's good
Buy them
Outstanding value and Excellent Quality
This product conforms to standards and it is a product of integrity with durability to sustain performance
Great price, super comfortable, and excellent sound
BUT, the build quality is horrendous
I bought two pairs for myself and 2 pairs for my girlfriend so we could leave them in our offices/home/etc
All 4 pairs have died in the 6 months that I've had them They show no outward signs of damage, but one earbud has failed on all 4 pairs
They are stored safely, not overcoiled, stressed, pulled, or crushed in anyway, but yet, they have all failed
I'm doing the rounds reviewing all my christmas gadgets and this is the easiest one to write
I love that Sony headphones just work so damn well
With Sony headphones I never feel I'm paying for the brand, I feel I'm paying for the quality and the engineering
When I look at and importantly listen to, all the fancy new fashion brand headphones on the market, i just think the price is all about paying for the marketing that went into it (Dre beats I'm looking at you)
The quality certainly isn't there
I have a range of Sony headphones for different uses and they're all great
MDR1 for listening at my desk
these MDREX for the gym
they're all just great
I deviated and went for a top of the line sennheiser once
regretted it and returned them
stick with Sony peeps
I've had a pair of these ear headphones before and it lasted almost a year
I work out at least 4-5 days a week
Very durable
Cheap headphone
Cant beat the price
To me this headphone does its job and its disposable if something happens to it
Bought this for my sister after owning a pair to go with my MP3 player
The ear buds that come with the MP3 Player are not only too big, they are uncomfortable
These hit the nail on the head and you do have a choice of sizes
I like the EX10 pretty well
The housing is really small, so they're very comfortable and stay in-place well (for earbuds)
The only issue is with the paper separating the speaker from the "output point
"  Basically, there's a piece of super-thin paper to either equilize the tonality or to prevent earwax from getting into the housing
The problem is, earwax still gets in, and while you can remove wax from the tubular output chambers, you can't get it off the paper well enough to not compromise volume
So, I suggest removing that paper immediately
The best way to do earbud maintenance is with either an open staple or an unbent paperclip
It's a constant pain to do it, but you have to do it with any headphones
If you want an even more comfortable option than these, check out the EX55 - the housing is silicon instead of plastic so they're ridiculously comfortable - but they will also set you back $30 with no discernible increase in sound quality
For Listening music, this is too good but for attending calls, our voice is too low for the caller while we are in outdoor
I thought it would provide more bass
My headphones did not come with various ear bud sizes or options
But you can't complain for its price
I would much rather have and have had these headphones:Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone (B003EM8008Slightly cheaper and much better, and comes with various ear bud sizes or options
Like all good ear buds they eventuality break, but these last longer, are great quality and are the least expensive ones I have found
Buy them
Ignore bad Reviews and trust me
I have been using these for 5 years
If you aren't looking for expensive ones but great quality than go with theses Sony MDREX10LP
I guarantee you won't be Sorry
:)
Wonderful item
Works great with computer, mp3 player and tablet
love it
Would highly recommend this product to my friends
Awesome headphones
I used to have skullcandy but they got to expensive for me
These are a nice alternative for a great price
I liked these headphones, and they were cheaper than buying them in the store
It's always nice when you can purchase something on line
Ok, I know these aren't the most expensive headphones, but for $8 I got a pair for my office at work and they are great
Bought a second pair of these for the same price and keep them in my travel stuff for when I go out of town
I did have a pair of these about 2 years ago, and although they only lasted for a year before one of the buds stopped working, it was well worth the $8 they cost me at the time~
Inexpensive but not cheap
I don't care that they wear-out due to nighttime/sleeping use
Sound great
Pretty good at noise canceling
love it ,but not very durable on the end tip
yes will again just a different end tip thank you
While I can't personally rate this since it was a gift, I can say that the price was good, it was packaged well and arrived on time
And the recipient was quite excited
For these little headphones they provide some awesome sound and great bass
For paying under $10 for them, I definitely would recommend them
Good earphones and cheap
They worked exactly like I hoped that they would
They are great for the money and worth it
Great sound for the price
Love them
Fast shipping and quality product
Nice bass and high end response
Recommend for the low price and great sound
I foolishly bought another pair of these after experiencing a defect from a previous pair I owned
The right ear bud doesn't emit any sound
Aside from that the sound quality is not very good
I am very disappointed with Sony putting out such a poor quality product
Either there is a problem in the connection or where the wire goes into the connection--in any event, it's fine if there is no movement, but if you are walking or move the cord in any way, there is static
I go through/break a lot of earbuds, so I'm glad that these were pretty cheap
The earbud sound was pretty good, not quite as good as my Panasonic RPHJE120K but much better than the tinny sounds from my Skullcandy earbuds
I would've given 4 or more stars, but my earbuds are slightly defective
The right earbud volume was slightly lower, and if I turn the cable a certain way when I'm listening to music, I get a lot of crackle
Its really good and great value for money
Good Sound but the wires are thin
But worth for how much we pay
I had these for a long time now great sound and they feel great, better then those cheep head phones at Walmart
Dr
Dre Beats headphones vs
these: one has a fancy logo, the other doesn't
These come with 3-4 (can't remember) different sizes of rubber to fit any ear, they stay in even when you're running/jumping/careening around on a hard workout, and the cord is nice and long, easy to keep out of the way under a shirt or jacket
I love sony and its products
these earphones I use all the time
the bass sound quality is great
outside noise is completely blocked
I use them all the time
they will last a lifetime
The earbuds came a lot earlier than expected :)
I love the Sony products
The earbuds stuck in my ears and came with 2 other sets of buds
It was a great price and very nice in quality
I would recommend this to anyone
Ordered the buds for my dad and so far no complaints
These will help when he watches tv at the clinic for privacy
I bought these as a second pair after being so impressed with my first Sony Earbuds of the same design
I find them very comfortable and due to the angled design you don't need to look at them to tell left from right
However, I'm knocking off a star because the newer set no longer came with the volume slider or the little rubber piece for wrapping up excess cord length
I was pleased with these headphones
I ordered them for my 8 year old daughter
She waited anxiously to get them and was happy they came so quickly
She uses  them all the time and loves that they match all the other accessories she has for her Ipod
didn't work when it came and the package was open
This is the second time this happen
Im done with it
This was given as a gift to my child and she/he loved the sound that it produces
Also likes how they fit the ear
I really enjoy hearing my music with high quality earphones
I was traveling and forgot to pack my usual set
I stopped in at a store and bought these just to carry me thru the trip
I was VERY surprised at the sound quality of these buds
It's hard to find decent bass in the first place
so I was quite impressed
I've used these for several months now and they're pretty sturdy
I came on Amazon to pick up a spare pair and ended up getting 3 backup pairs when I saw the unbelievable price
LOVE these
They didnt even last a week
After 5 days one of the ear buds just stopped working
dont waste your money
These headphones are really boomy in the soprano register
At this frequency everything is much much louder than everything else
Also these are just poorly designed
The ends of the buds are too small, so you have to physically pull the wire to get them out of your ear, and they're harder to get in; the wire is thin and flimsy, and gets tangled much easier than Samsung earphones; and the 90 degree kink at the jack is really annoying on a lot of devices
They work just about as well as you'd think they would, for the price
Cheap, easy to use, and they work pretty well
They are nice, we can listing the son clearly
Sonny branch is good to use
I love it
Decent sound for the price, but their very irritating
They go inside your ear, and the form factor makes a point pushing at the back of your ear
Always slipping and falling out, doesn't help to the discomfort
One of the earpieces did not work
The seller gave me a very hard time when I asked about exchange or refund
They responded that the merchandise they sell is never defective and if I don't like Sony quality, then I should return it
Yet they ignored my request for return or exchange and did not provide me with the details on how to do so
I eventually threw them away and purchased a different brand from a different vendor
I would not recommend these headphones, nor the vendor that sold them to me
I had gotten a pair of these as a gift and after about 9 months one of the ear buds stopped working
They were comfortable with great sound quality so I ordered another pair--and after 4 months I have the same issue
They're inexpensive, but I'm sick of replacing them so frequently
Granted, I bring them to and from the office and the gym nearly every day so they do see a fair amount of wear and tear
I dont know, it just doesnt sound as right as the old sony earphones i have
Doesnt sound as rich
These earbuds have the same kind of weak sounding quality that i felt with the Apple earphones
After this im definately not going to buy earbuds again, so hard to put on and feels weird
Edit: Actually the way i was using it was probably wrong, you gotta make sure you push it up in your ear properly, and that was the reason my sound was sounding bad
I actually really like it once i know how to use it :D
Sony makes quality products
The sound us great and the fit in the ear is good
I would recommend this product
It works pretty well, but does'nt fits my ear (actually I think it's my ears' problem hahaha)The sound is fine, good material quality
no they aren't the best in the market but for the price they are hard to beat
I have 2 pairs
I leave one at work and the other travels with me in my car
they work perfect, and good quality and you will have no regrets about it
Sony is the best to have
You can not beat the quality of the headphones for the price
Do you lose a little on the highs and lows sure
Do you get powerful tub thumping base
No
What do you get is a decent pair of headphones for under 15 bucks
I have no complaints
An inexpensive set of earphones with decent sound
They work, they sound great and when I lose them, or run the wire over with my chair
I will not cry because I spent so much money
Fast shipping
good quality
What more could you expect
These are not worth the time or money
No bass and the right ear bud hardly worked
Don't waste your time with these
I've been buying Sony earbuds for years because they have always had the best sound and the best fit for the money and these don't disappoint
If you are looking for big sound this isn't for you, but if your want really good sound for a low price then buy these
a little different than others with the sound but I still like it, nice base and can handle loud sound
I bought each of my family members a pair of head phones for Christmas and they each loved them
I love the color of these, perfect for my Ipod
But did not get case with it like I had order did not get charged for this would not order again
Dam
I didn't expect these earphones to be so good in quality
The bass is really good and clear
I prefer music with heavy bass and these earphones are handling the bass output pretty well
These earphones are amazing and I think it is pretty good for the price that you get them with
I like the in ear type because it fits comfortably into your ear without feeling that something is stabbing the inside of your ear
It literally feels like you didn't stick anything in your ear and sometimes I even forget I have them on haha
The cord stretches long enough
I like the L-Shaped aux tip because it prevents the cord from breaking off or getting damaged if you are moving a lot
I guess it also helps with angle also
Very light and can fit anywhere as long as you curl it up the correct way
Comes with 3 soft gel cushion tips for small, medium, and large sized ears
Overall, this product surprised me and I have always liked buying Sony products
Great earbuds but they do not work with the Lifeproof case on the iPhone I purchased these for
Have to take case off anytime I want to use them
Great little headphones
Comfortable, dynamic sound, comes with a cable organizer and different ear tips
Buy these if you care about sound but not enough to spend much more than what these cost
Great pair of headphones for the price
Would purchase again
Sound is very clear and they fit perfectly
Ordered eight pair for my nieces and nephews
I have no problems with the headphones themselves
Yet, the plastic case they came in was blatantly torn open, and the pieces were scattered in the box
Kind of takes away from the product when its being presented as a gift
I've been using this headphone for 2 months and it's still good
However, don't expect too much about a headphone in this price, it works but it doesn't have a perfect sound effect
However, I still like it very much
Great product for a low price
Easy to change ear bud sizes that stay in when you exercise or run
Deliver sound from my devices that accomodate a headphone jack
Sounds great for cost 7 bucks
You wont be dissapointed but you wont be amazed
But you shouldn't be expecting to be amazed since they cost 7 dollars
But they work great, they last, so 5 stars
I'm giving this three stars simply because of the quality
This is a classic case of you get what you pay for
They are not the best sounding headphones on the market
If your goal is just to have something that carries sound from a device to your ears and your not real worried about sound quality than these are perfect
There great for talk radio, listening to sports and the like
If your looking for headphones that will enhance your music listening experience than these are not the headphones for you
There well worth the money (I paid just under 10 bucks), but honestly it all depends on what your looking for out of a set of headphones
Shipping was fast, however the product package was open and the ear buds were spread throughout the shipping package
I should of knocked off another star for the package, but I based my review on the quality of the product
When all is said and done that's what really matters
this thing broke on me after a couple month's use
however, when it was still alive i liked it very very much
Great headphones, lasted a solid 6 months getting thrown around in my book bag, etc
Would buy again
and again
third ordering these headphones, Pretty reasonable for what I got
Although I had to send one pair back for technical reasons overall I ordered them again
These sound pretty good
They could use a little more bass
Well worth the very small price even with shipping added,
I was looking for earbuds to replace my Maximo iMetal Headphones, which are no longer available and for which I paid $17
00
I thought they were amazing for the money, but these Sony headphones are every bit as good and even more comfortable
After experimenting, I've found that the "lounge" setting on an Ipod/Iphone brings out their best qualities: rich bass,clear treble, excellent channel separation
Best of all, they fit so comfortably in your ear that you can put your head on a pillow and not even feel them (important for long flights)
I really don't think you can do better for under $10
00
These headphones come with 3 different, easily changeable, earbuds
The standard size are too large for me, so having the option for a smaller bud was great
I was very happy
Sound quality is fine, but these don't stay in my ears and the left speaker broke after 4 days
Better than nothing, but that's it
In the technical information of the description it simply says; microphone
There is no microphone on this unit
They fit in the ear good but since I bought these for my ps4 I will be returning these because once again there's no microphone
I tried them right after getting them, they were FAULTY
Connection would get lost when the cable was moved, and they was staticky
Literally, minutes after opening the package
I'm soo dissapointed
This ear buds are wonderful to use and have great sound
I bought another pair at an electronics store and paid more for them
For the price you can t demand more
Good bass, nice isolation from exterior, several sizes for ear plugs
I recommend this if you look for nice low budget head phones
Hands down these are the best in-ear value for the price
I jam these LOUD during my workouts
Will buy again
This is the second item I buy because my previous one didn't function properly anymore
the left ear-bud started to produce poor sound level so I though it was something I did because of my recklessness and ordered another one because I liked how well they fitted my ears
But, again, the same problem occurred after the same time the problem occurred in the first one (expect it to poorly function after 1 month use)
I bought these to replace a pair of old ear buds, and only expected them to be okay, however, the sound is quite clear
I won't get into the mids, lows, and highs, as these are $10 and if you're expecting Hi-Fi go get some Noontech headphones
I listen to extreme metal music with at least 3 hours a day of listening, so it's not like I haven't put them to extended periods of use
They are comfortable, more-so than some so called "ergonomic' ear buds I've used, (such as Maxwell cool beans), and they come with extra tip sizes, which is a bonus
One thing about these, I ordered a white pair of these, and received a black pair
I don't much mind the color difference, and it's probably seller dependent, (I ordered from "Smashing Deals"), but it irked me a little bit
I already own dozens of black cables
Micro USB, USB extension cords, HDMI, DVI, VGA, and so forth, and I was looking forward to mix things up
I've used them for a couple days and I'll update in a few weeks
The short: 9/10 for price, but you may not get the same color as ordered
lasted six months in my sleep - tossing and turning on them
bought as gift for grandson
being able to pick out just what he wanted on line with him was fun also
he's happy, I'm happy
I am hard on headphones - mine never seem to last a few months due to rough treatment, so I always prefer buying inexpensive ones
These are very comfortable and have held up well so far
Sound quality is nowhere near Bose-level, but that's not what you buy these for
These headphones aren't waterproof and are very inexpensive
But they produce a very good quality sound and one was submerged in a glass of tea for a few minuets and after a few shakes and a good drying works like a charm
Good purchase
This headphones are high quality priced¡Good fidelity, nice shape and comes with 3 different ear pugs sizes¡¡will definitely buy another ones for my brother
I love these headphones, sound too good and isolate outside sound perfectly
I love, are comfortable and cheapthe shipping was fastI recommend for the price and quality
These are a bang for a buck no doubt
But each pair I have owned, the right ear bud has went out
Still would buy a pair if I am ever around a place selling them
Too much unwanted noise generated by headphone
Much worse than "JLab JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds"
Very surprised by this SONY product
For the price it's hard to beat these headphones
I use them with my iphone while cutting grass and it helps to reduce the noise from the tractor
They offer very good sound and don't bother my ears after wearing them for several hours
I bought two
1st pair came with a lower volume on one side
Had to process return right away
Replacement functioned well but only for a month or so before one side volume went out completely ( past 30 day warranty)My second pair ( white) went out as well - no sound on one side shortly after
Not happy at all
all was ok thanks, I was I requested, all was ok, thanks a lot for all, I will buying more
Honestly it seems like these are hit or miss
I've had 2 pair, and my first ones were amazing
So when I got a new pair after my first ones got washed in the washing machine, they seem way different
Like the right ear bud is way quieter than the left
the audio quality is good, but it does not have a mic
In the technical details, microphone is mentioned, but the earphone does not have a mic
It came in the mail and wasnt working when I tried to use it
waste of my money
not worth it at all
After finding my last pair of these sitting in a cup of water ruined (Kids or possibly the Old Lady) I decided than and there to come on Amazon and find another set
Luck would have it that they had them and I bought them as fast as I could move my mouse to the Buy option
These buds have a great sound for the price
They don't feel like Gumdrops in your ears either
Whether listening to Motorhead or Jim Croce the music always sounds great
They won't sound like the expensive ones but they will sound good without spending a lot of hard earned cash
Pretty decent sound quality for the economical price
Plus, they're very comfortable to wear
Would recommend people to buy them
Excellent sound, very good ear fitting accessories, light weight, good quality material
Great value for money
I really recommend it
Good bass, but not very noise cancelling
I work around heavy equipment and could barely hear my music not satisfied
These are definitely the best value quality headphones I've owned, I've bought 3 pairs (I lose headphones A LOT) and I've gotten these ones every time because they're cheap, and they work really well
Worked well with good sound quality while still intact
After about two months they started to fall apart and I had to replace them
These headphones have really good bass and decent treble
For 9 dollars, great value
Doesn't seem to be the most durable but I wouldn't mind replacing them a couple times a year
it broke in a month of use
first one ear stopped working then the other broke by the next week
I like these headphones
They work well and have good sound
I have bought some other brands in the past that when I put them in my pocket will get a loose wire over time and the sound will go in and out
But not these
They are sturdy and last
Recommended
The seller got these to me within 3 days
and the headphones are amazing
The quality is something I'd expect from a pair of 80-100 dollar ear-buds, I have no complaints
The seller also included paperwork with all of his info for any questions or complaints, very professional all around
sounds great, love sony earbuds
crystal clear sound, nice bass, lovely highs can't put them down
love it love it
When I used one set of the earbuds for the first time only one channel worked
This was my backup pair for the gym and the vendor tells me they will not replace it
Good Bass good Sound quality with extra 2 buds
Long wire
product is overall nice
I would definitely recommend it
I was excited to get some earbuds by Sony
I have always liked the Sony sound but these headphones are not what I was expecting
Sony needs to get back to the drawing board and make quality stuff, even if you have to pay a little more for it
Its pretty bad when my sons Ipod headphones are better than Sony
Well, they were cheap and worked fine for a while, but today the right earpiece finally gave out
I checked the date, and it was four months ago, to the day, that I placed the order
In the past couple of weeks both ears started fritzing a little, but if I wiggled the wires a little it would come back
My guess is that the wire on the right ear came unsoldered, but fixing that is more effort than I want to put into a pair of $10 headphones
Skip apple EarPods which are worth like 30$ and get these
You can't compare these to the skullcandies in this price range
I got mine for 15$ at best buy
They are well worth it
I haven't tried earbuds at that price that provide the clarity and bass that these provide
They are very simple and light weight, easy to store
Feel a bit flimsy but I've been using mine for months and I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat if these died
I trust the sony brand for everythingIncluding personal audio
I own 4 pairs of sony headphones including some higher end stuff, I chose their brand for mostly everything including cameras, tvs, etc
Sony for the win
I purchased these ear buds to use with the "Sleep Pillow" app for my iPod Touch to provide white noise while sleeping
I wanted ear buds that wouldn't fall out of my ears for 8 hours
The ear buds that came with the iPod Touch and a pair of JVC ear buds that I purchased did not stay in my ears--they don't fit inside the ear canals
The Sony ear buds did the trick
They come with 3 sizes of polymeric baffles one of which fit my ear canals perfectly
So now I can sleep like a baby connected to my iPod Touch--no external white noisemaker necessary
The sound quality is not as good as that exhibited by the iPod Touch or the JVC ear buds
For listening to music or watching movies these have better bass response and brighter treble than the Sony ear buds
I bought this as a simple no frills set for running and exercise and I am very happy
In ear headphones are what I prefer but I think my one ear is a different shape than most and they tend to hurt my ears but these are fine
The in part that goes in your ear is a very soft rubber/silicone which makes them easy to wear and clean
These headphones are really quiet, there isn't any bass at all
Even if I turn on the bass booster on my phone
I had some xx headphones prior to these but I gave them away, I got these as a cheap alternative and I highly regret it
I don't hate them, but for under $20 you can't beat the xx headphones because all music sounds good on those
Plus these don't cancel out any outside noise
These earbuds have a few sizes for the in ear part so you can get a comfortable fit and don't end up with earbuds that are constantly falling out of your ears
This earbuds work very well
I can't believe how inexpensive they are and will continue to buy Sony brand anything since I never seem to have bad luck with these or any Sony product- seriously
g-
Very poor sound quality
No bass and damping total volume
Very disappointed
I have owned and enjoyed 3 pairs of SONY MDR-E10LP Lightweight Earbuds, which have great sound and fit
They don't seem to be available anymore
Good headphones, had them for three weeks now and still going strong (rough with headphones so most dont last long with me) packaging came opened though =[
Sound was great, but fragile
The right side stopped working after 2 months, as it is outside of the return period, I'm out of luck
sound great, awesome price
what can you expect for less than $10
decent bass, long enough cord, decent sound, nice
These are terrific
I use them with my music on my iPhone
Metal sounds soooooo good
Deep bass and clear high's
$9 is an absolute steal for these
I was looking for some earbuds that had a good bass and found these I decided to get them because the reviews it had were pretty good when I got them I was very disappointed because there was no bass and by the end of the week the right side was not working
I do not recommend these if you want earphones with a good bass
Sony is always my best bet for durability and sound quality
Take these with me to the gym almost everyday
I lost the rubber earplug part and simply replaced with ones I have from another set (not sony) that are so quiet I can't hear my music over the noise of the treadmill
Bought these in need for temporary earphones and ended up sticking with them
The sound is great
Comes with small, medium, and large size buds to apply the ones that fit to your liking
Not bad for the price,  not bad at all
I love my new Sony In-Ear Headphones
I have several pairs of standard type headphones, with the little foam covers
My ears would get sore after a time; not a good fit and I had to periodically force them back in place, etc
However, with my Sony In-Ear Headphones, several sizes of earbuds were provided and I found just the right fit for me -- and now I'm happy
There are more expensive models out there, but the sound quality of this brand is excellent and the price was certainly affordable
I would recommend
An easy way to satisfy gift requests
My grand-son is a runner and this seems to be a get set of earphones that stays in place
I had a different kind of headphone before, that didn't fit tightly in the ear like these do
Listening is so much more pleasurable when you don't have to worry about your headphones falling out if you move
These are great and the listening quality is great
Pros:Amazing Sound quality,Crisp sounds,Crisp Bass,Deep low bass (can go down to 8 hz
)
Cons:One of my sisters earbuds stopped working (i have had mine longer [over a year] and still don't have a problem),The chord is very thin and flimsy, so just don't be rough with it and you will be fine
Overall:Great earbuds for the price
I bought these as a gift for a friend and she seems to like them
Sony is generally an ok brand
best value with a brand name out there
period
light weight, crisp sound, doesn't get too loud but all in all fantastic for the price
I rec
Great Value
Sony in-ear headphones have always been good but Sony has managed to move excellent quality into low-end, low cost ear-buds
The headphones were priced at $10, slightly more than the best selling Panasonic's but they have a  broader sound range and more precise, even purer sounding sound that facilitates listening to individual musical instrument should you want
These are my everyday headphones and are very durable; just make sure you properly size  the ear cushions as it makes a big difference in sound quality
Just ok nothing special don't sound that good with iPod turned all the way up during working out
May have to look for some other ones
I've been using these headphones for about 1 month, and I'm totally convinced
I mostly use them outside to listen audio podcasts, and the sound is great, balanced, clear, and the isolation from external noise is efficient
I had sennheiser headphones before, and for twice the price, it was not that good
I was expecting better sound quality from these
I am little disappointed with these Sony headphones
Value for what you pay, good alternative for travelers who keep loosing headphones
love them
was just looking for cheap headphones to buy well these are great quality and i plan on buying more in a different color
:)
These headphones are ok
Not the best
I didn't expect much for ten dollars but overall im fairly satisfied
There was one problem I had
If you move the cable where it attaches to the headphone jack, the right ear will briefly cut out
If you are looking for a cheep pair that probably won't last more that two weeks, these headphones are a good choice
Product was comfortable and worked great for 3 months then stopped working
Obviously not constructed well and a blot on the Sony brand
The ear plugs work well, and are relatively cheap
I have some at work, in my home office, in my bed room (they work on my phone, computer, tablet, etc
)
They do a decent job blocking out the noise on planes
not noise cancelling but way, way better than what the airlines supply
They are comfortable
The only reason I don't give them a five is that the wires pull out
On the later ones I have bought I've put a bit of glue where the wires go into the ear buds (strain relief) to keep the wires from pulling out
The jack end still wears out, but much more slowly
They'd get a five if the wire connections didn't 'wear out'
Excellent Buds
I had another pair and lost them
I switched to regular earphones, and they were never the same
I finally purchased this and have been using them a couple of months
No regrets
The quality of the product, and the sound they produce, there's no comparison
WOW
Exactly what I've been looking for
It is an exact fit for my ears
I'm no sound expert, but the music is perfect
I use this at the gym and they haven't fallen out once during hard cardio sessions
Whenever my daughter massacre's my headphones or my wife supposedly steps on them by accident
I always buy these pair to replace the old one of the same make and model
They fit well in my ears without a lot of adjustments and it so happens that this one was sent on time like a boss (very timely)
The sound quality is good as well for a cheap pair of headphones
I recommend all the way
I only used these sitting at my desk at work
One ear stopped working after a week
After the second week they didn't work at all
Buy anything else
I wish I could say how much of an awesome value these are when you compare quality and price
The sad fact is the moment I received them, the right ear bud is near dead (sound can barely be heard)
Doing a quick scan of reviews on Amazon I see this has happened to others
Not good
Going for my refund
Sound quality is amazing for the price, but the right earbud is dead not four weeks after purchase
I wonder how much I have to pay to get my headphones to last, oh I don't know, a whole year
I always come back to amazon for these same headphones
any color
They have great bass, fit well and last a long time
I probably would have given these 5 stars (considering performance for price) except for the fact that I keep pulling the wire out of the 90 degree plug at the molded strain relief - a weak point in the design / construction
After pulling the cord out of the fitting on my second pair, I managed to work the cord (partially
) back into the strain relief fitting, then took a lighter and slightly melted the strain relief fitting onto the cord
Gave it a bit of a tug, and the cord now seems firmly connected
When it arrived, the left side was louder right side
The day after all of the sudden it stopped working
So i didn't bother and threw them out
For the price you can hardly best them
If you are looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones, I would definitely recommend these
I work in an office and will not bring my $300 set in because for one, my iphone can't make good use of them anyways but two, I don't want them stolen
These sonys are a fantastic option for about $10 that sound great, give nice bass and won't hurt if they break or get stolen
I will say they feel fairly flimsy, not that bad but I would say for office use they are great
For outside use or workout they may last for a little while but if you tug them hard enough times I can see them breaking without a lot of effort
good quality earphones, it also comes with the different ear hole sizes small, med , largepros: cheaper than the store price, good quality sound (my money was well spent)cons: i don't have any
Subject line sums it up
It's cheap, but apparently you take your chances
My other headphones work fine with my phone
I have gone through around thirty ear buds in the last ten years
None of them had the ear comfort of these speaker pillows
The sound quality seems like full room speakers
These sound better than Bose sound systems
I really recommend these headphones
great sound for the price
awesome quality
loved it
thumbs up
great product
I have tried several ear headphones (most of which came with the personal amplifiers I bought) with very poor results so I figured that Sony would make acceptable quality ones even though the price was low and, at last, these work fine with all the amplifiers I had purchased from other manufacturers
So don't give up if the ear headphones supplied with a personal amplifier give you terrible performance try these to test your amplifiers
I had another pair of sony's that shorted out on one side,  I  paid like 3o bucks or so and got a fair amount of use out of them
They sounded good and isolated the noise so much better than stock iPhone buds
Great for riding my bike without wind noise
These are very similar but cost half the price
Inexpensive enough and good sound
I'm still thinking about splurging on  higher end pair of those "balanced armature" models and they probably will sound better but these are great especially for workouts and bike riding because they will get abused and the heartbreak will be ok compared to the price of the balanced models
I purchased the white color
The look was kinda cheap, but ok
the sound quality was fine
But unfortunately,  one earbud stopped working after one day
Inexpensive with great sound quality and comes with three different sizes of ear buds
Just be careful when you stow them
The cord can become frayed easily after some time (my second pair)
Otherwise if you are looking for a cheap pair of headphones with great sound quality and comfort, I highly recommend these
Once again, Sony didn't disappoint me
Sturdy earbuds with great sound
They do drwon out outside noises, so if your expecting a call or someone sneaks up on you, beware
:-)
Honestly
These earbuds are amazing
Pros: They Feel Really Comfortable  They're Dirt Cheap  Sound Quality Is Great for the price  Good Length(If you care to know)  If they go through the wash, They still sound awesome  EQ is pretty good
Treble is Clear and Mids are Mids not too high or low and The Lows Are  nice and Deep enough
its not overkill like some headphonesCons: Shouldve included an extra pair of earbuds tips of the same size
(all earbuds tips come off  Pretty easily)This is a Short Review but there is not much to say
If your looking for great earbuds for the price this is the one
you get what you pay for
very cheap price and quality
so beware of these headphones not working for very long
This headphones have a great perfomance, I really like it
I would like buy another in a different color as soon as I can
The sound is so clear and they fit really well in your ears
Great price
The only downside is that they do irritate your ears after a while like all headphones do
I give it 5 stars because I mistakenly ordered it for Android and it is for the IPhone
I returned it for a full refund
I've been buying cheep headphones from the corner store for a while now, and after a few weeks they always, ALWAYS stop working
Finally I decided to search for affordable quality earbuds online
These earbuds have surpassed the life of all my pervious corner store earbuds, and produces a better, crisper sound
They even take a beating and still work perfect
The cushions come off a little too easy for me, but not so easy that I wouldn't recomend thses earbuds anyone
I have a pair of more expensive Sony headphones/earbuds, and recently one side stopped working
I bought these to save some money with the hopes that this lesser expensive product (yet being Sony), would meet my expectations
They do
I enjoy a lot of bass in my music, and these deliver
These are the only In-Ear headphones that seem to last
I've used some other brands before but they'd always start having problems after about four or five months
These have lasted for about a year with heavy usage
Also, They are also quite comfortable with the 3 different bud sizes that you can swap with
Definitely worth the price
I have been through so many of these Sony headphones in the past few years that I cannot even count anymore
For the price they offer loud Sony trademark sound, with good base
The cord is more than enough for a grown man
I prefer these earbuds to the typical Apple headphones
My only gripe is these are not durable nor sweat resistance which is my fault for not looking
I workout pretty hard including circuits, crossfit, weights ect
I can't fault the product for something I failed to realize, but buyer beware these are NOT for intense exercise or sweat resistance
This latest pair barely last two months before the sound was effected
Great sounding heaphones, really good buy for the price, i have not had any problems
love them
highly recommended if you travel
I bought these to replace a pair a bought at a local store years ago for only a couple bucks more
I was hoping they were the same that I bought at the retail store but sadly they are not
The bass is not as clear, these rattle almost when played loud
I cannot max them out on my Droid Razr Maxx or it will sound horrible
My three year old Sony's didn't have that issue
Update: I bought these in the beginning of August
They stay at my desk at work and are used 40 hours a week
The right ear bud has now stopped working
The same problem it seems a lot of recent buyers are experiencing
I guess they don't make them like they used to
Old pair lasted 3 years before this problem showed up but it was from putting my phone in my pocket and bending the wires constantly
This pair I did not use it that way and left them plugged into my laptop all the time to hopefully prevent this issue
Wiggling the wires doesn't bring the right side back to life either (like it did with my old pair) so I'm not sure this is a loose wire issue either
Down to a 1 star rating since they lasted less than 4 months
Sound quality is ok, but it has a low reliability
Unfortunately :(It says you have 1 year warranty, don't forget to keep receipt and warranty
For $10 earbuds, these are amazing
Make sure you use the earbuds that fit snug in your ear for deep bass and rich sounds
I like how inexpensive these are for the sound quality you get
There is nothing I dislike about it
I use this when riding my motorcycle so I can listen to music or get direction from my smartphone
This is a Sony product so you know it's quality made
dont like the sound
too muffled and distorted
didnt pay alot for it so im not complaining
but if you want good bass dont get this
You know, one of the really frustrating things about earbuds is there is no way to preview them
not that I necessarily want to- ew
But this means you really have to rely on the reports of others before you take the plunge
I've read a lot of positive reviews of these buds and my expectations were high
I must say, I have no idea why anyone would rate these positively
They have the same problem that an unfortunately high number of earbud models share: unacceptably harsh and grainy treble
This interferes with my enjoyment of music constantly, to the point that on some tracks it actually hurts my ears to listen
I'm not being hyperbolic
I mean real, tangible pain
They are also heavily veiled, and by that I mean all the details are lost in the muddy harshness that predominates the sound
Also, for the love of God, earbud manufacturers, stop producing buds with cord sleeves along the barrel somewhere instead of at the end, where it belongs
This limits how easily people with large canals can get good isolation, which is key to sound quality with buds
I could only get it by swapping in quite large pads that were provided with another set of buds that just happened to fit these
I managed to finally get a passable fit, though the cord still makes it uncomfortable
Even when isolation is at its best, the high frequencies are tinny and harsh, so the fit is not the problem
I would pass on these
I certainly wouldn't buy them again
They've been relegated to my work computer where they will largely sit unused except to stick one in my ear occasionally to make sure an audio feature on a website I am designing works
There's no way I could stand to use these for the extended time
I wanted some earphones I could use when I'm in bed or walking to class instead of using my nicer headphones everywhere
This does the job
Don't expect much bass or high notes, but it isn't horrible either
So far these seem durable, then again I take good care of my belongings
Just be a little careful with them and they should last you a while
8/10 would buy again
I find this to be a great option for good cheap earbuds
They are around $10 and if you break or loose you just replace by new ones
The sound is good and they are comfortable to use
the quality is good, and the line is very long, it is convenience
I like it very much
Well those were a waste of money
They lasted on ride
A slight tangle with a helmet strap and the wire pulled straight out of the earbud
Hi guys, I just bought a pair of these and if you want nothing but treble then fine
These sound exactly like the free ones I get in the Marriott fitness room
There is no bass whatsoever and very little mid-range - so their claims are not valid
I am an ex rock musician so I know how the music should sound
Save your money as there are some other Sony earbud based headphones that have a WAY BETTER quality of sound
Buy these instead and you'll be much happier  Sony MDRE828LP/SLV Lightweight Earbuds (Silver)
Just about the same price
If you don't believe me - buy one set of each and see for yourself the HUGE DIFFERENCE in audio quality
I honestly cannot believe so many people say these sound good
It shows me why marketing and appearance has more to do with what people buy in audio gear than the quality
Good headphones but they don't always stay in my ears, especially when I'm jogging
Solid sound quality for the price
The left side of these headphones were quieter when I received it
Otherwise it doesn't sound too bad, and stays on my ear when I'm running
i've had these for a couple months and (properly cared for) they haven't fallen apart
I wish I could say the same about all the Skullcandy crap I've had to replace lately
for the money you will not find a better earbud
i listen to mine all day every day and usually get about 6 month out of these lil guys
skullcandies or others like them i might get 2 or 3 months tops
these guys sound great and last a while
garbage item
it's broken for less than a month and a half
The return period just expired and I was no longer able to return it
If u have apple or plastic earbuds, then u are going to THIS
The earbuds fit nice into the ears, creating a very comfortable experience
Quality wise, they are great
Not as good as beats though
I have tried several different ear plugs and ear phones and this is the most comfortable brand out if 20 I tried
I have had these ear buds for nearly three years now and they still work great
The sound is very good, and for $10 I don't think you could find a better value deal
I would highly recommend them to anyone
I ordered these because I needed earbuds that wouldn't come out when I was jogging
These earbuds accomplish that aim but suffer from poor sound quality and noise associated with movement
So now my choice comes down to using earbuds that stay in place and put out weak sound, or those that sound great but always require me to adjust them
these headphones are ok
the highs are good the mids are ok and the bass is ok not to overpowering
overall great sound quality
i would recommend these for an average consumer
I have owned them before and damaged my last set, so I had to replace them with the same thing
These are amazing
I have 5 pair and keep them wherever I go
Cancel noise for studying
They also last a while
I love these headphones, and I have been buying them for years
I bought my first set in 2007 when I bought my first i-Pod
My first set lasted three years before one of the earbuds started to crackle when I moved
I heavily abused them (shoved into my tennis bag every day before matches, shoved into my book bag after walking across campus)
They block out sound and have a great quality without being ridiculously expensive like other earbuds out there
The left earbud started crackling and not working after about a month of semi-regular use
Be aware that although these earbuds are cheap, they are certainly not durable
I bought two, and as i suspected one ear bud malfunctioned in a week and theother still standing
I've had them for a month
For the price you can't beat the return on the price paid
Hopefully the wire doesn't crack and I lose one of sides to soon
I didn't like these at all
I take perfect care of my headphones and these just broke within a month or two of use
The sound quality was pretty good but they didn't last like i wouldve liked them to
Was looking for some low cost headphones to replace some beats that stopped working and these are very good so far
Great headphones, don't tangle too often sound great
Use them everyday, best used with GZA's Liquid Swords album
Ten out of ten
I just purchased this set of SONY MDREX10LP earbuds ($14
99) and for comparison, the cheaper COLBY CVEM79 earbuds ($11
50); both from a local drug store
The SONY's surprised me by yielding a duller sound, missing any highs and pumping low bass
Also there was a severe volume difference leading me to think that maybe there was an impedance mis-match with my iPhone 5
I also tried both pairs in my MacBook Pro and had exactly the same experience
Muddy base with no distinction of the instruments in music I had recorded myself and when listening to the same professionally mastered top 10 song
Don't buy this headset
The funny thing is I had done a similar comparison test several years before and the SONYS for $11 (same model) won out over Maxell earbuds and Skull Candy (the worse of all tried)
Colby is usually associated with "Cheap" but in this case, the opposite is true
The Colby's had rich booming bass, overall clarity and distinction, plenty of volume and great high end that didn't distort even when I turned the volume up all the way (which made the SONY's distort)
Bottom Line
FIND THE COLBY'S AND GET THOSE cause the SONY'S JUST DON'T CUT THE MUSTARD (MAYBE because that's what a knife is for), likewise, don't get them for listening to music either
That said, they might work better for Sony products or Windows products
Buy a few different brands and compare for yourself; if you value your listening experience
I usually get earbuds that are shaped to sit in your ear with a hard piece of the end, but I decided to try a style with flexible tips for a change
I was disappointed with both the sound and the fit
The sound is awfully tinny and practically bass-less
Also, regardless of which tips I tried, they did not fit well in my ears and if I so much as brushed the cord a little, they would fall out
This made them frustrating to use and even when I did get them to stay in, they didn't sound good at all
So I bought a pair of these about 15 months ago
I use them daily on my bike ride to campus, while studying, and in lab with my phone
I have not experienced the cord problems some here have, and I'm not extremely gentle with them given their price point (they spend a lot of time in my pant and backpack pockets)
I have had a pair of JVC and panasonic headphones around the same price point, and they both lasted 4-5 months before the dreaded cord cut-out began to occur
As for their sound, I listen to pretty diverse music, from The Andrew Bird to Bassnectar to Brian Eno's ambient works
In all cases, these have pretty great bass response and differentiation between bass, mids, and his
I have never purposely exposed them to a 'burn-in' process, but I will say that their sound definitely gets richer with playtime
I'm so impressed that I have already purchased two other pairs from BB (on sale) for the day that the first pair dies
If you're in the market for $10 headphones, these would absolutely have my vote
I use these for my Samsung S3 and while they are good sounding they cut out if the angled connecter piece that plugs into the headphone jack on my phone is facing a certain way, why wouldnt they just make a straight plug in connecter
Overall you get what you paid for which is a cheap pair of earbuds
Shipping was quicker than I thought, came in one day earlier
Earbuds are really soft, but the wire feels a bit cheap
Sounds good, but there's no mic
I get scared i will break it cause the wire is so thin
Love the fact that they are pretty long
Other than that, they are good headphones for that price
There okay but if u turn them u 2 much ppl can hear the way they feel in ur ear is great :b
These are pretty good
The one issue I have is that the rubber "earplugs" will pop off if you're not careful (i
e
, pulling them out of your pocket)
I've lost a couple that way
As the title says, they are dull with the IPod, and painful on the ears
I purchased these at Best-Buy, as I like to physically see the product before I purchase something
Perhaps it was just me, but they didn't produce the best sound on my IPod classic (160 GB, 7th gen
, for those that are curious)
Not bad, not great, but useful as a back-up pair
They did, however, produce an EXCELLENT sound quality on my mom's Motorola Electrify
They were crystal clear, and utterly beautiful, with the phone, but not so with my IPod
I did have issues with the actual rubber earbuds, as no matter what size I chose, they were either too small, or too big, and with all sizes, I couldn't leave them in for 15 min
as my ears began to hurt from them
I plan on returning them, and will be looking to purchase the Panasonic RPHJE120K In-Ear Headphone, Black as an actual set
Hopefully, they will be as great as the reviews say
Bought these before from a local Target
Great sound quality at a fair price
the white ones are very nice
sound reproduction is no better than a much less expensive model, but ear lobe insert is better than others to date
It took me sometime to write the review (3 more head phones)
I got best of it and love it
I love the sound and the way that they cancel surrounding sounds
they fit perfectly in my ear and are quite comfortable
they are just amazing
Cons:Cord almost feels a little cheap and flimsyPros:Has been put to the test for several months now in the gym and no problemsStill great audio coming throughComfortable ear budsLight enough to rarely notice the cord under my shirtStay in my ears fairly well even when I'm runningOverall, I'd recommend these for anyone looking for a reasonable pair of earphones that have proven to last several months with no issues
Look like Apple but they didn't hold up as well as Apple ear buds
Broke the second time I used them
The quality is better than the skull candy earphones that i have of the same price segment
The base is good and I am satisfied
The only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because I think there are always products which can be better that I havent tried yet
However I would absolutely recommend this earphones for listening to music on your phone
However loud you play the quality is awesome
I'm a ear bud novice and needed something that would allow for fitting for the first time and these fit the bill
Can't really compare sound and I needed for talk radio which these seem to handle
Left ear stopped working after about a month
Too bad, they fit and sounded really good
Oh, also does not have a mic which was one of my search criteria, must be miscategorized too
Purchased as a backup pair/ were quickly turning into my favorite
Sony=High quality sound
Get a pair and see what I am talking about
I purchased these headphones from a brick and mortar retailer at list price, so I had to pay a little more than the Amazon price
It's a good thing too, because the first time I bought them, I had to return them
The left headphone didn't work at all
I took them back and exchanged them for the same product
Although these work, they sound weird, it's hard to describe
The mid-range seems off and they have no bass whatsoever
I've had to adjust the equalizer in my preferred music player, which I've never had to do with any other headphones I've purchased
Before I was going to buy the earphones I read the comments to see if there was any bad reviews but I couldn't find any, so I was surrten that they were good but honestly I didn't like them
The sound was low, you could hardly hear anything and in just a few days it seed to get worse
I wasn't sure if they got damaged through the shipping, were defected or they were just crappy headphones
great value
I would recommend to anyone who wants to hear there music and there music only
clear highs and lows
I used to use SkullCandy ear phones
I probably bought 8 in a year because of how often they would stop working
I bought these and they lasted at least a year with lots of heavy abuse
They've been dropped in water while washing dishes multiple times, caught in a heated crockpot between the stoneware and the cooker, dropped and walked over and who knows what else
By the end, I had broken the the little head apart so there were wires showing and it was STILL working perfectly
I bought new ones after my dog chewed them up and finally killed them
The music sounds good
Nice high's and lows, but the vocals are terrible
Everything sounds like it is said through a tube
I cannot say I've experienced that with any other earbuds
I highly recommend looking elsewhere
I've had about 3 sets of these, I will never stray
they fit perfectly and have great sound quality for such a tiny ear piece
I needed a cheaper pair of earbuds, but I don't like sacrificing the quality
I've been wearing them for an hour or so now and they are fantastic
They fit well and look nice
The only thing I'm concerned about is the thinner cord
I'm afraid they may not hold up in a few months
I have found that I get much better sleep with ear bud type headphones on
I have several different brands that work great if you are vertical, but if you lay your head on the pillow they bite painfully into your ears
These don't
I've used them for over a month and they're very comfortable
I can roll my head anyway I need to
I wish of course I could do without wires, but well
there you go, right
I have a rather elaborate procedure of putting on my CPAP mask, then routing my earbuds through the tops straps and into my ears
Then turning on my android cell phones player
Even after the music/talk/hypnosis program is over, they are comfortable and noise reducing
I am getting addicted to not having all the noise going on
Yet my alarm clock app wakes me up in the morning if needed
(rarely used anymore
)
I'm generally happy with products made by Sony
However, these were already dead in the as-received state
Hopefully this was an exception
I really like these
The sound quality is good and the connector is "L" shaped so I don't wind up shorting them out after a week like I do with straight connectors
They come with three sizes of cushion, which makes them easy to customize
I wound up just making a pair specific to my ears with Sugru so I could jog with them in
One side stopped working after about 5 months
I expected it to be longer-lasting as a Sony product, so I was pretty disappointed
You should know, though, that I used it on my bike rides to school, stuffed it into my bag pretty aggressively, etc
So maybe if you don't use it like I did, it'll last longer
;) When it WAS working, it was amazing
SO much better sound quality than cheaper ones I've bought
I replaced my old iPhone 5 headphones for these and the sound is much better
Great product at a great price
Just as described
Very fast shipment
Would def
recommend for the low price
Def
worth purchasing if you love the sony brand like myself
Really nice headphones
Good price
Item arrived on time
Fits really well into the ear and doesnt fall out
Use it in the gym and the sound quality is good
Bought these to replace a pair that conked out
For the price, couldn't be happier as I use them daily for my 1 hour public transit commute
Highly recommend
I have had these earbuds for over five years with no issues
I use them working out, running and gardening with my iPod shuffle
The sound is clear and distinctive
I also have really small ear openings and have trouble finding comfortable earbuds that don't make my ears ache after a few mins or fall out while chewing gum
These were exactly what I needed
The smallest bud works and they stay in while running with no issues
I wanted to get another pair bc mine are looking a little gross after so many years of sweaty use and it would be nice to have a pair of really white buds and cord
I think the quality of the sound on all of the Sony earbuds I've had is fantastic
The fit in the ear isn't as comfortable as previous pairs but, for the price, you can't beat these
I highly recommend them
They are good for that prize, nice material and they fit nicely in your ear
They don't hurt and they don't come out
Only had these headphones for 2 months
At about 1
5 months, I started to notice the sound on the right ear bud to be  faint compared to the left one
Now the sound on the right ear bud is barely audible
Either I got a defective product or they are flimsy headphones
These earbuds sit nicely in the ear, are comfortable, and are lightweight
However, the sound quality in the left ear was beyond bad
The volume was much higher and the sound was muffled
Not only that, but the sound levels are different for each ear making for a lopsided sound
These earbuds make for an unbearable listening experience
I bought it to my father and he's not a pro user but he liked it very much
It's comfotable enough and the sound's not bad
They sound awesome, good bass response, confortable
Works great with my laptop, cellphone, Tablet and others
Very confortable for my ears
These worked great
bundled with gloves for free shipping
Plan on using heat shrink to make them last longer this time
Buy them
Right now
These are my favorite headphones the quality is great, and the price was unbeatable, they have also taken a beating through a few of my runs etc, and they are hanging in there
Great product
I recomend this phone because is not so expensive and the sound is perfect and fits good in my ear
Love it
This is my 4th or 5th pair of this brand, and compared to anything else I've bought on the market it's just so much better
The sound quality is amazingly high for such cheap earbuds
I used to go through headphones every 2 months or so just because of how much wear and tear I got on them, but this brand lasts twice as long and with much better quality than skullcandy or apple
I don't have too many brand loyalties to anything in particular, but this one stands out as the best on the market to me
These headphones are great and have great bass, wonderful product by Sony, quality product indeed
I decided to purchase these headphones because I listen to music everyday just about all day so I need durable headphones that will not blow out, these headphones have been perfect and have great bass to them
These ear buds give a good sound for such a cheap price
Adjustable buds for a good fit
Buy and enjoy
It has great sound but it is uncomfortable to wear, it hurts my ears while wearing them so I bought the Sony MDREX58V/BLK EX which I lost 2 days ago since it is comfortable to wear and does not hurt my ears
The sound quality on these is beautiful, but one issue I have is that the volume seems to be lower than that of my other headphones
Since I don't listen to music very loudly, it's not a big issue for me, but I've noticed that while most songs I can keep my volume at 2/10, on this one I occasionally have to increase to 3- or 4/10
Not a dealbreaker for me, since I'm for quality over quantity, but to some others this might be an issue
The sound is really good, but they fall out of my ears just walking around the house
There's no way I could even do low impact exercising wearing these, much less running, which is the whole reason I bought these
Waste of money
There's two camps: Cheapie-Deepie's and High End Aficionados
Shortly after realizing truly how bad white earbuds really are, I quickly became associated with the latter camp
I splurged on a pair of Bose IE2 and can honestly say they're among the best products I've ever owned, solidifying the Bose brand as a company I trust and purchase from whenever I'm in the market
However, entropy once told me that everything eventually wears, and I can't keep dropping $100 on headphones that can't hold up to the aggressive wear-and-tear that my lifestyle induces
These are the cheapie-deepie's, but they have enough kickin' bass to keep a meager audiophile content
I've had to replace them a few times, but that's precisely why I went to the other end of the market
I'm always replacing headphones, so why pay more
However if you're a nice guy and take care of your s***-- consider the Bose IE2, I won't even go into how sick the warranty on those things are
simply put, don't waste your money on these earphones, they are horrible, and i say that sparingly - deeply disappointed
I needed high quality headphones for my voiceover work and this do a great job of providing full quality audio and keeping out external sound
It's almost as good as wearing earplugs in terms of keeping out the noise when I'm editing
I can't complain, in fact I'm using the earpods right now as every day at work, the sound is great and the price is also excellent, they are comfortable and well made
Go and buy this earpods, you won't regret it
These buds have excellent sound quality, a low price tag, and look and feel great
Sony does a great job with their earbuds
Highly recommend these
The sound is very good for headphones at this price
Wires seem a bit thin but normal for this price
Working well so far,
Good product at a good price
I wanted a name brand and I have always had good luck with Sony  No complaints
These headphones work excellent and have some subtle attributes which you often don't think about until after you've received them and suddenly have problems because of it
I order for the price which is great at about $7
50 (including handling/delivery)  They limit you to three so (apparently) the shipping and handling they get per set covers their costs (and profit I might guess)
1) Size of headphone jack is small enough to use with my iPhone without taking the case off
Very important to me as I use headphones when I talk on my iPhone and taking the case off is not an option
I don't like Bluetooth headsets because they are too costly for the frequency with which I loose them as is true for decent sets of wired headsets with mics
So, I order and use these and simply have to replace them when I occasionally lose them (about once a month) or replace them when they do wear out (one buds stops working)
Needless to say my job is very active and I am extremely rough on headsets (dropping phone, knocking it off desk or car seat, constantly straining and stretching the cord and ear buds
)  These often make it three to four months whereas others I have ordered will fail within a month
2) the rubber used on the cord is flexible yet not overly grabby
Some headsets the wired are stiffy plastic which makes wrapping them up difficult and prone to stick out from your clothes and catch on things
Others have rubber that seams to almost stick to things and pull, catch or grab them when you go near them (like catching on things in your pocket (or even just the fabric of the pocket
)
Two minor suggestions for future models
The packaging is that stiff plastic that is very difficult to open cleanly without a pair off scissors (or you risk the possibility of damaging the headphones when it finally breaks free)
I imagine it's to prevent theft by removal in stores where they are sold
Also, I would like a 90 degree plug if possible while still maintaining the important thinness of the plastic around the headphone jack so case wouldn't have to be removed to use it
You can not expect that it can screen noise from environment, but it satisfies my requirement
I think it's worth
no thing nore
looks good, great sound for ten bucks, good fit in ear even if you don't shove em deep they stay, get em, good buy
These headphones were awesome when I first got them
However,  after only a month of use, the right headphone no longer works
I am highly disappointed that only the left one works now
One bud flamed out after 3 weeks of use
I do not advise purchasing this product under any circumstances at all
The  sound was excellent
I really liked the way they fit into you ear
I like them because they are very to carry with you where ever  you go
It has high quality and it is not expensive so I am very satisfied
The color is also very nice
You can hardly find better for the price
I've been using those for 4 months, they're light and work just fine
Been trying all the sub-$15 pairs, this is my fave
I'm super active, so I destroy and lose headphones weekly
This is at least my 6th pair of these Sonys
Needed to replace an old set of earphones because they were hurting my ears
I bought these hoping that they were comfortable, and at the same time, worked well
I got the best of both worlds
oredered on the 30th got em on the 6th i love these headphones
everytime i order on here the days go by so slow i swear it felt like i was waiting for weeks
I have no dislikes
They are very durable and they work great
They rarely get tangled and they are pretty flexible; two things that I like
Purchased these headphones for work and they relay great sound
Also, I have small ears and love the 3 options of ear plug sizes
Sony has always made fantastic hardware beating out all there competitors by far but they just dont advertise
the sound quality is great, the headphones are the most durable ive had so far
5 out of 5
I bought these to wear during my flight and they are just ok
The sound quality is not of the best quality
The provide different size ear piece covers which I didn't expect
You get what you pay for
They did what I needed so I give them 4 stars
im using these, while im writing this
listening to Kendrick Lamar, B*tch, Dont kill my vibe
sounds great
definety got wat i paid for
cheap and worth it
you wont regret buying these
This in-Ear headphone give me good sound
I am looking for a in-Ear headphone with sufficient distance from my laptop to my ear
The one met my requirement
Just purchased a set of the MDR-EX10LP in black
Basic info on myself, I am a DJ so I listen to music 24/7, thus I am a huge audiophile
My main concern when it comes to earbuds is fitment and sound quality
Right out of the packaging, they sounded great on both my Android and iPod (previously my iPhone 4 before I switched to the Android)
For the price, these earbuds are hard to beat
Awesome sound range, with excellent bass as well
To many headphones advertise, "BASS" but what you end up getting is drowned out sound quality with bass overkill and not enough mids and highs
These deliver all the ranges with just a bit more bass, without sacrificing mids and highs
These earbuds can easily go up against of the higher prices sets from the $40-$100
I've owned plenty of earbuds from Skull Candy, Sony XBA1, Logitech UE, to even off name brands that you can find at the stores
Considering the prices of these Sony buds, I'd easily choose them over any Skull Candy product soley based on build quality as with recent complaints of Skull Candy cheapening their products to save money
Fitment wise, they offer 3 different sets of Sony color coded silicone ear pieces
They fitting that came on the earbuds fit me perfectly, but you can tailor the fit based on the other sizes
They are snug and don't fall out on their own (based on normal activity and such)
The cord is the same rubbery type material that is on most headphones, so I foresee tangling as an issue
Additionally the cord makes mediocre noise when it brushes up against my clothing, however considerably less than other brands of the same price range
This has never really been a issue that bothered me
This itme is fairly good quality as i have purchased quite a few different types of ear phones
Nice sound
There is like no base and it sounds like the headphones aren't actually in my ears
The only good thing is that it is decent at blocking out sound
I love Sony
I have tried out and owned many of their headphones and other products
These in particular, Suck
The sound quality would be acceptable if the right earphone worked properly
I made sure to be careful while taking them out of the packaging, cleaned my ears, and still the right one was a dud
NOT recommend
Take some extra cash and buy some good ones
Wow
These were terrible
I was listening to music and the earbuds FELL OF THE CORD
What a rip off
I received the headphone and it didn't worked well in laptop, iPhone 4 and 5 both ones
Headphone pin had issue from 1st minute
Probably bad piece
Check instantly after you receive order
Never trust the seller
The Ultimate Ears 200 Noise-Isolating Earphones, Grey offers better sound (and slightly better construction) for just a little more
I would highly recommend spending the extra and getting the  Ultimate Ears 200vi Noise-Isolating Headset, Grey which include a remote
It's amazing how useful this is for pausing and changing tracks without having to fish your iPod out of your pocket
There is also a version of this same headset with controls available here Sony DREX12iP/BLK Phone Headset
These in ear headphones sound great
Why would you buy Beats for over 15x the price, and still worse quality
Beats hasn't even released technical specifications for their headphones
All they say is "Advanced audio sound
" If you are going to charge that much money Beats, I want to know what I'm buying
Unlike beats, these headphones do not muddy sound with absurd base
Even though base is improved with these earphones, the treble is clearly heard
All in all, I'm going to trust Sony, a company that has been making headphones for 30+ years, not some cheap celebrity endorsed headphones that are more of a scarf to wear around your neck to make a fashion statement than actual headphones
These have been the only ones that stay in my ear when I run, and I think they put out great sound
For a pair of $10 dollar earbuds, it does the trick
The range is great, the sound is nice and doesn't leak sound either
I normally have a huge problem with earbuds but these fit my ears fine and I have not had any issue with them
I go through headphones like crazy
I use them A LOT during a normal day, usually when I'm trying to sleep and not here my family making noise around me
I found these at staples and it was by a good brand I like
They were pretty cheap too
Well, a few months later, the left plug stops working
I honestly expected it to work a year
I've only had one earbud that lasted a year and was really cheap, but is no longer manufactured
The cable came loose
It works when I hold the cable and move it a little, but it no longer works normally
These sound good to me for an average user, but the durability was not very strong
If only I still had the warranty card
These are great earbuds
My teenaged grandson loves them
They are comfortable and he says the bass is very good, too
When these headphones work they are great
Help to drown out background noise very well and the sound quality is perfect
However they break very easily
I have had three sets so fair, first ones broke after a month of regular use
The second after a week, the final set was broken when I removed them from the packaging
Like I said they work great but are useless if they don't work, especially right out of the packaging
The good news is that Sony has broken the $30
00 price barrier for a basic in-ear phone for listening to acoustic music
The bad news is that, according to a Walmart associate, Sony is discontinuing these $15
00 models in retail stores
They are upgrading features to keep the price at $30
00+
Sony often pulls that when technology trickles down and causes lower prices
I suspect the negative reviews on this model are coming from hard rock, bass-preoccupied listeners, rather than acoustic listeners who prefer balanced, accurate sound
Any further reductions in price are a strong indication that these earphones will be discontinued soon
I don't know any other way of putting it but this item is awesome
I use it for immersion reading & with my iPhone for my tunes
This is a great headphone if your looking for a lengthy wire cord (as a HP desktop user, as the headphone jack could be far from my ears)
It's also cheap compared to other headphone so you won't feel to bad if break a few
The downside of the product is that it could have funky packaging (some are good, while some have a rubberband holding it's content) and I am not to sure about the durability of the product since I go through them every 3-4 months
These earbuds are very comfortable and have great sound
Too early to comment on durability but they seem to be well made
Loved the fit of these earbuds, but 6 months after purchase went to use and one of the ear buds fell off - no where to be found
I have no idea how this fell off since they are put on really tight
So now I need to buy a new pair to replace
I thought these headphones would be okay
i go to the gym alot so i wanted ones that would go in my ears so they wouldnt fall out while i was running
i also sweat alot so i had them for about a week and while i was running i went to put them in when they started falling out a little and one got sweat all over it so it stopped working
But if youre not going to work out in the them i highly reccomend this product, the sound is AMAZING and blocks out any outside noise, they broke fast but it was my fault
I am so amazed at the tremendous bass and sound coming from theseheadphones
Great price, and finally buds that fit my ear properly
I planto purchase two more pair before they are all out
I am not a tech guru but I am a music guru and I require good quality music when I work out
These are perfect because they have excellent sound quality, they stay in my ears and I won't be too bent out of shape if I lose them because the price is right
Definitely recommend for the gym
I received these after requesting them as a gift, they have amazing sound quality, very nice surround sound effect and are comfortable in my ears
For those who might be concerned, they are accompanied by three different sizes of rubber tips, these can be exchanged by squeezing firmly but not to hard on the equipped bud and slowly pulling straight off
The new size can then be pushed straight on to the tip, very simple
I bought these just to work out in so they wont fall out when running, very satisfied with the price and product
No problems, graeat sounding, and great price
I would buy the headphones again
Actually bought 2 pair, and the wife likes her headphones also
This ear phones have awesome sound quality, very affordable which makes a a very satisfied customer
+ + + + +
I bought these in December and I've already had to retire them because the left ear bud has stopped working entirely
I wish the company would replace them; it seems like there should be some sort of warranty for such a short period of time
These work great, they are exactly what I wanted, and they are comfortable
My husband also has some that he likes
I usually buy these in black at my local Target, but I saw these much cheaper on here except they were white
I don't care about the color, so I bought them
Great price, great product
c:
is perfect
it is what i was looking for
i got it just in time so everything is fine
thanks
I don't generally write reviews, but these head phones are too awesome not to
They are incredibly comfortable
I listen to music on my kindle, and the sound is sharp and clear at any volume
If the volume is maxed out, (even if I have one earbud out), no sound can be heard from the outside
Great product
I highly reccomend
These sound  tinny and a little harsh to my ears
The cheap earbuds that came with my 56 dollar Sansa MP3 player sound better
it have an spectacular soundi recommend it and Powerful bass and high resolution trebleSecure fit hybrid silicone earbuds
excellent buds  high quality sound
not cheaply made
works great  very very happy with this recent purchase
thanks all very much
Bought these on vacation to listen to my Samsung tablet
Downloaded an EQ app just to make them listenable
Hopefully I will never forget my AT fc700 cans again
Strident, bright, tinny, hollow sounding
Comfort and quality sound
Perfect
15 more words required to complete this review
I did not need these
I don't think I will do anymore reviews
it's okay
The sound quality is okay
good for the prices
Even though I wish it could be cheaper:)
haha
I really love these headphones they fit my everyday listening needs
I recommend this for everyday use go and buy this product
Sony product for ear buds, sounds greatn fits well, very comfortable
The best earbuds I've ever had
Recommend thid product
I bought white one
The design is nice and the qualities of sound is good
The package is really good
I needed my own set of ear buds and these work great
I use them with my phone to listen to music and while I am sitting at my computer
The overall sound is very good, from bass to treble, and they stay put in my ears while I am walking, even in a stiff breeze
The set I bought came with extra plastic covers in case any got lost
(No problem in that area
)  These have a very long cord
Bought this as replacement for headphones that came with the Samsung Galaxy player
While the sound is more clear and rich, the noise isolation is worse than with the Samsung headphones
I hear every person on the bus, and worst of all traffic noise
Great only when in a quiet environment
Gave 4 stars because the sound (when it's quiet) is definitely the best of all headphones in the price range I tried
i like the headphones put i think that the one thing they get you with is the ship they over pier it so i want be get headphones of of amazon but the were good i still have them the work fine
They're pretty comfortable and the sound is good
They have good bass response but the highs are so prominent that they cover up the bass sometimes
If you change your EQ to something with more bass it can make it sound better
I personally like strong bass and these left me wanting more
I really enjoy these headphones, and think they have great sound
However, I would not recommend them for runners simply because the wire between the splitter and the ear piece creates some feedback when it bounces
If you can find a way to steady this part of the wire, or simply hold it away from your body as you run, it is not an issue
Despite these headphones not being ideal for running, I absolutely plan on purchasing these again when I need a replacement
These are the best ear buds and the price can not be beat
The sound quality is superb
They are comfortable and durable
I order this item a week ago and I was patiently waiting
the item arrive early but i open the package and tried the headphones and to founf out that one of the piece work
i am seriously upset and no longer will buy at this product at Amazon
Sony is a big brand, when I found it actually sell low price headphone I was curious about the quality
it turned out it still keeps the Sony's quality
I had those ear-buds since four weeks and they still work and the sound quality is very very clear and loud :)
It finally happened like so many pairs of ear buds, these went through the washing machine and dryer
They work just fine still
A very good headphone for the price
The leads are long and that helps out a lot
The ear buds are OK
A very good value
If you need deluxe earbuds, these are not for you
These have reliably good (not amazing) sound, and are easy to fit
I have a constant problem with most earbuds which fall right out of my ears; most are too huge for me
These fit perfectly, they don't budge, and just fine for listening while commuting (or anything else)
A great value
I had the dark blue pair for a while until the cord broke (cat chewed it)
I looked here for a replacement but ended up purchasing the white ones because they were $3 cheaper
So far, they have been perfect and they shipped extremely quickly
Purchased this to replace a broken pair of Altec Lansing's because I wanted something cheap
This turned out to be a great product
I go to the gym frequently and the ear buds fit snug without falling out
Due to frequent use, I expected these to break after 3-4 months, but I've owned them for over 1 year
It gets a 5 star for durability and the length of the cord, but lacks any bass for all you "bassheads" out there
The price was right
I thought I'd go with a set of Sony hoping for a little better quality than some of the other no names
They're light on the bass
lower efficlency (less volume) and sound quality not as good as the COBY ones that I was trying to replace
Works for me
sound clarity good with good bandwidth and no hissing  noise problem and using it since five months
These are great for the price, good sound and very comfortable
I was impressed how much sound is blocked out so you can hear your music perfectly
I'm happy with them
The cord is a little flimsy but that's because of the price level
Otherwise they work great and the buds are sufficient to block out other noise
They are easily taken off so be careful when storing
Sony includes 2 additional sets of buds
Good bass and are very comfortable I recommend these buds for people who are willing to spend about $12 brand new or used for less
Great earbuds
I bought two pairs
One for my daughter and her android phone the other for my daughter and her ipod
My daughter with the android phone works great she loves them
The pair for the iPod doesn't work at all
So I needed in expensive headphones so I can watch tv while the hubby is on his Mac, He is able to do whatever and I do not have to over listen what hes doing
I have all sony gear
so the headphones are a match
I wish they were louder
but that is BECAUSE i am getting older i think
if it's too loud you're too old
if it's not loud enough
you've made it
:)
Ver nice headphones
love the sound that they make
I saw them at the store for double the price, happy :)
Perfect for gym  fits great and looks good
Quality of sound is OK Its little bit better than my old ipod headphones
The reason that i am giving 4 stars is the cord quality, apple headphones has much better cords
OK for the price paid
I can hear all the music
The highs and lows
Very light
They don't pull on your ears
These are great
they seem to be pretty good value in the box you get several different sized tips so you can find one that fits your ear
from the jack to the buds it is about 4ft long so plenty of cord to move around
they have a great sound and a very nice bass I have had mine for about a year now and they are still going strong and they seem to hold up pretty good
for the price these are great ear buds if I had a choice I would diffidently buy them again I highly recommend them
Didn't expect the buds to be so little honestly
because of this, they can be uncomfy from time to time
Other than that, I'm a happy customer
This is my favorite earphones
I bought these earphones because my old ones broke because my dog got a hold of them after a year
Great buy
Inexplicably, one side of the headphones stopped working after 2 days
This product is not worth the time & expense to return
I love Sony's earphones
They don't break easily
I bought them for at least 6 months now, and it is still working
Great buy at $8
If you look for a pair earphones that won't fall out when you run/workout, this is it
Great product
Excelente articulo, cumple con lo requerido
Es de bajo costo y con la calidad que uno busca confiando siempre en productos SONY
A stonking set of ear buds for cheap money
I've bought many pairs and given them to friends with earbuds less worthy
I tried these headphones in lieu of the normal panasonic brand that I buy, these don't sound as good as the panasonic ear buds but their decent
The price and shipping were great
I would purchase from this merhcant again
I bought these after reading that they worked well for jogging
Not so much, however
They are no more stable than my last pair
But the sound is good and price was fair
I just need to find that magical bud that stays put on a run
The audible pleasure is astounding
The wavelengths breathe through your bones from your ears
I am going to spend all the time I can with them
Don't buy this garbage
Not even worth a dollar
Sound quality is terrible
Can't believe someone would manufacture & even attempt to sell something like this
What a waste of money
All I wanted was a pair of headphones that stay in and sound OK for listening to podcasts and occasional music
This was it
Excellent Product, great price, faster than expected delivery
So far so good, they sound great and fit my ears perfectly
Tip of the day: the white ones are cheaper than the other colours
I ordered these because of the low cost and the brand
They are not for the music affecionado, but for me, they're just fine
I would recommend these for most people
Considering their price, these earphones are a great value
No, they don't sound as well as my Sennheisers, which cost me more than ten times
They fit nicely in my ears but I don't like the unequal length of the left/right ear cables
I find this design to be a nuisance
These headphones are very comfortable
They fit in my ear snug and don't come off easily
The quality of the sound is great too
I would definitely recommend these to anyone
They were a great price and shipped to me quickly
EDIT: It's now December 2013
I bought these headphones in January of 2013 and they are still going
Love them
I bought a pair of these about three months ago at the local superstore
They are attached to a single, immobile, device at all times, so they don't have to take the abuse of being wound up, bagged, repeatedly jacked in and out, etc
Even so, the left earbud has developed a short that causes all sound to fail with the slightest head movement
I didn't pay attention to the warranty period prior to this issue, but I wish I would've
Regardless of price, a three month lifespan for a pair of headphones that have been subject to light use and zero abuse is not acceptable
It is hard to make out from the pictures, but there is no reinforcement in the place where the wire enters the earbud
A grommet or a bit of shrink-tape or something would've probably prolonged the product's lifespan immensely
Some of the competitors offer one year warranties, and I will choose their products in the future
That said, the quality of the sound was adequate for a product in this price range
I found the bass to be a bit heavy and the highs to be muted, but I suppose that depending on the source material this may be a feature instead of a drawback
As with most cheap earbuds, the design and material of the cables and their connection to the earpieces causes an obnoxious amount of sound to be transmitted whenever the cables rub against clothing
I would be willing to pay a little more for earbuds that ship with special noise-free coatings
I was really excited at first but it was kind of disappointing because it doesnt have that good beat to it
I mean like when theres music theres always beat in songs
So i didnt really enjoy when i am listening to music
I traded this headphone for one of my friends for a IPOD headphone ones
I listen to music a lot
Ordered this earphone only for less than two months, with very light use; however, one side of earphone died right after when the return window expired
i bought these at walmart months ago, i wa looking for skullcandy titans but these looked like the best they had
i bought them for $15, and i am pleased with them
the sound quality is great for their price, never thought the 8mm drivers would sound this good
the bass is low because they are small, but that should be expected
if you have an EQ on your phone/mp3 player it can kick up the bass, my mp3 player has a higher end EQ so it does have some decent bass to it
if you're looking for just some cheaper headphones to get you by these would be a good selection, but there are better ones out there
if you're a basshead and you want bass don't pick these up there not the ones you'd want
but overall these are high quality
only concern in the fact that when i put these in my pocket and pulled them out the ear thing came off, could be a little tighter so they don't do that
these are comfortable and come in small/med
/large sizes for the ear pieces
After hearing the OEM Samsung earbuds
these don't even compare
Don't waste your money on these, go for JVC or something else
I purchased these Sony ear buds as a possible replacement to the generic pair that Came with my Sansa Clip
They are the older round style with the foam over the ear piece, which aren't too comfortable as well as not staying in if you turn your head
In terms of comfort and staying in, these Sony buds work great
They come with three different adapters for different ear canal sizes, sit easily in the ear without moving, and are also nice for blocking out background noise
In that respect they are a 5 star product
In terms of sound, I'm very disappointed
The are very tinny sounding and lack any kind of warmth
I would expect a name brand product to at least be on par with the what-ever throwaway set that comes with an MP3 player, but the generic Sansa buds are warmer and have a better bass response
I know a thing or two about audio, so I know ear buds won't sound like a pair of pro audio monitors, but these aren't in the same ball park
To try to loosen up the voice coils I thought a breaking in period might be necessary, so for a week I left them attached to my PC at night with some pink or brown noise running
This plus a couple hours of regular use still didn't get me much
If I have to wait 4 years (the age of the Sansa ear buds) for these to sound better, there's a problem
They were not expensive, but now I have to look for something else
Pros:Good priceEasy to find in most retail and online storesComfortableCons:The high frequencies are brittle, there is little warmth to the mids, and the bass is not good at allBreaking them in doesn't seem to help the toneUpdate:If you swap out the tips of these ear phones so there is a better seal in your ear, the bass performance increases noticeably
Unfortunately the mids are still very scooped
So you can get better bass out of these if you get some proper fitting tips, but you won't get a full natural sound
Great headphones, great bass and overall sound and at a price that is cheaper than most other headphones
Also sturdily built
really good for the prices and has more base than my more expensive ones
good deal
would buy again  thx
I have been using the MDR-E10's for years and was pretty happy with them
But one day I decided to buy these MDR-EX10's for a few dollars more to upgrade
I was shocked at how low the volume was
I had my laptop volume all the way up and the sound was still low
They seem to be pretty clear though with a brighter sound than the E10's
The reason for being terrible is quality
These do sound decent especially for 15$ I paid at best buy
The quality however is the horrible end of these headphones, my first pair lasted 5-6 months before the right ear stopped working
Warranty, got a new pair
This new pair has lasted my maybe 2-3 months and the jack is issues connecting the right speaker
While this may last for a short period they are terrible in quality, by sound they are decent
Not to mention the use of the headphones were mild
If they work for you great but I've had two pairs and both have "broke" on me
These earbuds are very comfortable and they have great sound
The shipping was prompt as well, and I hope they last longer than pairs have in the past
Sound quality is good for the price
Good quality considering the price I paid for them
Comfortable, stays in the ear well (3 different sizes of ear buds included)
It's been over a year now and I found these earbuds to be much more durable than the Frogz earbuds
The Frogz earbuds last me anywhere from 1-3 months, but these Sony buds have lasted over a year
The Frogz buds definitely have much better sound quality, but lack the durability of these Sony buds
With free shipping,the best price anywhere
Arrived quickly and am enjoying using them
Reasonably priced and great sound
I am happy with the amount of bass they can give out
I use these everyday, while I'm walking, running, or at my desk on my computer, and I bought these back in July 2012
They are still working now (end of January 2013), and are in the same condition and quality as when I first bought them
I love them so much, I bought  another pair back in November 2012 to keep at work so that I would never forget them for when I go to work
They also have the added bonus of having an 'L' shaped connector, which is great for maintaining the integrity of the wiring close to the connector
I choose Sony because they are a trusted name but these headphones are the worst
The slightest movement causes them to fall out of my ears
Not good for use while exercising or even walking
These are not made very well
The rubber ear parts fall off alot and the sound quality is not good
Buy cheap and most often get cheap
The right ear bud blew out within three weeks of owning it
I will be sticking with earbuds from 5 Below from now on
Well if you are thinking about high class super bass then go ahead by $150
because this is less than $10
Its very good for the people like me who don't use regularly and only for travelling and some occasionally
I don't have any complain for this headphone and if this last 1 year and money is worth what you are paying
Pros:-White cord-Blocks out sound really well-Good soundCons:-Feels like you are plugging your ears, you can hear your teeth scraping against each other really loudly, you hear yourself swallow, and if the cord rubs against anything, it sounds like someone waving sheet metal around
-Doesn't have a button to skip to the next song, or to pause
I have to get my phone out everytime to switch a song
I wouldn't buy these again, but I suppose they would be good if you want to listen to things in a very noisy environment, since they do shut out outside noise very well
The sound quality is clear and great for the price
These sound a lot better than my Apple Earpods, truth be told
The next day that i use it one of the earphones stop work and i bought two more counting it and still the same probles but the sound is perfect is just the Calida
I'm about to order my 10th pair of these headphones
That's not to say they break easy, I put them through a ton of abuse
I use them over 8 hours a day during the summer where they moderately drown out the noise of heavy duty lawn mowers and other machinery
In and out of my ears, in pockets, thrown about, and they tend to take a few trips through the washer and dryer and still work
One ear bud usually stops working 3-5 months into the hell I put them through
For the price and how good of quality they are, they are worth every cent
At roughly $ 10 I cannot go wrong getting so much use out of them then simply throwing them out if they are to fail
You get what you pay for, I guess
I was using Skull candys for years until I decided to try something different
These lasted me 3-4 months until one day I put them in, and they have that horrible scratching noise no matter what type of music I am listening to
They're basically useless now
Spend a little extra and get some that will last, so you won't need to buy new ones 4 months later
I'm going back to skull candy for my cheap headphone purchases
Wonderful quality
I wear them when I run at the gym everyday and unlike most headphone, they project the music great and don't fall out of my ears
Great sound
However within 2 to 3 days i noticed the right headphones writing was being faded away
Not a big deal for me as of right now but would be hard to tell if it was right or left if both faded
For this price, the quality of sound is good
it completely removes the outside noise
works fine with samsung galaxy smart phones
I use it for my work out and they perfectly fit the ears
would recommend this for everyone
Sound was great but wires are so slim the left earbud stopped working totally after two months and I didn't even use them that much
I bought these ear buds primarily for use when walking to class or going for runs
At $8, I wasn't expecting much
I was happily surprised by the sound quality, comfort, and build quality of these head phones
I am by no means an audiophile or anything of the sort, but as someone who is rather hard on my ear buds, I've gone through quite a few pairs
These ear buds could easily compete with others in the $20-30, maybe even $40 price range
They aren't perfect (and at this price they shouldn't be) but they're clear and loud, have great range and the capability to play any genre you could want
They also don't skimp on bass as many cheap ear buds do
They are extremely comfortable, I have small ears and often have problems with fit but the smallest tips that come with these fit my ears perfectly
I can't say a whole lot about durability as I've only owned these for about a month, but as I said I can be pretty hard on my ear buds and so far they show no signs of wear
The build quality seems to be great for a product this cheap and I'm confident they'll last me a while
The worst I've ever bought
Don't expect to have them in your ears if you're doing any kind of physical activity
The lows disappear into the tin-can highs, and the terribly fitted ear buds slip from your ears every five minutes as your futile attempts at jamming them into your ear canals fail
I replaced my Ipod ear buds with the Sony and they are much better for the sound of your tunes,
very good experience, I recommend it widely, the shipment arrived on time
the product was exactly the that I wanted
This was a great purchase
We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others
The experience was positive
I really liked these headphones they sound good and unlike many other headphones I have owned they didn't pop
They have a great bass for earbuds
these headphones provide great sound for the price
I have used them for a couple weeks now with no issues
I like the sound quality alot
However I have small ears and even with the small ear pieces on, the rubber part just doesn't have that super comfy feel to it
I don't understand why these earbuds get good reviews
The sound is described by some reviewers as thin
This actually means the earbuds aren't very efficient and you have to turn the volume up several notches to equal most earbuds I have used
I bought these as a replacement for a pair of Panasonic earbuds that got lost
I don't think these earbuds are as good as a pair of $5
00 no-name from China that I bought before I bought these
Yes the sound is thin - meaning you have to turn up the volume
The base is barely adequate
The fit average
Nearly no sound sound suppression
In addition the cord is very, very cheap
All in all a C-
I rarely write reviews, but I have to say these are really good
I've owned jvc, a lot of skull candy and other brands of in ear headphones, but these are the best sounding and most comfortable ones I've had to date (compared to others in the same price range)
Earbuds worked just fine at first, but within two weeks, one earbud lost sound
Thought I found a great deal on a Sony product, but was mistaken
I work in an office where we can listen to headphones while working
Prior to these I tried all sorts of earbuds and headphones and they all had their share of problems
Either the noise bled too much and everyone could hear what I was listening to, or they weren't comfortable enough to wear for 8 hours a day
These, however, are perfect
I have worn these all day, every day, for the 8 months, and they sound AMAZING* (* to me, if you have some super strength hearing maybe you won't like it, but to me it's AMAZING)
They also fit perfectly and do not hurt one bit
I bough them from Best Buy for about $15, so the price here is definitely a plus
Thin treble sound with almost no bass
Seinhauser headphones blow these away
Why ruin your music experience with poor sound
It is not worth it
Also, those who like to sing along will hear their own voice very loudly with buds that block the ear canals

Don't fit into my ears
A good thing is they are sound reducer and quality of sound is very good and clear
No noise and they look good
I don't like the shape of the pin and the pin does not look long lasting
Good but not great
I loved them
Until one side stopped working not even two months into usage
Why do earphones kick the bucket so fast when you use them constantly
Someone please invent earphones that are resistible for every day gym users
I can not use ear buds; they fall out of my ear
These are extremely stable on me; they came with the medium size and I had to change it to the small
I use them mostly for books on tape; the sound is great
Definitely would buy them again
These Headphones are comfortable, light and have a great sound quality, mainly the bass
It's a real good choice
I do recommend that
I love these headphones
They're cheap
They sound decently enough
They're comfortable
Why only two stars
The earbuds come off far too easily
I had gone through 2 pairs before finally wising up and super-gluing the buds
I figured that would solve all problems, but it only solved one
The other problem is that one ear will eventually lose sound
It will happen, it is just a matter of time
The first 2 pairs I threw out for "lack of buds
" The last 3 pairs I have thrown out due to lack of sound in one ear after about 2 months time
I don't abuse my headphones, either
It just happens mysteriously
So, you might be willing to take the risk at the low cost
You won't be disappointed if you glue on the buds and only need them for a couple months
I'm looking for another solution
I'm no audiophile, but these set of buds work pretty well under normal circumstances of listening to MP3s and movies on the computer
Although the lines are a bit thin and somewhat delicate, the sound quality is better than other cheaper alternatives that range from $7 and down
This set is simple, sleek, and fits the purpose
I'm satisfied =)
Excellent product, light, smalls and powerful
The beats and bass lines are great and clear
Recommended 100% if rock and electronic music touch you
This product is decent
It's not crappy at all, and it's just what I would expect in Sony earphones
I'm very satisfied with these earphones
This was the first set of ear buds that I have owned
I got mine from Walmart though about two week ago
The quality of the product is great
When I first started using them, MY EARS ITCHED like crazy
I mean I could not listen to music for no more than 30 sec without taking a bud out and itching the inside of my ear
It was horrible
Today I came on Amazon to give a bad review, but then in the product description I noticed the mention of S,M,L sized buds that came with it
I remembered these, but I thought it was replacement buds
They weren't
My ear canals are super small so I popped on the small buds and have been happy and content ever since
Long story short
CHANGE THE BUD SIZE TO BEST FIT YOUR EAR
The End
Their build quality is pretty good and I really mean it
I have them over 8 months and they are still working
After the 7th month sound quality started to get bad but it is okay
I used them around 2-3 hours everyday and it took my 7 months to destroy their drivers
I mean they are really good
Also I believe they have 1 or 2 years guaranty, Im not sure which
SO even if you destroy their drivers like me, you can send them to Sony (US ONLY) and they send you new ones
I've been a long time Sony headphone customer for many years
It seems that one of the best kept secrets of the industry is the fact the Sony makes great sounding headphones and they don't charge a lot for it
These ear buds are cheap (I define cheap as under 20 bucks)
I think they get overlooked as many people would look at them and think they have perhaps the same sub par sound as the included ear phones in many of today's electronics based on the price
They are are wrong
The advantage of in ear buds is that they are the original "noise cancelling" ear phones
Why
Because they plug your ear like ear plugs
This gives them a distinct advantage as most of the noise you hear is from the headphones
What makes these buds good
The tonal quality is good
Highs, mids, and lows are distinct and separate
The range is nice
The bass is strong
Sure you could get other buds that have stronger bass (even Sony has some that have stronger bass), but I felt this was enough to be quite present but not overpowering
I have a discerning ear
That being said I like my "lows" more then I like my "highs"
I was not disappointed
The only con I can see is the quality of the wire might not be as good as others
Seems kind of thin even compared to my previous Sony ear buds
Overall it shouldn't be a problem as I don't really plan to wrap them tight or anything
Could you buy better ear buds
Sure
Bose, Sony, Klipsch and others offer them at premium prices
Could you buy better ear buds under 20 dollars
No way
Great sound for a reasonable price
The different earpieces that were supplied as part of the parckage worked fine, and allowed for an even more comfortable listening experience
These have lasted several times longer than any Skullcandy earbuds I've had, and they sound better
All the headphones I've used are the inexpensive sort (I'm no audiophile), and these are probably the best
They sound clear, with good bass that's not overpowering
They perform well for my fairly diverse music collection
Fast delivery
I received these a few days early
Sound is quite nice with clear-but-not-tinny highs and adequate bass that will not make your ears bleed
I like my ears and want them to last
:)Comes w/ 3 sets of flexi plugs for custom sizing
Overall, very nice earphones at a great value
I have paid twice the price for earphones of equal sound and quality, (can you say Skull Candy
)and highly recommend Sony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones
These buds are a good deal for the price
great fit with a nice seal to block out ambient noise
not much bass, so if you're looking for some thumping earbuds, these are a pass, but for those just looking for an affordable pair of earphones with above average sound quality, look no further
I love these headphones so much that I bought two extra pairs in case they break or I lose them
The sound quality is superb
I have tried some of the high quality Bose and Beats headphones before and I really don't think there is any noticeable difference in sound quality
The price is also great at $12
The pair I have has lasted me probably a year and a half and before these I went through headphones quickly
Besides the great sound quality, they are extremely comfortable, they stay in my ears nicely and don't hurt my ears at all
The only thing that I don't like about them is that the silicone earbuds seem to shrivel up a little bit and get smaller when it gets very cold (under 20 degrees F)
When it gets that cold they don't stay in my ears very well and I have to push them back in my ears every few minutes
But if you don't plan on being outside in sub-freezing temperatures for long periods of time, I highly recommend these headphones
The earbuds were exactly what I wanted them to be, they fit great in my ears, excellent sound
definitely worth buying
I always had trouble with similar products with similar prices from Skullcandy
They never lasted more than 2 weeks without one ear bud failing
Since I've switched to Sony, the quality of the sound and durability has been an excellent value for the price
I'm very happy with this product
These are great for those people wanting really decent sounding ear buds that will last a while and are comfortable to wear
The multiple bud cup sizes will fit anyone, I usually have a huge issue with fitting buds in, but these fit just fine
Sound quality isn't stellar, but definitely better than any other $15 buds can give you
Definitely recommend them to anyone needing an interim ear bud or just don't want to spring for the expesnive ones
That's not saying much
I put them in my computer and played around with the graphic equalizer
These headphones have a bizarre sound profile, with basically no low-end bass and weird mid-range
the frequency response for the size of the headphones is simply great, you can adjust the headphones size with the size of your ears, blocking the noice from the environment where you are
I use these as my running set
They fit the ear well and seem to be unaffected by sweating
Sound quality is good for the price
No buyers remorse on this purchase
I bought these because I almost always buy Sony products and I've been really satisfied with another reasonably priced (~$30) pair of earbuds from Sony, but these are seriously horrible
I thought I had lost some of my hearing when I put these in
Turns out I have not, I just bought really terrible headphones
Buy these if you feel like throwing $13 down the drain, and then throwing $13 earbuds in the trash
This is my second pair of these after couple years of use on my old sony earbuds
I dont wear them 24/7 but I do use them alot
Around the house, work, mowing whatever
They just finally bit the dust one day when I got caught outside mowing the yard and it was like a bucket of water started pouring out of the sky
=)At anyrate for 15 bucks these are solid all around great sound quality and easy on the ears
I have small ears and these are the best cheap kind I have found so far
If your looking for something better they make them but they come with a price tag too
Stick with these if your on a budget you wont be sorry
Nothing spectacular but they work quite well and with good sound
I've been using them for roughly a month and am hoping the L-shaped jack will lengthen the life of them comparatively to those with a straight jack, with which i get about a 3 months life span
These headphones are very good for the money
they fit well with a choice of three different size ear inserts and the sound stays crisp and clear even at higher volumes
I got a pair of the black earbuds from a major store that has a great refund policy
I paid $15
First thing I noticed when I opened it was how thin the wires are
Feels flimsy and cheap like they'd snap in half if tugged a little too hard
You know the type, the kind you'd expect to find wired with generic 'buds
The little thing that slides up and down under the chin helps to keep the thin wires from flapping around in the wind against my neck is helpful
Big whoop
The medium sized ear pieces are a perfect fit for my ears; I tried removing one to test out another size to be sure, and it was EXTREMELY difficult to pull off the rubber; it felt like it was about to rip in half
They fit VERY tight onto the earbuds and removing them too many times will definitely rip apart the fragile rubber
glad it didn't rip mine but it did stretch the rubber pretty far
I decided it was too risky to test another size and immediately it back on
Goes on easy
As for the plug, it has the right angle design
that means much more stress will be put onto the thin flimsy wires at the plug, which is a VERY common cause for failure I've experienced in the past
There is a prevelent myth that says this style will relieve stress from the jack itself because those whiners think that jacks going bad is more common than the wires wearing out
WRONG
Cheap jacks are cheap jacks, they will wear out in no time despite how it's used
As long as you've got solid hardware to work with, all you need is a solid pair of 'phones
These will not stand up to the test of time
Ok, so now I have it
It fits great, but wires at the plug will wear out quick
If the audio quality is good enough, I would keep it
But, here's the deal with the audio quality:My primary concern was frequency response
It is listed as 8 - 22,000 Hz
Using some audio engineering software, I generated some low frequency tones starting with 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 Hz
The actual lowest response I could get to work is only 20 Hz
That means the lower bass frequencies of my music will be totally lost
I didn't bother checking the high end of the range
Overall, the audio quality was exactly the same as the Skullcandy Dub earbuds, which has 10 mm drivers, max power of 30 mW, and a listed low freq
response of 20 Hz
Even though the Sony earbuds say it can handle up to 100 mW of power, cranking up the volume still doesn't pump out the extra low bass frequencies that I should be able to hear
and my hearing is more than fine; sometimes too perfect
I've already taken them back now after trying them out for a few weeks
My next pair to sample is a JVC Marshmallow HA-FX30-B, which has a similar frequency range of 8 Hz - 20,000 Hz
Conclusion: the Sony buds are "ok" because it's better than nothing, but it's not what I paid for
Serves me right for thinking Sony might have started to make good 'phones again
So I was hesitant to buy in ear headphones and ended up getting 2 different brands
This was one of the cheaper ones I found and they work well for what they do
PROS:* Good sound reproduction
* Labeled clearly on the outside, plus a notch on one to distinguish it quickly by touch* A cord connector that prevents excess tangling of the headphones* 3 sizes provided of headphone coversCONS:* WILL FALL OUT WHEN JOGGING (at least on my ears)That one con is enough to take the ear-buds from a 4 to a 3, otherwise I recommend them
- jst bought this product as well , nicce product is all i can really say, keep up the good work -
This item was received as described, and works great
For the price, it was an excellent buy, and I would recommend this item to anyone looking for a cheap headphone solution
I just bought a pair of these last night and they're terrible
I like having the bass up but whenever I play a song with bass, I hear crackling in my ears
Now I have to go through the headache of trying to get my money back
This is not worth the $15
My advice: save your money and keep looking
love these sony headphones and for the price you can't go wrong
i usually go with a wider range than the typical 20-20k Hz and when i see a price tag of 15 or less, i think of it as a great deal
I bought these on sale at a well-known office supply store
The MDR-EX10LP has a tinny sound with very little bass
They are acceptable for speech but not for music
Of course, at this price range one cannot expect high fidelity
The earbuds included free with my Sansa clip are far superior
If you have an iPod and like the headphones, you're one of the rare few
these are an inexpensive replacement
I bought these because I am a fan of Sony products and I wanted them for the gym
I ended up using them mostly with my mp3 player on my phone and I can say that the sound/audio quality is great
I have every kind of music, techno, heavy metal, pop, soft/hard rock, dance and instrumental,
etc
Everything sounds perfect
As far as bass, treble, mid/low/high range
I hear it all
I use my headphones almost everyday for at least an hour and I can say it is definitely doing the job for me
The only issue I have is the earbuds sometimes need to be pushed back in my ears from time to time
Yes, they do have 3 sizes
I tried all of them and the smallest feels best, but like i said they don't always stay in for me
I hope this helped you out
These are comfortable, durable, and block outside noise well, but the sound is rather shrill like many others have said, making the overall sound quality pretty bad if you are an audio enthusiast like I am
If you bought these and hate them and are looking online to see their reviews like I am doing right now
at least check out this modification I did below before throwing or giving them away
First, let them play at a moderately high volume all night hooked up to your computer (not so loud they distort though) so the speaker/ driver inside loosens up which improves the bass quality
Then the next day get out your super glue and apply a thin layer or two of glue all over the little black foam filters  until little to no sound comes through after it dries
THEN, get a sewing needle and carefully poke 2 or 3 holes through each filter for the sound to be able come through which will be more balanced/ less shrill
Just be careful not to poke so far that you puncture the speaker on the other side
These do have deep and clear bass which is there, you just can't hear it till you tone down the treble a lot
Make sure you also have a good seal in your ear with the proper size tips
This modification worked for me and has now turned these into more enjoyable earbuds
Sony designs other earbuds that I own this way (the sony pq6 model) and they sound great so that is where I got the idea for these which are somewhat similar in design but lack the pinholes
I enjoy these headphones quite a lot, the three different ear piece sizes are really helpful and fit my ear really well
They have relatively good sound quality although you can hear your music through them if you have it loud
The physical quality is so-so, though
They only usually last about 2-4 months
I had to buy a new pair to replace my old ones after one side stopped working, which seems to happen a lot
Bought this earphone because I used to have a sony in ear and it was pretty good
Terrible purchase
The sound in completely dead and flat
No bass at all
Even after 40+ hours of burn in, nothing changed
Only good point about this item is the price
But paying $5 more you can buy something 1000% better
These Sony Headphones sound better then any other earphones ive owned even better then the previous Skullcandy's i owned and also cheaper
Goood Headphones
Nice sound with compact style = awsome headphones overall
I am able to say that within the first 5 mins of receiving this product I am more than happy
I love the quality and the tone of all my music through this earphone
If you think skullcandy are good earphones you are going to be completely blown away
Shipping came before they promise, which is always good
Earphones are completely untouched brand new
these headphones are long enough and the sound is good
I have lost them though :/ They were in very good condition
Work great
Sound awesome, and the length is ideal for what I use them for
but found that the L fits much better in my right ear, and the R in my left
Strange
Love these
I am no audiophile, so when I say they sound good--that's definitely a lay perspective--and they sound fine to me
They fit my ears which is a big plus--I hate hard earbuds, especially the stock Apple earbuds
My ears are not shaped like that--so they hurt
These don't
Great price and quick delivery
I can't bring myself to spend a ton on ear buds that get lost/trashed so easily when taking them everywhere
So I've been looking for a cheap, comfortable set of buds with good sound quality
This is them
I've tried several that I didn't like, mostly because the mids were all funky
Either too much low mids and they were muddy, not enough mids for a scooped sound, or too much high mids for a honky sound
The mid and highs of these Sony's are fantastic
I wish there was a little more bass but for the price I can't complain, and I can always boost the bass from my phone which is what I do and its fine
These are a great deal
These headphones deliver pretty good bass, and are (in my opinion) the best headphones for this much money
I got these at Walmart about a year ago for 15$ and I gotta say, theses are my favorite so far
The pads that come with it are very comfortable, I can listen I music for about 8 hours until I have to take them off
They leak sound if you get ear wax in them, (yeah I know, gross) and don't sound that good, but for me just take a q tip and do swirl motions on the part were the sound comes out and they're good as new
(I can't remember the name of it right now) The cord is pretty good, and is just the right length for putting an iPod in your pants pocket
I only have one complaint about it, it tangles super easily
But hey, what do you get for ten dollars
For me, since my ears are small, the earbud comes out pretty easily if I'm walking or something
If you touch the end of it when it's in your ear, it makes a really super loud noise in your ear, which is kindof annoying when you're putting it in your ear or it's rubbing on your coat
The noise cancelation is pretty good
When I ride on the school bus, and it has the chains on, I can only hear a faint tire noise
(Which Is saying a lot, it's about as loud as a train going by haha) As for the rubbing noise, if you rub the cord to, it makes the same noise
I'm sorry this review is scattered and not organized, but I'm writing these things as I notice them
(I'm listening to them right now) The highs are pretty good too, but the bass is probably the best part of these headphones
Best pair of backup headphones or cheap ones
Very effective, good-looking
I am very satisfied with the product
I recommend it for its functionality
Full trade my expectations, interesting purchase
These headphones perform as advertised; good sound and great durability
I wear them when working out and they have no problem working when sweaty
I just recently lost my apple earbuds
I saw the good reviews for this and thought they would be a good replacement
I was wrong
These reviews are misleading
I'm kind of angry and baffled at all these reviews with a high rating
These are the worst ear headphones I've ever used
- No Bass- Cheap materials- Awful soundI would only take these if someone payed me to take them
And then I would use them for cordage
The Sony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones is great
It's loud, zeros in on the bass when listening to from your computer or phone, although my computer does not give out a loud sound since the volume only goes to a certain max, the sound is still crisp and clear
If you use a receiver, it will probably sound louder
Thanks seller
Awesome product
Ive gone through countless pairs of earbuds in my days
After buying one pair of these, they have already outlasted any other pair ive ever owned by over 9 months now, but are also the best sounding pair ive ever worn that cost less than an arm and a leg
5/5, will buy again when i eventually lose or break my current pair (so far about 13 months and still going strong)
So I got these headphones as a last resort after my last 6 or so pairs broke due to earbuds shorting out/ plastic edges falling off
I have to say that the quality of sound will not disappoint: amazing bass and crystal clear sound, especially for the price
The design is sturdy and very comfortable in my ears, so no pain at all
Also loved that there is a protruding dot on the left earbud to allow you to quickly put them in the right ears
Thought that was a ice touch
Had to give it only 4 stars though because when I put them on today the left earbud had shorted out, so now I have one working earbud which will have to do until I can buy a new pair
Disappointed that they broke, but they sounded great for the 3 month that I had them
Before using, I highly recommend trying out the various sized tips to properly fit it to your ear
It comes with the medium sized tips already on, but they were too small for me
I wasn't getting any bass until I tried the next size up and that made a huge difference
Given the price, these earbuds are excellent
I was surprized how good the bass was given the tiny size of the earbuds
Again, getting a tight fit is paramount to enjoying any bass
I know mine are on tight when I feel I slight suction when taking them off
They stay in my ear quite well (once I switched to the bigger tips), and I have no issues with them slipping out when I'm exercising thanks to the non-slip silicone material
Overall a great set of earbuds given the price
I am a huge fan of music and have gone through so many earphones to the point where I was just getting tired of getting the wrong pairs
I needed some durability while still holding great sound quality and these earphones delivered
Sony is known for amazing products so I didn't hesitate to try these out, and believe me I was beyond amazed
My old earphones would only last less than a month and I wasn't in the mood to keep buying new ones, these have lasted me over 4 months and so far still great sound quality as the first day
BUY THESE if your are looking for a cheap but durable set and you will not be disappointed at all
I love these-they are very comfortable and sound pretty good
You can't beat the price
I have tried several earbud style headphones and I have to say-these are my favorite just because they are SUPER comfortable- I have actually fallen asleep with these in my ears
My ears are smaller and other brands have just been too big and not comfortable at all
I have actually ordered a few pairs to keep on hand just in case as backup
I picked up a pair of these after my sennheiser cx500 earbuds died because i wanted something now and am broke
The sennheiser quality is in my eyes unbeatable for under 100$, and these are the standard that i hold other earbuds to
However, for the 15$ i spent on these el cheapo sonys, i couldn't be happier
They sound good with hardly any burn in time
The highs are crisp without being brassy, and the low end is solid
The low end is full, bass is crisp, tight, and very responsive with a quality equalizer (i use the power amp app on my smarthphone, best 5$ app you can buy if you value your music quality)
Instruments all have good clarity and are distinguishable
The back of the buds have a semi pointy side that was starting to cause some discomfort, but changing the earbuds to the opposite ears solved this
Otherwise, from an audiophile standpoint, these buds don't really push much air
That doesn't mean they can't achieve high decibel levels
It means that it lacks the "kick" that you find in higher quality earbuds
The frequencies don't really pop out at you as a result of the clarity that comes with higher end earbuds
Some of the sennheiser's greatest qualities are the way that warm  midrange frequencies floated out of the speaker, highs were clear and warm as can be, never tinny and brassy, and the low end was rich and clear
The sony's come pretty close to this, and the difference is negligible i'm sure for most
For the price, i'd say sony hit a homerun with this product, and would absolutely recommend these to anyone who hasn't realized how much better music sounds with a sealed ear canal speaker than with those godawful iphone headphones
So the first pair of these I bought was white from Toys R Us for $12 after tax
They will last almost a year through normal use
I myself use them with my ipod nano 6th Generation that I wear as a watch for work and for use with my stereo in my truck through an auxiliary cable
They usually last for around six months for me being that I use them with my watch while I am at work building loads for the beer company I work for
I would run the wire from my watch underneath my undershirt, behind my neck to my ears, (When we were allowed to do this, not anymore)
Still with all that pulling on these they would last me for around 6 months, which was better than I expected
I have always used sony headphones (the cheap ones, first then these)
I have discovered for the price these are a very good deal, and I have to say that I am not the kind of person that treats things very delicately
The pair that I am currently using have been with me for a year, and keep in mind on average that means attaching and unattaching about 5 times a day on average
Overall well worth the money, and great sound
I absolutely love these
The sound is great
It cancels out any outside distractions for people who like that function
I'm impressed with the Bass and it's clarity
The removable rubber ear buds are great for those who are worried about the sanitation of using in-ear buds
And there are color options for fashion as well as size differences so it fits so as not to fall out or feel discomfort
I really recommend these to people who want to experience a full high-quality sound for a low price
I love these headphones
But these are my 3rd pair :( The bass is very crisp and clear and excellent noise cancellation
But you have to be very gentle with them
I really needed a temp earbuds since my main ones just broke
I bought these for �9 at Selfridge, and was totally disappointed the moment I put them on
The standard Apple earphones are 5 times better than these
Pros:1
They fit nicelyCons:1
You can hear it when the chord rubs up on your clothing2
All the songs will sound hiss-ie, the bass is super low3
The ones I got didn't work right away, I have to fiddle with the end of the chords since the sounds kept getting cut off on one side
If you must have one temporarily then buy it, but you will most likely throw these out
If you don't care about sound quality then these will be fine
I would highly recommend you spend a little more and buy something a little better
The vibrations and noise I hear when it rubs up on my clothes is annoying as hell
The Sony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones are surprisingly good
I just received a set as a Christmas "stocking stuffer;" what a treat
The headphones came with three different sizes of hybrid silicone rubber earbuds (S, M, L)
The earbuds are very comfortable, and block almost all outside noise while you're using them
This could be a little dangerous, though, since if you're the type of person who listens to music while walking to work or something, pay close attention to your surroundings because you certainly might not hear honking horns or screeching tires
Again, I received this product as a gift, and I'm thoroughly pleased with them
I'm glad I bought these ear buds
They have worked well so far and I would recommend them to a friend
Disappointing purchase
'Was' exited  to plug in the Sony MDREX10LP/BLK* to my MP3, but immediately knew they were NOT nearly as good as my MDR-EX35*The sound was much thinner, alarmingly thin sound with almost no bass
You would think the newer version of the Sony MDRs' would be better,
they are not
Really blame myself for assuming{{*exact same EQ settings for both headphonesAdd: The Sony MDR-EX35 headphones have gotten some bad reviews because the cord was pulling on the earpiece causing issues
>>>> The day I got mine, I carefully put a tiny drop of 'thick' Superglue where the cord goes into the earpiece
It's invisible and solid
I'v used my Sony MDR-EX35 headphones for over a year w/ heavy use
You just don't rip headphones out of your ear by the cord
I have owned 3 pairs of these headphones now
I am an avid music listener, and I could not find a pair of headphones with decent quality, comfort and a cheap price tag
These are about 9 bucks at Best Buy if you go when they're on sale
After living with the headphones that came with my iPod for about 2 years, these were quite the upgrade
Sure, they aren't Dr
Dre in-ear headphones, but for 9 bucks, these are awesome headphones
They deliver a great range of sound
The treble is clear and it has a pretty rich bass in my opinion
I've owned many normal headphones and they always left me with an ear-ache and poor sound quality
These come with sizes that fit anybody
The size that is on the headphones when you purchase them is too big for my comfort and they are SO easy to change out
However, the reason why I did not give them a full 5 stars is because their durability is horrid
I use them everyday, in and out of my bag and those only lasted me about 3 1/2 months
The wires are very thin and weak, and I think that with all of the wear and tear, the wires just tear up inside because in that time, one of my earbuds was totally dead
I wish Sony would give their wires about another inch of thickness
I would buy a lifetime supply of these
Overall, awesome headphones with a short lifespan
But for 9 bucks, I think it's okay for how much I use mine
Well they cost less than 15 bucks so don' be expecting Beats Audio quality ok
I use them for the gym, and for jogging, they fit perfectly in my earsnever falls, really comfortableI'm not an audiophile, but i can tell the bass is not that strong, but is theregood for isolating a little bit of noise, when you put them in max volumen you won't hear a thingother than your musicthere's no voltage noiseGood for pop rock and some electro
I usually have no problem with these kinds of cheap 10-20 buck earbuds
I've used mostly Sony MDRE828LP and Sennheiser MX400/MX500 and I've never had an issue with any of them
After my Sonys died recently, I decided to go with these in-ear buds for something new
Unfortunately I wish I had just gotten another pair of the old Sony MDRE828LP
I am very big on treble and these were sorely lacking in that regard
The sound from the MDREX10LPs was so hollow and had absolutely no life to it
It sounded like the garbage disposable headphones that they give you on airplanes
Luckily I also found a nice deal for a 2 pack of MX400s at the same time so I bought those as well and switched them out one after the other and the difference was incredible
Even my broken MDRE828LP with a dead right earbud sounded nicer
These look nice but the sound quality is horrendous
Look elsewhere
edit: I did also try all 3 sizes of the included earbud inserts but they are all varying degrees of bad
I bought these on a whim in a big box store because my old Sony ear buds finally gave up the ghost
These have turned out to be even better, with crisp clear sound and, best of all, they stay in my ear
Not sure what's different about the inserts, but these are more comfortable and stay put
I can sleep on my side them in as well
Best $15 I've spent on audio gear in years
Because I used them in bed listening to my iPod, I wish the cord was a bit longer
Still, with the comfort and sound quality these give, I can live with this minor fault
I got these buds June 17th, 2011 from my local Best Buy at $15
Something I immediately noticed was that the silicone earbuds sound muffled if you don't use the right size
Sounds obvious, but I have tiny ears and had to use some extra small ones from a different pair (the included sizes are S, M, L)
The packaging says, "produce[s] high-resolution treble & midrange with powerful bass," and doesn't disappoint
Though not sound-isolating (standing next to me, my sister could still hear my music), they provide very nice outside noise cancellation (again, be sure the silicone is the right size
)
Things to note:I've had these buds for almost two months
I've used them every day and they're holding up fine--no problems with wires separating, etc
I'm writing this review prior to going on vacation, and will update once I get back, whether or not they are still doing well
I haven't had noise-cancelling earbuds before, so I haven't any points of reference save for other reviews and the packaging
However, I do believe these are very good with noise cancellation
These are inexpensive buds
Dedicated audiophiles will probably want to hold out for some noise-isolating headphones
You might have to buy more interchangeable silicone buds if you have rather large or small ears
This model hasn't gotten many reviews online yet because it's fairly new--dated April 2011
Overall, perfect buds for my needs
I use them every day and pay attention to sound quality, though I don't want to spend $30+ on buds or other accessories for good sound
Hope this has been helpful
I'll answer the comments/questions as best I can
The only thing that would make these better might be if they included an Apple style volume control/mike on the cord
But that would increase the price
I use these to listen in bed, and they're very good at cutting outside noise because of the neoprene tips (you get three pair of different sizes with each set of earbuds, so you can pick the right size for you
)  Unless you want to pay a lot for high -end buds, these are well worth it
Product arrived in excellent condition
However, the sound isn't as good
I guess you get what you paid for
If you guys want a cheap headphone to use whenever, these are the ones for ya
I just threw this away because only one of the head phone worked wasted my money its ok better luck next time
you get what you pay for
So, the Head phones came in a nice pack way before expected delivery, so thumbs up to the seller
Its actually quite a deal if you go to see that you get some Sony head phones for this cheap
Now these headphones are designed for everyday use and I bought them for it
I have other head phones for the quality sound entertainment
But for everyday use you prolly wouldn't use you 40$ headphones and so for me these headphones, Sony MDREX10lp/BLK are perfect
Like i said not bad for a couple of dollars
The're relatively cheap and work well
The extra ear pads are nice to have for ear compfort
Don't need anything more elaborate
These headphones are just excellent I had the monster turbines before these and these are right below them it's just missing a little bit of bass but otherwise they're worth the bang for your buck
Just as the picture
The product was in a perfect state and arrive at time
I'm very happy with this purchase
I use a pair of these every 6 months or so
I am very abusive to my earbuds and have given up on the really costly ones
The price is right for 6 months tunes in bed and when they die (usually one ear goes dead) I just pick up another pair
I got these to use at work, cord is too short to reach the computer speakers behind my monitor, not nearly as much bass as other reviewers had indicated
I bought these for my dad for Christmas so he can use them with his bluetooth cell phone device he uses on his motorcycle
Usually you get what you pay for but these work well above their pricing level-- very satisfiedquality for the dollar - JLAB makes a stylish, quality and cost effective product,
Not bad, but I suggest the J3 with the tangle-resistant cords
Had for right around a year before it got a short
At the time were best I had very comfortable and quality sound
I just got the Sony extra bass for 40$ and it is a improvement but for double the price you might just want these
The sound quality is excellent but they slip out of my ears regardless of which size buds I use
Not a total deal breaker but I wouldn't buy this style again
Shipping was fast
Son loves them
He uses them all the time and sound is crystal clear
I've purchased 4 sets of these earbuds, mainly for use while riding the bus
The noise-cancelling capability was fantastic, in that I was able to listen to (mainly) podcasts at a reasonable level, the sound was clear, and functioned as well as some earbuds I had paid > $99 for
The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is that the cord, while a nice thickness, tends to "grab" anything you walk near (door knobs, chair arms, etc), due to the way the cord retains its loop shape when fully unwound
Depending on how careful I am in tucking the cord under a coat or somewhere safe, I've been able to keep them functional up to over a year
This last pair lasted about a month before one ear stopped working  :(
I still think these are a great deal at $19, but if this next pair doesn't last longer than a month, I'll have to move on
Stopped working after second day of using them
Now I understand why they went from so expensive to cheap
I was worried about that when I saw the image of the tip
It's a waste of money don't touch it
I prefer something small in my ear that allows me to sleep on my side and not have something bulky that makes it uncomfortable to put my head on a pillow
I like that the plug is curved so that it does not get caught on things and in the way as much as a straight plug
These seem to work ok, but I bought them to use with my Kindle HD Fire, and I can only hear sound out of one ear--that could be because there is only 1 speaker in the Kindle--I don't know
But They work pretty well
While I wasn't expecting outstanding earphones for the price
I was definitely expecting much better than what I got
The quality on these earphones is horrific
The sound is even worse
The stuff you buy at the dollar store sound better
Do yourself a favor and skip on this deal
One of the earbuds did not work when we opened the package
I have a replacement in route and UPS on the way to pick up the defective ones
Hopefully the new ones will be  fine
So far the experience has been fine (ease of return, no extra expense to me)
If they work and last more than a month this will get 5 stars
I like the sound quality
(i bought 2 other colors and they are working fine) and they are comfortable
I'm not a big "music" person
I mostly listen to audio books, so I can't give you all the technical ins and outs
I will say I can definitely tell a difference in sound quality though and it's positive ;)
Hoping they last
That's the biggest thing
My experience with ear buds have not been great as far as how long they last
Excellent sound, clarity, and no outside noises
They come with extra ear pieces to fit your ear too
I would reccommend these to anybody who wants great sound
They're much better than the ear buds that come with Apple devices
These earbuds were okay for the first few months but then, just like my previous JBuds, they stop working on one side
Also, the overall quality becomes a hit or miss
Sometimes, I get the full surround sound and other times its as if I'm listening to mono radio
I'm not happy with these ear-buds and DO NOT recommend these
I bought these JLab J5M earbuds because they were 80% off
I was using skullcandy earbuds prior to this and had to replace them
The second I plugged these J5Ms in I regretted my purchase
There is almost no bass response
These were originally priced at $65 which is absurd
I would expect earbuds that were that expensive to at least have a moderate low to mid level response
The high end is "tinny" also
I will be returning these
The reason I am giving these a 2 star is only due to the comfort of the fit and seal they produce
Perfect product
I own 3 different JLab Earbuds and love them all
I've owned the J5 for 7 months and they are still working great
Once you find out which size tip works for your ear, they are super comfortable
Also the different size tips affect how the music sounds so experiment until you find what you like
I leave them in pretty much all day while at work and my ears don't hurt at all
I stumbled upon their products when my old headphones gave out ($20 sony earbuds) and I noticed the JLab earphones were around the same price
The difference was night and day
I am now an avid JLab fan, and I will not hesitate to purchase more if I ever break my current earbuds or when I can afford some of JLabs more expensive models
I recommend JLab products to everyone I know
Excellent sound quality / build quality / customer service
So far so great
Great sound and durable
Will update if problems occur
Flimsy finish
Awesome ear buds
third pair just to have because they were on sale and couldnt pas up
Great sound and great quality
Most reliable headphones I found so far
Other models usually  disintegrate within a month or two after carrying in a pocket , those last for 6 months and more of pretty brutal use
I can't complain about the sound quality as well
Allows you to have phone conversations in noisy environment, where otherwise you would not be able to hear anything(just cover the mic or put on mute when you are not talking)
Do not hurt you ears like the original apple headphones do
Out of the box only one earbud worked
Returned it with no issues
In the past I purchased the J3s but tried these as the J3s were out of stock
The problem is that this is also an issue with the J3s
Typically takes about 6-8 months but they always stop working on one side
The sound is great and the design is perfect for small ears
I wish they would fix this defect on all JLabs earbuds because they do have a good product and this should be an easy defect to fix
I purchased these on sale, paid about $22 dollars
I don't use them too much and after 1 month i can't hear anything on the right side
I can't make a return because I bought them over a month ago
Lesson learned, don't buy these
Great sound and very light
These are really uncomfortable
Also the "control" doesn't actually control the iphone
It seems like it is just for show
These earbuds do the job but not as well as my OLD Sony earbuds
One positive thing about them though is the fact I can actually hear the music in my right ear
I am almost deaf in that ear so I was very surprised when I discovered I could hear using these earbuds
I recommend them for anyone who just wants to be in the middle road
Amazing sound range
slightly prone to tangling, and headphones are prone to outside physical noises
Great sound, but the earbuds tend to fall out
super quality and sound
shame that the product arrived I defetuoso
as the buy for my partner's birthday and when I get to use only 1 of the headphones sounds
bad luck
since I have purchased products from this brand before and they were all excellent
The sound was better than I expected
Great bass response
But, like every other ear bud I've bought, one side has stopped working
Sound is ver y good
Great headphones, especially for the price
I thought the treble was pretty clear but I was most impressed with the depth of the base for earbuds
Work well and are comfortable in my ears
nice and clear
One ear stop working
We have had these replaced at least 4 times, I lost count
The good thing is they would always replace them if they're still under the 1-year warranty, but the bad thing is you have to keep getting them replaced and each time you have to pay shipping to ship them back
I've already spent more than double on shipping alone compared to the price I paid for these
They are not worth it unless you want to pay a lot to keep replacing them after a few weeks or a few months of use
Great sound in ear, good microphone reception
Only problem with them is that due to their design, they block out sound from outside, which may hinder your ability to drive with them
Bought 2 but 1 broke within 2 weeks
Very good
Value for money
The worst headphone I ever purchased
Very clear fits snugly excellent quality
I always look for and buy the $14 JBuds since I go through 1-2 pair a year due to a rugged lifestyle
The sound is good, and gotta love the price
I was worried when I opened the package to find these in a static bag and not a box
But after opening it, I discovered  many small details (like the Y split with a molded "J5" logo instead of a sticker, or the fine holes in the screen mesh) showing care and attention to build quality
Of course, these don't mean anything if the headphones don't sound good
and they don't
They sound great
I was amazed with the first listening: clean, crisp highs, and booming bass -- and from such tiny hardware
The heavy low end might turn off purists, but it's just what I'm looking for in earbuds
Well designed and well manufactured, the J5s are a steal for the price
[UPDATE] About 2 weeks after I bought these, the little "J5" logo fell out, from where it sits at the Y splitter
It looks like that is glued in, and I could've fixed it myself had I noticed it at the time
I emailed JLabs and explained the problem, and they told me to just send them back and they'd send me a coupon to buy anything of the same value from their website
So customer service is excellent, too
Broke after three weeks, one of the earbuds separated from the housing and a wire broke off, so it only plays in one ear now
It worked well and sounded good, but it seems to be made rather cheaply
This was with normal use sitting at a desk, not any type of misuse
I won't buy again
One of the ears went out after a few months
This is not a quality product
Do not buy
it was great when it lasted
One earbud stopped working after 2 weeks of purchase
They fit great but they are just okay sounding
For the price I'll keep them to use during workouts
These J5's  did not have the mic
Sound is great, but my other J5's had the mic
Great sound, great bass, even better price
You get what you pay for
No external volume control
I did not know what to expect due to the price and I don't know the JlLab brand
The work great and the are well made, fit well in the ear and product a comfortable clear sound
I have enjoyed the earbuds very much and recommend them it terms of price and quality
They're pretty good headphones, nearly on par with the J4 headphones
The 45 degree angle jack is certainly better than the straight jack on the J4s
However, my pair of J5s have a defect on the jack where the plastic meets the metal that causes the left headphone to short out occasionally
My left headphone shorting out on the J4s is why I bought this pair of J5s, so it's pretty disappointing that these headphones aren't better
They were pretty cheap at 12 dollars, though, so I'm not terribly upset
I would suggest the J4s over the J5s, however, if you're looking for sturdy headphones without defects that will last you over a year
I was pretty hard on my J5s and they survived for a year and a half
I've only had the J5s for a month and a half, but the J4s seem to have better sound quality and to be sturdier than the J5s
Good sound and quality product for low price
So far these have been very good
I gave them four stars because I have not had them very long
I'll have to see how they last
The sound quality is very good for inexpensive buds
Also I like how lightwait they are
You can bearly notice them
No real complants so far
Great for mobile devices (tablets, personal computers)
Fantastic sound quality too for the price
Work well, good sound
Great for audio books
Amazing sound and endurance totally worth the buy
I decided to purchase these based on specs
And I wasn't disappointed
I know what my ears like and these fit and fill my ears well, happy listening
As a bit of a preface to my headphone history: I try my best take care of my headphones, but haven’t had good experience in the past with earbuds
The 3
5 mm connector always seems to break on me, so I’ve gone through two pairs of J2s, and then went to Sony for a year or so, and have since decided to come back to Jbuds for their great quality and price
I have now had the J5s for the past 2 months, and they are holding up well
The 45 degree connector has worked well for me, and hopefully will help stop my streak of going through earbuds in 6 months or less
It seems quite robust, and I have had no problems with it whatsoever
Now, for the sound quality: I wouldn’t qualify myself as an audiophile, and don’t know that much about sound, but all my music is in Apple Lossless, and it sounds amazing on these
They do a great job at getting rid of outside noise, and I use them to work out 5 days a week, and have gone on several flights with them
I can barely hear anything but the music when I put it at about 50% loudness on my iPhone
Finally, the bass is quite surprising in these tiny earbuds
The comfort with these is also a major plus
I have just kept the original cushion on the earbuds, which I believe is the medium size
It works great for me, and I can wear these for hours without it being painful
Furthermore, I have fallen asleep many times with these in, and my ears don’t hurt when I wake up (something that Ive had trouble with in the past)
The only downside that Ive experienced with these is the cord noise
Sometimes, when it hits my desk or computer or something else, it will produce some kind of static or other noise
I see this as a minimal drawback, and haven’t experienced it to the extent that some other reviewers have
So, in conclusion, these are amazing earbuds for the price
They are quality earbuds that I think can go head to head with many earbuds that are more expensive
Lastly, they sound great, and thats what headphones are supposed to do, right
goodones
Jlab makes the best ear buds around for their cost
I love the ergonomic design of these headphones and the sound quality is excellent
These are my third pair of jbuds (all still work) and I have yet to be disappointed
These things sound great and are super comfortable
These are quite the durable ear buds
My daughter loves to twirl, whip, chew, stretch, and other various destructive habits, with her ear buds
I have found the JLab J5M to be extremely durable and a value
Now
When they say they are kevlar reinforced, I believe it to be true
They must be to withstand the abuse I see them undergo each day
and they keep working
She is rather picky about the sound of her ear buds too
I bought her 13 different pair for Christmas because she typically goes through them so fast
Her last set of J5M's lasted until July
So a little over 7 months
Now you may say, "That's garbage
They should last longer than that
" But when I tell you she is abusive, I really mean it
She uses them as a chew toy constantly
Every time I look at her, I have to tell her to quit doing 'something' to her ear buds
Normally, a pair will last her, if we're lucky, a week
So for a pair to last as long as these have, I am impressed
I have not used them, and I am extremely picky with my sound because I used to be a sound engineer
But she is also pretty picky, and for her to say they're good, they must not be bad
Because if they are missing anything, she tells me, and won't use them
These particular ear buds are a good value for the dollar, and are durable
I do recommend them
Love it
These ear buds were pretty good
They didn't fit into my ear very well but that's only because I didn't change the ear bud tips
Other than that, they have very good sound and nice noise isolation
Were great while they lasted
Stopped working completely two months and four days after purchase
The right side went first, and then the left
Won't be buying another pair of these
These buds break the rule that you get what you pay for
These buds were only like $22
00, (which as buds go is cheap) but the sound is amazing
You would have a hard time knowing which was this brand or wshich was Bose
Buy them NOW> and get some as gifts
great sound quality and base
i have accidentally washed it in with my pants several times and it still works like a dream
worth every penny
I bought these because of great reviews
After trying them, I think it all depends on how well they fit in your ears
If you get a nice comfortable, tight seal -- apparently they're amazing
But none of the sizes provided fits perfectly in my ears
They are either too big and uncomfortable to wear, or too small and prone to falling out or generating noise as I move
(I tried all the sizes
) Still, they're fine, I just wouldn't pay top dollar for them
They seem to go on sale frequently
Yes, these are very good quality
Made the earphone that came with my phone, seem like junk
I bought two pair and We love them
I have been using JLab Earbuds for a few years
Great headphones, the price is right too, less than 10 bucks
The Warranty, if you need it, is painless
I would recommend without hesitation
Terrible earbuds
Had to return both ones I bought for the same reason
One side only works after 1 use
Amazing crystal clear sound
works great
I ordered these a month ago for an international trip
I loved them right away
Color, fit, angle of the plug were all great
The sad thing is that the left ear is already going out
Truly disappointed in them
I expected a much better quality, and for them to last much much longer
Great sounding ear buds
As other people have stated, when running etc you can hear the cord making noise as it bounces against your chest etc, but this didn't bother me too much
Still one of the best pair of ear-buds I have purchased for a great price
works for inexpensive application
They are just alright , the dollar store earbuds work just as well but don't have all the extra foam attachments
Really not worth the price in my opinion
I use them daily - great
Great earbuds, great sound, not expensive
I used for less than 30 days when one side went out
Seemed solid at the time
Second pair
Lost the first pair
The changeable ear pieces are very nice and fit snug in ear
Low end response is some of the best I have experienced in ear buds
Have used these now for over two years
if you count the first pair
Would purchase again
I ordered a set of these along with a pair of Panasonic RPHJE120K buds as a backup
The sound quality of the pair I recieved was good, but the balance was off a bit towards the left, which generally indicates a volume problem with the right phone
After about ten days of use, the right bud would occasionally stop producing anything other than minimal sound, an intermittent problem that occurred on rare occasion at first, but became more prominent as time went on
I would rate this initial pair as unacceptable due to these problems
On the positive side, however, registration of the set on the JLabs site was quick and easy, and filing a warranty claim was likewise a simple, streamlined affair, taking no more than about 10 minutes
Within an hour, I received an email saying a new set of buds was on the way, and got the replacements right away
I've been using the replacement buds for about a week now
Right away the sound was much better, without the balance problem of the previous pair
Sound quality is good for a set of $20 buds, with solid bass, clear mids, and good range highs
These also produce better volume than the Panasonics I got at the same time, with better quality sound overall
They're comparable to the V-Moda bass relief buds that used to be my mainstay phones, but provide a better balance, without the bass-heavy sound
The fit with the large tips is snug and comfortable, even for longer listening sessions
Overall, I've been very pleased with the replacement pair
I'm hoping they prove to be more durable than the initial set
The sound quality for the price can't be beat, so long as you get a good pair
Look very much like a very high quality and high technology piece of equipment, just like its name sounds
The body is nicely milled out of aluminum alloy and cover with powder spray paint,  the connector jack is nicely angled, and the cord is built with nice rubbery material that seems will never tangle up
It is really nice to look at and feel in your hand
I don't know if it is just louder or really better then the cheaper ones
Anyway, after a run with this earphone, it  seems a little heavy, I can feel the cord bouncing on my body and making lots of noise in my ears
Every slight unintentionally tug on the cord the earphone will come out of your ea unless you push the earbud into your ear very hard, but then you would feel like you are taking off or landing in an airplane
Also, they are sticking out of your ear a little too far with bouncing wires flapping along with every steps you take
So I will never run with it again or use it again not mentioning buying anything like that again
I really like the cheaper one I am using that made of plastic with a light, narrow soft plastic cord that I can't even feel it is around
The earpiece are hanging on you ears and the earbud is on the earpiece which is comfortably rest in your ear holes instead of the whole shebang hanging on your ear holes
And they don't sound any different just setting it one click louder
I used these ear buds twice before the left one went out
Now the sound out of the right ear bud is muffled
Would not purchase again
Love these ear buds
Very comfortable & great sound
Not that durable but the return policy is excellent
Good sound for a fairly cheap price
Best travel earbuds with great noise cancelling function
I have had these headphones for less than three months and it has gone mono instead of stereo
I thought they would be great and they worked great for a while then just stopped
love it, so durable
I use it everyday during my commute to/from work
Very comfortable
Good quality of sound
The second one I purchased (lost the first one)
Nice
junk
Terrific product
Love them
Work wonderfully, sound great, and the metal buds are extremely durable
Microphone picks up sound excellently
If you're looking for inexpensive but decent headphones these are great BUT JLab has a nasty history of earbuds not working after a short while
I would recommend the J6M earbuds over these but either one is a decent pick
It would be 3 stars but the company's return policy is extremely decent and they also have options to recycle the broken headphones as well
Good quality and good sound
I would recommend to anyone looking for inexpensive ear buds
Great sound, a little less bass than previous, and the most annoying thing is that I always lose the little blue coverings, even though JLAB sends extra pairs, it still manages to get lost
I love the sound because they are kind of like noise canceling headphones
When you plug them in, even if you are in a subway or a busy place, you can hear the music perfectly without having to make the volume too loud
I would recommend these headphones because they do not get tangled as much as others since the actual buds are magnetic
The tone is beautiful
But, they look fragile and the wires tangle
But I enjoy using them
My wife likes her headphones, being used on her cell phone (Nexus 4) and iPod - but these are for general use
One star knocked off for the durability of these headphones from JLab - I've gone through quite a few where one side would just stop working
I've claimed a few through the warranty process, but sometimes it's just easier to buy another pair
Again, good sound for day-to-day use
Work great
These are AWESOME
The stereo sound on these is great; I use them while I'm playing games on my Kindle because these don't have the volume control on the cord
These headphones were recommended to me by a friend who has a similar problem to mine: tiny ear canals
These earbuds come with three different sizes, and the smallest are perfect for me
I can wear the headphones for extended periods of time without any discomfort, which is usually not the case
I use these when I work out, which means I want them to stay in place and allow for me to hear ambient noises as well
These definitely do the job
These also work well with hands-free phone operation - I've never had any complaints from anyone with whom I have spoken w/r/t sound quality
My only complaint is that there is a weak spot where the metal plug connects to the rubber cord
My phone slipped out of my pocket during one workout during bench presses and the cord broke where it meets the metal plug
No amount of super gluing fixed the situation and now I'm stuck with a precariously connected plug that may or may not twist to failure in successive workouts
The sound is not very good, sounds a bit metallic and lacks depth, but this is not the worst part
The earphone (I've tried all 3 pairs that come with it) don't fit well and so that creates an even less desirable sound reproduction since you can hear outside noise very easily
Lastly, the 1/8 plug seems to be every so slightly different/larger than most headphones and it causes these to easily unplug from the device
I've tried them in my Samsung S5 as well as my wife's Samsung Note 3
Wouldn't buy these again, I'd rather use the OEM headphones if only I hadn't lost them
I use these even when I don't have to because the sound is amazing
At first I got sound in only one ear, but the help I got from other customers quickly resolved the problem
I did not have the buds plugged in far enough
Nice, comfortable earbuds
These headphones broke in under a week
Sounds muffled
I have bought 3 pairs of these headphones and all three have had one of the earpieces stop working within a week of purchase
My main complaints are:Headphones are rated at 4 stars but were 5 stars at first purchaseOriginal price was $8
99 then rose to $12
99 now they are $19
99I've noticed a trend in Amazon Prime eligible items that start off cheap with a near perfect score of 4
5 - 5 stars
Trusting in the customer ratings, I make the purchase only to be disappointed with the product
Examples below
Blender - Doesn't mix properly, won't crush ice, not very good
Had 5 star rating when purchased with over 1K reviews
Now it's at 3 stars
Hair curling wand - Broke within a month of purchase
Had 5 star rating with over 2k reviews, now 3 stars
I really want to be able to trust the user reviews of products and I like buying Amazon Prime eligible items
I've been burned so many times now that I'm hesitant to buy anything from Amazon that has Prime eligibility
The products are inferior or damaged or break shortly after purchase
Great earphones, sound quality is awesome, and they do work with my s5 :D
Completely unusable
I cannot judge the quality of the audio reproduction because any slight movement of the wires translate into thunder overpowering whatever is playing
I gave all 6 variations of rubber earpiece a try, and even placed them in my ears without the cups in case it was the material
It's not, i suspect it is the metal construction that seems so sturdy
The plastic on the wire is stiff, and the robust connection to the housing allows vibrations to resonate along the entire package
It sounds like a fisher price stethoscope
It seemed like there was a nice base response, but I couldn't really tell over the sound the texture of my shirt was making as i turned my head slightly to look at the packaging and determine if it was worth returning or if i should do the world a favor and destroy them so that they may never afflict another eardrum
I took very good care of it (along with another earphone from JLab) -- both earphones broke within a month
With this earphone in particular, I cannot hear with the left side of the earphone anymore -- and it's been less than a month
These are good headphones, but when there is static in the environment these can be worse than other earbuds because they will literally zap you in your ear if you make contact with someone or something with too much static
sturdy, lasting a a while now
One of the earbuds died after 3 weeks
Not worth it
These are Great Ear Buds,  Don't be fooled by cheap ear buds you get what you pay for,  these should get 6 stars I would recommend them to all my friends
I bought these as a gift for my dad for Father's Day this year and unfortunately they quit working after only one use
The sound went out in both the earbud pieces and wouldn't come back
Great sounding
I'd buy another pair
every nice for the money
It Arrived when expected and with excellent conditions, the best earbuds that you can buy for the price, guaranteed
Great sound at a great price
I have very small ear canals and struggle to find good fitting, decent sounding earbuds
I discovered the J3 Jbuds several years ago and love them (5 star review)
I bought my daughter a pair of J3s a year ago
Just recently, I tore the smallest tips and the next size up proved to be uncomfortable
I came to Amazon to buy replacement tips only to find J5s for a cheaper price
no brainer, right
Upgrade to more recent technology, right
WRONG
In plain English, the J5s suck
I found the sound to be very tinny, any adjustments to my streaming programs with no improvement in the output
It was like the treble was on high with no ability to lower it
I will disclose I am more of a bass person than treble but appreciate a good balance
There's no balance in these ear buds
I purchased a pair of JLab J5 ear buds and the left ear bud quit working in less than two months
Very disappointing
But thankfully Amazon replaced them free after I wrote to them about my experience
Not sure if it was because I'm a Prime member or what
It sure made my day
I hope my next pair will fair better cause I really liked them
They were small enough to not hurt my ears when wearing them for long periods
i use these every day when i run
I sweat alot and they dont short out on me
Very lightweight and fit into my ears well, no slipping out
Good sound quality
Excellent product
Excellent service
The sound was what you would expect from a $10 pair of headphones
Muddy, but I'm okay with that
Don't expect these to last too long either because the build quality is right at or just below what you pay for
The cords are very skinny
I ordered the "Sneakerhead" color (black/grey/red) and the cord turned out to be more of a bright pink then red
Then after 2 days one of the earphones stopped working
T hese earphones didn't last 3 weeks, I bought these earbuds because I have always been a fan of Jlab
However, though all that I have bought of this brand in the past have performed very well, this particular pair gave out in less than a month
There seems to be a short in one of the earbud housings
We all make mistakes, but this one disappointed me
I liked these OK at first - the sound is good, not great but good enough
Then they started producing small shocks in my ears every once in a while
It was really unpleasant
I wasn't at all disappointed when I lost them
I don't recommend buying this product
the tonal quality is great
they have a wide frequency range, and they have small price tag on them
The end
They are OK at best
You can be something comparable at Wal-Mart, or Tiger Direct for half of the price
Kids love them
Good quality
Hold up well
Quick shipping
Super loud hadphones
love it i used them in my job and i work demolition so the place is very loud and this headphones help me
thanks
Got these cheap for 10 bucks and free shipping
Easily would pay 40-50 for them
Good quality, comfortable
Strongly recommended
I swear when I bought these exact headphones ~2 years ago when they were more expensive, the sound quality was pretty impressive
Now at $10, these sound like every other $10 earbuds on the market
Oh well, maybe I'm just imagining things
What could either frustrate you to no end, or be very, very pleasant is the fact that these actually go inside your ear and sort-of seal off outside noises
This gives that sort of 'stethoscope' effect where you can hear the cords every time they're being touched, but it's great for blocking out noises when you're playing music
I used these on a long 8 hour flight situated behind two perpetually crying defecating infants, and these headphones were the only things keeping me sane
If you are just looking for a cheap ($9) pair of headphones, they are OK
As mentioned on other reviews, there is a lot of noise if you are running or jostling the wires very much
If you just want something for sitting at your desk and listening to tunes while doing your work, these are perfect
For the gym, jogging or exercise not so much
I gave a three star because I bought two pair and the other pair works fine but this one didn't last
They came with several bud caps, fit nicely in the ear and produced good sound
Mysteriously one earbud just stopped working
Didn't return it because they're cheap enough that it's not worth the effort
Great sound for great price
This is my second set of Jlab's (other set Diego's) love both pairs and they sound great
ive only had them about 2 weeks but so far they seem good
the sound is amazing
i like the multiple buds that come with it to custom fit your ear
I purchased (2) pair of these earbuds, always good to have a backup
And this past week, one ear had the sound go out
WHAAAAAAAAAAAT, as I use these for walking at lunchtime as well as at the gym and now, after 6 weeks, im forced to use the other set (NOT GOOD)
The sound quality in these earphones have some sort of "metal" scratching feel to them, when using and I DETEST that you cannot stop/pause without actually using the phone (most earbuds have a device on the cord that allows you to pause that way)
The sound is pretty good but im just disappointed at the longevity (or a lack thereof) of these earphones
You can best believe that you wont find me ordering another pair of THESE
But I will use the other set, starting tomorrow, to be sure that the current set isn't "defective", a fluke
but the "Metal" in the name sure holds true although I don't know WHY one would need to hear a metal sound within earphones
Makes no sense to me (shrugging)
These headphones are great for listening to music with bass
They are worth it and the quality is good as well
These blow away my Bose ears buds
The music sounds professional quality
You hear instruments you don't hear with even expensive earphones
Makes me sick I paid $100 for the Bose
And the Bose wires came apart where they attach to the earpiece and can't be fixed, The JLab use Kevlar wires and I doubt they will fail
Pro: Good sound and good priceCon: Large kinda awkward plug  Mic/Button setup is too large  Button is hard to useBottom line: Good sound but the design needs some work
I think that the mic/button bothers me the most
The microphone is a little large than I'd like and the button is hard to find without actually looking at it
I use these daily on the bus/subway and it's always a pain trying to find the button without actually looking down at it
Since the button is smooth and with the rest of the mic i's really hard to locate with touch alone
I've also found that trying to skip tracks is a real pain
I usually try a few times to skip a track before it works but most of the time I just give up
I love the sound from these
Good bass, good highs
The cord doesn't curl up and tangle, so that is a big plus
These are awesome headphones
I bought four sets and I would put them in the same class of the Monster headphones
I would definitely recommend these to anyone
Product broke in less than a month
I usually play it for my 20 minute commute at 70% volume
My Samsung Galaxy SIII earphones last better and still works after a year
Anything that touches the cord reverberates loudly back to the earbud
This makes for an awful and distracting listening experience
Broke in less than 30 days I guess you get what you pay for
Lost sound in one side
No bueno
Serviceable quality,compared to professional headphones
Reviews were so sparkling, I thought I'd take a chance at $9
99, plus $5
73 shipping
and very glad I didn't pay full price
They're not horrible, but they're not close to what I normally use, Sony's MDR-7506 cans
Very boomy, not crisp, but useful for voice editing
Great sound for all of the 72 minutes they worked
Just quit - dead
Zilch
Cheap price - expensive item for 72 minutes of use
These buds are very comfortable and the fit for me is perfect
Sound is clear, very happy with my purchase
Sure they look a bit flimsy compared to others in the JLab line -- and I have a whole lot of them that I've accumulated over time (still have them, in fact, because I've found them incredibly durable) -- but these sound nearly as good as any of them; the Epic included
NEARLY doesn't mean AS, of course, but good enough for me not to complain given the price
Comfort is also just as good as any of the JLabs that I have (J4, J6, Epic)
What these inexpensive ones *don't* have (beyond a high price tag) is an assortment of additional tips or a carrying case (at least, mine didn't)
That's not a problem in my case since the tips included fit my ears well and I have other cases but you might feel differently
Just got these so I don't know how they'll hold up but, sound and comfort-wise, they are great
Would like to hgood buyear a little ore bass,but enjoy the features
It works just as advertised
A real  good  biy
These earbuds are very nice
Great sound and fits very nicely
I got two (a blue and a metal)
The blue is really nice, but I am not too crazy about the metal color
It is lighter than I expected, but again the sounds is great
I have had several sets of JLab JBuds over the years in differing price ranges and styles
They serve the purpose well for the price  range
Good product
One side of earbuds is defected
It has lower volume than the other one and sometime it gives off static noise
These earbuds are pretty good
The sound is good - very clear
So far so good, I have not had any problems with them
I use them everyday - they are worth the price
Much better then some other brands that I have tried
Update 7-18-14I love the earbuds but they are defective and just stopped working completely - what a disappointment because they sound good for the price
Amazon was nice enought to replace them for me
I hope these last longer then the last pair
Very nice headphones for the price - great sound - maybe a little bass heavy but I was looking for that
Nice quality to the build abd the wires
Thom
Sound is awesome - color is awesome - couldn't ask for better
They're usable if you're sitting and not moving, but any slight touch on the wire creates noise through the earbuds
The earbuds fit nicely and cancel noise well, which actually serves to emphasize the noise through the cables
I use them at my desk only, when I need to use them for a webinar or something like that and want to kill outside conversations or noise
I won't use them to listen to music, and not even to listen to an audiobook when I walk
Edit: I see the price must vary or maybe I got mine on sale
I paid $10, but the going rate seems to be $20 now just days later
That doesn't change my opinion and I would gladly pay $20 for another pair and still think that's a fair price
I've tried countless headphones in the $20-50 price range over the years and I think these are the best value and sound great
Incredible value
That sums it all up right there
This is my 2nd purchase of JLab buds, the first pair is still going strong after two years hard use
I like them so much, I wanted to have another backup pair on hand and ready to go
Other reviews have mentioned quality and units dying quickly
I'm sure that's happened, anything that's massed produced at a low price point is bound to have defective units
As mentioned above, my first pair as been thoroughly abused in all sorts of conditions (I take them where I'm afraid to lose or damage my more expensive earbuds) and they've held up beautifully and still sound like day 1
Lucky
Maybe
I have numerous earbuds ranging in price from $10 to $200 for various uses
These $10 Jbuds are probably the ones I grab the most
I would put them head-to-head with any earbuds at $50 or less and would bet the vast majority of listeners would find these just as good as the most expensive ones
They'd be shocked once they found out the price was only $10
The sound is great, excellent in fact for the price
Are they going to sound as good as something 10x the price, no, of course not
If you're reading this review, you're probably not trying to compare them to Shure's, Sennheiser's or whoever (you shouldn't be)
You're probably trying to compare them to other $10-$30 earbuds
Stop
You've found the best
If you're looking for the absolute best value for the money, you've found it
Buy now with no hesitation
If lose them, break the cord, they stop working after X months or whatever -- THEY WERE ONLY $10
You got your moneys worth
If you hate them -- THEY WERE ONLY $10
Mine didn't last very long
good luck
I expected more about this product and its not like  what I did
I thought this was going to be a good product but it wasn't
The right earbud gave out the next day
I am not exaggerating when I tell you that you have to wiggle it a certain way for it to give off sound
Do not buy this product just spend a little moreoney for better earphones
Got these for a co-worker and she loved them
5 Star product
It's an okay headphone
I found the earbuds themselves uncomfortable and switched them out with some others I have from a previous JBud (which the cat ate the cord, hence ordering new ones)
They don't reduce all noise and tend to come loose or fall out when I'm walking the dog
But I didn't want to pay a ton of money for headphones so they do the trick
I had several JLabs before this, but I am for sure the most satisfied with these J5M
They are very comfortable
very clear sound, and very good quality
I take very poor care of them and still they are indestructible
I am very happy with J5M and would highly recommend it
THESE ARE A MUST HAVE
I got these in black and purple/black for me and my hubby and they have been incredible
Love that they came with different sizes earbud pieces because my ears are smaller and I needed to be able to make that size decision
Great set of headphones for a great price, can't go wrong with these
Sound is impressive for the price and the quality feels above its price
Buds don't fit very well
If I hold them in myself, the sound is pretty good
Also, they have a short in the wire
Once fiddled with, I can get the buds to work fine
These are perfect for my teenager, who seems to go thru a couple pair of earbuds a year
These sound good and they're at a great price, so if they get lost or stepped on, I'm not out too much money
I bought these as an upgrade to my beloved Panasonic rphje120
These j5 headphones sounded great when they lasted, but that doesn't matter, because after a week of use the left ear bud stopped working
Simply ridiculous
I own many pairs of headphones, and thus I know how to treat them with care
Nothing I did warrants the incredibly short life span of this product
Horrible
Because jlabs products seem to be so popular on amazon, I did not expect something like this to happen
I'm going back to my Panasonic's as my main budget ear bud, and will  probably never be touching jlabs products again
Great jobs guys, you lost another customer
I bought a pair of J6M back in August 2013 what a great experience
, nice sound and really durable, sadly I bought J5M and my experience is really bad first they came without mic button (bad quality control) the button wasn't inside the package
, 1 day later left ear died, if you want to buy get J6, stay away from J5 series
I'm using this product since a few months now
The sound is very good and they are still working quite good
Especially the ajustable parts make sure the headphones stay in the ear (tested it while running really quickly)
Recommand this product
Sounds solid, heavy on the bass, and you need to try out each little ear piece but still better than products you would find at a local store
Not sure about the interesting  shape at the connection points
Since the connection points seem to be the spots most likely to fail, I am hoping the change will bring some durability
UNHAPPY
I HAD THE  RIGHT EARBUD IN MY EAR AND LOST SOUND
TRIED IN DIFFERENT DEVICES STILL THE RIGHT BUD DOESNT WORK
PURCHASED APRIL 16TH RECEIVED A FEW DAYS AFTER STOPPED WORKING MAY 27TH
CANT RETURN TO AMAZON BECAUSE ITS OUTSIDE OF THEIR RETURN DATE
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
OH AND JUST FYI THEY STILL LOOK BRAND NEW THERE ARE NO CUTS IN THE WIRES NOTHING IS LOSE CONNECTING TO THE EARBUD THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABUSED IN ANYWAY
Well constructed and attractive, they sound as good as they look
Highly recommended
Get you some before they're all gone
I purchased a pair of J5M ear buds and found the sound quality to be excellent
The base is far better than other ear buds I've used and the shape and size of the ear pieces make them very comfortable wearing while working out
The in-line mic is a nice feature and sound quality is great but I use it rarely
The best part of this product, however, is the product support by JLab
My first pair lost audio in the left ear after about six weeks
I found that the Amazon warranty had expired so I went to JLab site and found that they have a one year warranty
I filed a claim online, it was confirmed within 48 hrs, and I had a replacement pair within a week after that via routine mail
There were no questions asked
They stand behind their product--a rarity these days
I use these when I ride my bike
Ive been using them for over a month now
Im think of ordering more of JLab products, Ive already convince my co workers to buy some as well
my pair broke up after a month of minor usage
one earbud simply went quiet
since there are many reports of the same problem, there is something fundamentally wrong with the construction
this is not a cord problem
I waited a while to give these a raiting
I have probably purchased more than 20 Jlab Jbuds in the past 4 years
some you can take through hell and they will last you a year+, and then there are the pair that are completely pampered and stay at your desk and die in about 2 months
There is a little something off in the sound with the J5's; an echo
But so far so good
great price I bought 4 and gave them out my friends and family we all like them I recommend them to all music lovers
I bought these last year on Dec 4th 2013 and they are still going strong
i run in these all the time and they handle the abuse
Plus, i sweat so much and these headphones have stood the test of time and really surpassed my expectations
Sound quality is great too
If you're not a crazy audiophile than you will love these
The sound is nearing Monster Turbine level
I actually bought these so i didn't have to run in my Turbines but now i just use them all the time
These don't stay in my ears period
Just sitting they will eventually fall out, and they are useless for sports
The sound quality and microphone are good, but the design of the rubber tips makes them work their way out
Waste of money
What a great sound for
such a low price
better than others I have purchased at more than twice the price
GREAT DEAL
It's amazing to me how good these sound when using with iPad for music or movies - they are excellent quality and price was good
These headphones are not worth your money
They are supposed to be loud and they r not I can't hear my music that's how low they are
never buy again
Great buds
Sound is outstanding
The cord is just the right size not to small and thin like most
I would order these again when they go on sale
I have had these for only few weeks and now they don't work
I first thought it was my IPad that wasn't working
I tried a sony pair with it and I now know it is not my IPAD
I can't hear anything
I am very disappointed
It's everything I have dreamed what features these earbuds have
I loved the booming sound, the manageable cables, and the slick design
I couldn't think of one thing that would make me dislike this product
It is great
This product met my expectations and I am very happy with the results
Once I tried all the rubber inserts and found the one to fit my ear canal I was very impressed
These earbuds sound great and so far I've had no problems
The reinforced rubber gromet where the wires meet the earbuds will hopefully keep these working for a long time
i've never had the noise canceling ear buds before but these work great,  having for sizes of foam padding to choose from was excellent too as I have small ears
I'm not an audiophile or one who is even real picky with my audio
I use them for basic listening
Pleased so far
They don't stay in your ear unless you have a really big ear I suspect
I did like the color, but that is pretty useless
These sure beat the ear buds that come with mobile devices that are one size fits all
With 4 assorted tips you should have no problem finding a size that fits your ear
They are very comfortable and durable
I'm no sound quality expert but for the price these beat the sound and comfort of OEM ear buds
Bought two of these, looked like a steal at the time
The Blue Steel one's right headphone died within a week
The black one's are working fine, but are still a below average product
The cable is so stiff that any little pull will brake them
They last me a week
They didn't sound that great
Very good isolation from ambient noise
Great detail for movie dialog, used on train ride and no issue with ambient noise
These little headphones are perfect for what I was looking for- something that had a good sound but with a small footprint(size)
The sound is amazing for the size-very clear and crisp; stereo separation is great
I couldn't be more satisfied unless they had been free (but the price wasn't bad either)
Sound Clarity not good
Bass and effect not impressive
Expected a good performance but not satisfied with the purchase
Not sure if the earphones is faulty or the output of earphone is that much only
I used the headphones sparingly for less than a month and the left earbud came apart
Amazon is cool to replace it but in terms of reviewing the headphone
Good sound but shoddy construction on the ones I initially received
The Jlab JBuds work great - -clear sound, fit well, love the color
It looks better out of the package than in the picture
Would definitely buy them the next time I need earbuds, definitely recommend them
i bought 2 pair, the pink was for my ex and she liked them very much
i bought a different color for myself and i know they work really good, just wish they had volume control on the cord, however it comes with 4-5 different bud sizes for the ear, i use the smallest as it fits pretty snug and looks coolest w small size buds
Rattling sound from one of the earbuds
Used it only once and had yo stop since it kept on happening when you turn your head or move up and down
These are still better than the standard earbuds that Apple persists in packaging with their stuff
The cables are more sturdy but not flat like the best-of-class Beats Tour earbuds
But those go for $149 or more…these are less than $10
Not necessarily throwaway…but I'm not worried about losing them or profiling a target on the subway for urban snatch and grab
For the first 2 or 3 months after I bought these earbuds, I could not have been happier
The sound was terrific, they were very comfortable, fit well, stayed in my ears while I worked out, and blocked out other sound very well
However, after a few months of use, the right earbud started "cracking" every once in awhile
I first thought it was just due to static in my apartment over the winter, but it has continued to happen
The sound is still great and I've had no other problems, but it very annoying as the cracking is relatively loud and would catch me off guard while I was trying to study
I didn't treat these earbuds the best, but nothing too terrible so it might be just something wear and tear related
Regardless, fantastic earbuds for the price
I would definitely take a chance that this wouldn't happen again and buy another pair if I was looking for some
This was the replacement piece and did not even last for a week
I had to return it and cancel the order
I have been using Lenovo earphone for calls and listening to music I use it everyday still doing fine
Sound quality is not great, noise cancellation is good, it fits little tight and feels slightly uncomfortable after sometime
Product quality seems to be very bad, It lasted only for a week, one of ear piece stopped working
I ordered replacement and exact same thing happened
Either they are selling defective pieces or this J5 series is flawed
Would never buy JBuds anymore
I have Lenovo's headphone with mic a very basic version of US $ 10
99 and its been working fine for more than 2 years
I was looking for something better
but looks like I have to go back to my old headphones and wore it out
The sound is okay but I wasn't paying attention to the pictures and didn't notice that the ear buds are slick instead of foam
These will be my emergency back ups
To start off, the mic is decent
Onto the review itself: The sound quality is pretty decent
It's nothing special that made me go "Wow
" but it's solid and fine
The earbuds themselves are made of a solid metal material so they feel solid and comfortable in your ears
The wires, on the other hand, will fray after a while
The headphones lasted about 5-6 months overall before dying out in one ear
So be wary of this when buying the product
Overall, it's solid and good
They work great I enjoy them when I use them the sound is great glad I decided to order them
I really like these
They are comfortable, and stay in my ears when jogging
The sound is very good too
The headphone jack seems to be kind of messed up
The part that plugs into my phone bends when I'm working out and it's in my pocket, as all headphone jacks do, but it cuts the sound in and out
Everything else about these is perfect
Sound quality is terrible
If you want cheap in-ears, go with Philips headphones (they go for about $8 and are WORLDS better)
Gym headphones at best
I bought these at a nice price
These headphones sound great,  The sound is clear and crisp
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice affordable headphones for their device
For the life of me, I cannot get these things to stay in my ears
It's almost as if they are too heavy, or that the in-line controls weigh too much, because if I do something more active than just sitting, they end up falling out in just a few steps
I've tried every size of the ear pieces that they send with it, and no luck
I would avoid these
These were purchased to replace a long overdue set that I've had for a while
While they were not the best that I've used, they were well worth the price I paid for them
I've had this style of earbud before, but never so flimsy
One of the ears lost sound after just 6 uses
Waste of money
Im so happy with this ear buds, the sound is very clear and they stay in my ear
The only thing that I don't like is that they are easy to tangled
These earbuds are probably the best bang for your buck earbuds i've ever had
Although the bass can be a little loose and perhaps a little bit overwhelming, the sound quality overall is amazing
I love how these are lightweight and keep that seal tight
I've used the J4 and J3 a couple years ago, but these are by far my favorites so far
Will update if issues arise with these headphones
Sound quality is good, except that the left earbud stopped working a week in
Never had earbuds that died so quickly
I've had these for a while now and I must say I'm disappointed
Yes, I use these while running
and they continually need to be readjusted to stay in my ears
Even just hanging out at home they have issues
Maybe my ear canals are too petite
Can't really say since I've not had much opportunity to check out other people's ear canals
These have really good sound for the price
Bass is a little loose and boomy at times, but midrange and highs are very clean and well defined
(You really do have to burn them in, however
They sound positively harsh right out of the package
)I don't think these are quite as good as my older J2s,  which have a smoother, silkier sound, but maybe that's because the older earbuds have been used for much longer
I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a OTR driver
They lasted less than a week and the rt side shorted out
VERY DISAPPOINTING
They are marketed as sturdy and good
HA
One of the worst purchases I have made from Amazon
Wasted money
JLAB has great quality I buy them in bulks as if im in costco
Skullcandys suck since they tend to break one side
I have been using these for a long time, and they are holding up quite well
Sound is good, but the "JBuds J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones" sound much better
Generally, when I am purchasing earbuds, I like to get them in the store, so I can try them out before I buy them
But the reviews and the price on these JLab buds was so good, I decided to take a risk
Boy am I glad I did
The sound and the operation of these buds are just fabulous
They produce a clean sound that reproduces faithfully across the entire sound spectrum
Now, I should tell you that I am by no means a professional audiophile
I can't tell you that they sound warm or cool, or bright or soft or anything like that
They sound great to my ears is all I know
One of the great features about these buds is the JLabs website has a burn-in service
Just about any earbuds you might buy will sound pretty good right out of the box
But running a burn-in program makes them sound so much better by stretching the diaphragms and working out the magnets in the buds
This features a white noise, a pink noise, and a full spectrum sound generated for about a minute each on an infinite loop
So, you can plug in your buds, set the volume to medium, stick 'em in a drawer or in another room or whatever,  run the sound generator for a day or two and for just a little time investment, your phones are better than new
I am very happy with these buds and if they last for a year or so, I will feel that they were well worth the investment
Dead on arrival
The right side of this earbuds, the one with the mic, does not work: no sound comes out of it
I bought another one like a year ago and it was find, but this one had to be thrown away
Bad luck for me this time
I picked these up when they were on sale for about $10
These headphones work as good as any other pair of headphones I have had that I have paid $25 for
Great fit in ears and comes with other size plugs for your ears for perfect fit
Does very good job with noise isolation and I have had no problems with the cord getting tangled
Only bad thing to say is the highs and mids could be a bit clearer but they are definitely worth buying especially if you love bass
I am shocked that these put out this much bass
They seem to be built pretty durable
If you love bass than YOU should definitely try these
These were the first buds I've used that did not come with a product
The sound quality was a level above the stock buds I've been using
They do have some limitations
When the cable is moved while using the buds they do make a low pitched noise
Gets a but annoying using them moving around
Since I'm a desk jockey, this not an Issue for me
Good sound, great value
I picked up a pair of these by complete chance during JLabs' Grab Bag sale
Mine were the Purple J5 Metal Earbuds and they worked as I expected
I had never bought from JLabs before so I was unsure of how their products would be, but for just $7 for a chance to have ANY of their products (even a $60 portable bluetooth speaker) I couldn't pass it up
Sadly I did not get some crazy expensive product but I did get these very nice earbuds
First thing I noticed when opening the packaging is that these earbuds are VERY well made
The metal on them is not the cheap thin, junky feeling metal, they are solid feeling and sturdy metal buds; a nice surprise
The next thing you will notice when unwrapping these is that they come with a warranty, very nice add on but it was expected
These also come with several different sizes earbud rubber pieces
These come in very handy if you want to get the sizing just right
The functionality of these earbuds actually surprised me for being such a cheap set of headphones
I browsed several noise canceling and in ear earbuds, but some can get pretty pricey, up to $150
These work excellently for me
They reduce noise, so much so that at just a low volume of music, you can not hear someone speaking loudly right in front of you
Which brings me to my next point, the sound quality
The quality overall is pretty good, some songs sound a little "odd" through them but most sound crystal clear and perfectly
These earbuds also have a nice level of bass with them, so you can really get into your music using them
Overall these headphones are AMAZING for the price of just $10
I would gladly pay more for them, but again the quality of the sound they give is slightly (just ever so slightly) reduced
I'm sure if you want to spring for a more expensive pair you'll get better than these, but for just $10 you can't beat these
If you are on a budget or looking for a cheap pair of headphones as a back up or temporary set THESE are the ones for you
You definitely get what you pay for with these headphones
Muddy middle and very lacking on the high end of the sound spectrum
Bass is OK but quite "loose" sounding
Overall for the price and for my use as a spare, they're acceptable
However if you really care about what your music sounds like, get something else
they work great with m y kindle or laptop
great guality for the price
I choose pink to match my kindle holder
Bout these for a school's prom "Tech Basket" and they are perfect
Just as described
Also has minimalist packaging, very slick and semi-eco friendly
Great value and build, worked out in them, and gave them a good sweat, bass was good, highs wear nice
Great buds, but the quality of the cord has rendered the left side completely broken after only the first week
Since I enjoy listening to music through both of my ears, one star until they fix it
Average build and sound quality
The wires and everything rub together and make noise
However, the ultimate test is the sound quality and these just sound okay
For anyone who cares about sound quality, move right along and choose something none JLab
these ear buds have amazing bass response for how small they are
they also provide great clarity to the high's , and the mids are amazing
the best part about these are that they provide an amazing seal
they also provide okay noise isolation when you're listening to music
but they can be a little bit uncomfortable at times
but overall these are amazing ear buds
Got these via the JLabs grab bag promotion
They are super comfortable
Sound is clear
Sadly, bass is nowhere to be found
If you like EDM, hip hop, or Bootsy Collins, you might want to look elsewhere
I love them
Good sound quality, well made
I use them to talk on the phone too
Gives you more freedom to multi-task
Only downside they didn't come with a case
Not what I expected for jlab
these buds just don't compare to other high-end earbudstheir ok but not Great
Wire connection to phone pulled out and now I get static on calls
Poor quality for $25
00
I would like them replaced
Sounds great and comes with FOUR sizes of ear bud
I'll definitely be ordering a few more of these asap
Great headphones
fits perfectly
perfect for gym, specially cardio
Sound is okay for price but definitely recommended for gym use
i think ive had these for a couple of years
they were very good
i listen to music every day on the train, but i would not consider myself hardcore
i dont pay attention to equalizer settings, so these are may not be for the person who needs a certain level of bass or treble for certain music genres
i just needed them to get to and from work
i dont think they would be a good choice for working out because they will fall out of your ear
they died recently, mostly because i toss them everywhere and my daughter chews on them
but i would recommend them highly
So my j3 earphones recently gave out (after almost a year of use) and i decided to replace them,, i saw these newer models j5 and decided to buy them $19 is a cheap enough price for good earphones
fast forward about two weeks of use and one of the sides started cutting off
don't buy these, try your luck with j3, if you take care of them they will last a while, not sure if i just got a faulty pair but these ones are garbage
After only three weeks of moderate use, one of the buds started to buzz
Just one, so it wasn't installed background white noise
It wasn't a problem with the jack connector that killed the sound; that was the previous pair that I had of an earlier model (now discont) owned's demise, after four and a half months use
The sound quality and comfort were lovely, it was all lovely
While it lasted
Great fit with 3 sizes of ear plug, sturdy cord and great range of sound with great base, value purchase
Very nice for the for the price
Has a really good feel in ear and not so bulky
I did not get the deep bass I expected but they still have a quality sound
These JLab ear buds sound great and work well with my Galaxy S4 Active
They can produce deep, distortion-free bass and crisp highs
I like how they come with 4 different size tips
You really can't go wrong for the price
I would have given 5 stars if they came with a carrying case like the comparable Skullcandy earbuds
Overall, I am pleased with my purchase
While the headset looks sexy and fancy, it unfortunately only lasted 2 weeks of usage
One earbud no longer gives out any sound
I bought this as a gift to my son
Unfortunately, by the time my son get to use it, its already out of return period
Don't buy it if want something last more than 2 weeks
Not quite 5 star but no issues to complain about
A really good set of headphones with mic for iphone
I have had a number of earbuds, including some pretty expensive models, but the J5's are so awesome, don't sepend more than you have to on earbuds; these j5 model ones are terrific for the price
light weight, tin can sound with a lot of static, I've gotten
99 cent earbuds that felt better to wear
I love use these earbuds
They help me out on a daily basis
They are very comfortable and quick and easy to use
Just plug it in and be safe
Randomly received two of these in the latest JLab Grab Bag
At about $7
50/each they are well worth the money
However, if you're paying the full ~$20, then you have a lot to consider
The version that I have does not include a mic or volume controls
The sound quality is very good for the price that you would pay
Bass is very prevalent
Highs and mids are clear
These are much better in terms of build quality and sound in comparison to JLab JBuds or some of the OEM headphones that comes with smartphones today
Overall, a very good buy
Last Three Weeks
By the time I realized something was wrong with them, I was out of Amazon return period
JLab warranty process was too frustrating, so ended up throwing these out sadly
wish MFR would reach out to me
While the sound is ok on these earbuds with good bass and clear sound, they wont last long
I had them for 5 months and the left earbud is gone, no audio at all
Its hard for me to believe amazon will let these people put a 'list' price of 60 bucks on this junk
Its clearly not a quality product
Not worth the 20 bucks it sells for on amazon
Look somewhere else for better quality earbuds
I've always had good experiences with jlabs
Their earbuds typically last me a couple years, which for the price is expected
I can't justify spending a lot more money on something that gets rolled up and thrown into your pocket/bag everyday
They sound great, comparable to my last couple pairs of j-3s
Only had them for a few weeks, so I can't comment on durability yet, but they do have the stress reliefs at each wire connection
Originally the headphones I got had a defect because the play/pause/skip button came off after only one days use
The return was fast and easy to my convenience and it didn't even require the pair to be sent back (which I found to be a great return policy)
The next pair sent however was defective as well because this very same button did not function at all this time
When filing this NEW claim for the REPLACEMENT pair, I was told to send back this pair and I would receive a new one
I was not given a "free shipping" method of sending them back and had to spend the minimum of $10 which I shouldn't have had to since it was jlabs fault to begin with
I didn't complain though, just sent them back only to recieve a completely different pair without the play/pause/skip button even on it
A totally different pair of headphones
Not the ones I originally paid for
Last week I spoke with a Julian about how this is the third problem (or first depending how you look at it that it is the same issue that has still not been solved) I've now had with jlab
He told me he would send a "free shipping" label this time for my inconvenience and the new pair would arrive by Saturday
I have not received anything in my spam/ or regular mail to send them back, however I DID just receive another pair that are correct, but the play/pause/skip button does not work with my iphone 5 (whereas the very first pair DID so I know it's not a comparability issue) I have avoided being the type bitch online with a negative review, but this company is proving to be incompetent
The sound the headphones put out is actually very good which is why I gave it 2 stars rather then 1, but come on, This is the FOURTH pair now and its STILL not working properly
There's a reason it's always marked down from $65 to $20
My j5 went through the laundry
Both wash and dry and they still work perfectly
These earbuds really are incredibly strong
just average, nothing special, there are better ear phones on the market
Nice looking but sound is average compared to others
Fits the ear well
I had used the J3 previously and this is a much better fit
It comes with several sizes of ear pieces
The cable seems strong, but time will tell after I snag it on something, which is what happened to my J3
A O K, got them for my husbands birthday, he loves them because they are soft and he can lye on them while listening to his favorite music
The part that goes into your ears are extremely harrd and they broke sound went out of one ear
I am in the process of returning them as we speak
I've gone through 3 pairs of these headphones
Granted my first pair came apart because I worked out with them, but even then I expected to material to hold up relatively well
It didn't, fine
Not all headphones are meant to be workout headphones
But I liked how light weight it was, how the ear buds fit, and the sound was great
But my second pair I treated very well, but at one point the actual speaker completely separated from its housing, a problem I've read a few others have had
So Jlab sent me replacements
Jlab for what its worth is really good about replacing your earbuds
Not even two days in, the left ear bud of my 3rd pair just started getting spotty connectivity
The music would just go in and out
Within two days
Even though Jlab will most likely send me a free replacement, it's not even worth the hassle anymore
I may go back to the J4's
They were heavy, but least they were durable
still can't believe little ear buds like these produce great bass tones
for the price these ear buds can handle all ranges especially the progressive metal music i exclusively use them for
love em
I gave these earbuds to my daughter for her birthday
They lasted a week before the right side stopped working
I bought them on the cyber Monday specials so now am I stuck with defective merchandise because of the lag in time from purchase to gifting
After couple of hours a day, a few weeks in wire right at the jack the music started going on and off
They sounded great for the two weeks that they worked
Very lightly used and well taken care of yet the left earbud died with no warning
Luckily JLabs sent a new set or it would be one star, but already having trouble with the new pair and have only used them for an hour or so
I had these on and they got caught on something minor and the cord ripped in two
Threw them away and accepted the loss
I guess blue tooth is the way to go
The unit had good sound quality while they lasted
Buy them at a reduced price and don't get attached to them
They wont last
Only the left one worked was not satisfied at all & will never order this brand again
Don't order thes3
You get great sound great comfort and a great price I love the choice of fun colors too
Buy extras your friends will want them
I have been using some low quality earbuds, so these J5M type are quite the Audio Upgrade
I have a LG 840G cellular and was hoping these would work for the music playing as well as toggle the answer button upon receiving calls, and it does perfectly
These J5M will not toggle next song, on my LG 840G though (not I-Phone) but the sound quality is very good
The comfort is there and these fit inside the ear nicely
I don't know why a warranty as these are so cheap as to be disposable
I got this for using it at office but was disappointed and surprised to see that the scratchy nose from any touch or movement on the wire propagates to the ear bud
The noise is very annoying
I tried all the ear buds that came along with the headphone but all are same
Stop using it after 2/3 times
They have a better fit for smaller ears than the J2s (medium cushions were too big on the J2 and the small was too small--the medium is perfect on these)
Like many of the Jbuds line, eventually one side stops working
but even though I use the earbuds for hours a day and perspire, etc
they tend to last at least six months on average,  so that's a REALLY long time for me to have a pair last
I just took out a new pair as the last ones stopped working and ordered some more so I always have a pair on hand for when the old ones give out
Work great for a little, super high end
Key is only for a while
After a few weeks, one side gave out and I am left with only one ear bud working now
But while they work and when they are new, they are some of the best headphones I have ever had
These headphones sounded fine enough when they worked
I didn't have extremely high expectations for cheap earbuds anyway
But after about three months, the buds would alternate where one would work and one would not
Eventually they also would occasionally give me a shock
The earbuds say that they have a one year warranty, but you have to enter a code on JLab's website within six weeks of purchase, I think
Does anyone actually want to do that for a warranty
Yes, please, send me more spam emails :/Anyways, I would definitely not recommend these to anyone, even for the price
These buds sound great
I've had a lot of ear buds over the years, and they always end up broken, so we'll see
I did register them on the JLabs website
The warranty is nice
The wires are pretty light gauge
I like heavier wires or a braided jacket on them
You just don't see that anymore
Anyways, 5 stars for the awesome sound and the warranty
This is the first ear buds I've had from JLabs, I will probably buy them again if they don't break right away
Flimsy, no buttons for iPhone use
Buds seem like they'd fall out of ear, I returned mine before I even listened to them
My daughter loves these, but lost one of the rubber earpieces and now can't use them, too bad I can't get replacements
I have known a couple people to own J5 Earbuds and they swore by them, so when it came time to getting a new pair of earbuds these were the first to come to mind
Absolutely love them
Style, Quality, Price
EVERYTHING
Would have given 5 stars except when I ordered these I got 2 day shipping as I really needed a new pair quickly
When they arrived they were the Silver j5 earbuds and not the black/electric blue ones
Called to have a replacement sent out which amazon was very friendly and apologetic about the mistake
They treated me as a customer the way a customer should be treated when a mistake was made
Only draw back was it taking an additional 2 days to get the correct ones
I purchased as a gift based on ratings and my son says they are working quite well
I would recommend
The sound was average and they broke in a week
I would not have wasted the money if I knew they were so poor quality
I bought these as a present for my nephew
He used them for one day and then the right ear bud stopped working
THIS HAS BEEN A  GREAT ADDITION AND GOOD QUALITY TOO
LISTEN TO MUSIC AND TAKE CALLS ON YOUR IPHONE FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY
I enjoyed the sound with these earbuds, but I have only had them about 3 weeks and used them about 8 times, and the sound went out in the right earbud
I don't know if it is just a bad pair, but I am very unhappy they didn't last very long
These are very comfortable and deliver great sound
They are very sound reducing too, much better than the ones you get with your ophone
They were on a black friday bargain and well worth it
I've been a big fan of Jlab, they've always had great sound quality, build, and price
The Jbud 4's remain my favorite, they're a little heavier but very durable
The J5M's feel really nice, light and have great sound
They however are not really built to last
I tried using them as work out headphones, and they simply did not last
The in-ear part detached from the housing on one pair, the wiring got disconnected somehow in another pair (from just normal use, not gym use), and I'm currently on my third pair (I don't know why I keep going back to it), but I'm simply too afraid to take it around and put it through everyday use
I will say Jlab's warranty is amazing and they've always replaced my headphones, but at some point when is enough enough
Within a month of purchase one of the buds died completely
Considering they wouldn't stay in my ears when I ran, I was not heartbroken
I use these earbuds-style headphones with my Kindle music
They are pretty phenomenal---very small but they make the music sound like I am listening to a large stereo system
Love the sound; comfort is good
I would recommend them to anyone who wants to listen to their music on a small device
Oh, yes, I like that there is a color choice
Matches my Kindle Fire cover
I think the JLab-J5 Earbuds are the best deal for the money out there
The sound is great, quality is also super
The cables are Kevlar and reinforced for long life
I've had to replace mine only because my 6 month old Labrador Retriever is stronger than Kevlar and chewed the cables
Otherwise, I've had them for over two years with no problems
Take advantage of JLab's "Breakin" software on their site
You plug your earbuds into the headphone jack on your computer and start the program
It runs  your new earbuds through a wide variety of frequencies and sounds to break them in
There is a noticeable difference after break-in
I've had more than a few pairs of the JBuds J5
I love the way they fit, they've got great sound quality, and even though they are less expensive than some of the other brands, I don't feel like I'm sacrificing quality (sound or otherwise)
I use them for running, working at my desk, and I have a pair with an in-line mic for my phone
The life span on these is about a year
My experience is that at around a year of use (not abuse) they almost always lose sound in just one of the sides
It's annoying, but given the price, I'll keep buying them
I got this pair of earbud for my daughter as her Christmas gift
The earbud was fairly well constructed with nice angled phone plug connector
After two months, the earbuds started to exhibit connection problem, and the sound came on and off depending how you move the wire near the connector
Luckily, these earbuds are still under warranty
I am a pretty loyal JLab customer
I got my first pair of JLab J4 in 2011 and really liked the ruggedness
Since then, I recommended J4 to my friends and bought two more J4 in 2012
In total I own three J4, one J4M, one J3M and one J5
Four out of 6 exhibited some kind of defect after several months
Fortunately, they were covered under the warranty
Nevertheless, I still need to pay shipping fees to send products in for replacement
As much I love JLab products, its product reliability is really spotty
You will not be disappointed by the JLab product, especially the more rugged one like J4/J4M, but be prepared to deal with warranty process
I would avoid earbud with slim wire like J4M though
Out of the box use was great, good sound, good options, good thick cord and beefed up joints
These became my daily work out/ in office ear buds, a good 2-5 hours of use most daysBut 3 months in, the right bud broke, so I cut it off and just used the one bud, but now 4 months later it has died
They didn't even last a year :(I would buy another pair but I would want them to last at least a year
4 stars for pretty good product, 1 star due to breaking
Not what I expected based on the reviews and price
I would suggest going less expensive for the same value or moving up to the next level of price range of brands
I purchased these for about $11 during an Amazon lighting deal in Dec 2013
I thought it was a good deal at about half-price
Little did I know these would only half-work
These are great headphones for the price
I gave a couple as gifts and they were apreciated
Quality of the microphone is good too
These headphones are awesome
Headphones usually last me 5-8 months
I had a pair of these headphones and they only lasted me a year (the left earbud stopped working) BUT these headphones are by far the best bang for your buck
The sound is dope, the price is cheap, and these are the most durable headphones I have ever owned
I left these in my bathing suit by accident on vacation and swam in a pool for 2 hours
Later I was upset because I like these headphones, but I only found out they still worked
These same headphones went through the wash without a scratch or any difference in sound
If I didn't swim with them and wash them, they probably would have lasted far longer than only 1 year, but my point is, for the price these are the best headphones on the market
I got these after my old ones broke, but out of the box the right earbud didn't work
I sent an email to them, and they responded quickly and sent me another pair
After this i get them and the left earbud occasionally works if i stay really still which is hard to do while gaming or even listening to music
Good headphones but got unlucky
twice
For some reason when I put these on it creates a suction in my inner ear which is rather painful
Other than that they're nice
These lasted a whopping six weeks before the jack connection broke apart
Sound was good but not worth it for six weeks of use
Ordered it because of the reviews and my old ones broke (only 1 side works) but the right side doesn't work :(
Like the sturdy construction of the speakers
The soft pliable ear jackets that comes with them to make sure you get a comfortable fit also helps to cancel out back ground noise
I also notice that I don't have to keep repositioning the speakers while wearing them
Sound quality is very good
To make sure you get the longevity out of them I suggest buying the case for added protection
What can I say
They sound great
Good highs and deep lows
They're really good for the money and I would recommend them
I just wish they had a volume adjuster but you can't get everything at this price point
Great product for a great price
Pros:* Leave the headphones out for a second and the metal gets all cold, put them in and it feels great
* The audio quality is great, I've used them for a few weeks and the audio quality hasn't faded a bit
* Look and feel great
Con:* The microphone seems to act up from time to time and I can't always use it in calls (Why they lost a star
)
I bought these on sale, paid like 20 dollars for them
Good for 20 dollars but not great
Crapped out on me after a few months or so, felt a tad cheap
Sound quality was meh, but you get what you pay for I suppose
I just wish that they'd last more than a few months without the left side failing
The J5's are really amazing
I got my first pair about 2 years ago and LOVED them
For the price they are very nice, have good durability, and sound great
I liked having so many different colors to choose from
You have to remember that these are only 20 dollar headphones, so don't expect crazy good quality that you find after shelling out a few hundred dollars
But at the same time don't be fooled because they will still blow you away
I was amazed how nice they sounded for 20 bucks
You can't buy a nicer pair of headphones for the cost
I didn't have any problems putting them into my ear or anything
They are very durable
I don't beat my headphones to death, but I don't treat them like a fragile antique either
I used my first pair for a solid six months and I didn't have the slightest problem until one day the right earbud went out completely
I have no idea why but it just stopped working
I contacted JLab, and they sent me a brand new pair of J5's in any color I wanted for free
They were extremely easy and nice to deal with
I didn't have to send in the broken pair and wait before I could get new ones
I was jamming with some new J5's within  a week of my first pair breaking
I had my second pair for at least 6 months before I unfortunately lost them
I will say that I had zero problems with my second pair and they actually went through my washer and dryer on accident at least once
I had no idea until afterwards, but they still worked perfectly
I really enjoyed my J5's and was astonished at the excellent customer service that JLab provided
Great company with cheap, yet spectacular headphones for the price
JLab is the way to go
Great sound for the price
Good bass and ok mids good highs
Will be another pair for a back up
Needed new earbuds so I found and ordered
While I waited I purchased an cheap pair to use until I received these
They were here in 2 days and they are awesome
Didn't even need the cheap pair
Thanks for a good product and quick shipping
JLab is the only brand that I use to listen to music, and especially audio books on my Samsung Galaxy Player (an iPod Touch like device)
You can't go wroing with JLab earbuds
They have consistently excellent quality
Not worth the money they worked great for about two days and then the sound started cutting out now they're completely useless
5 stars
Worth the money
this thing is very durable
The sound is really good for the price
Highly recommend
Sound quality is decent, but they don't stay in the ear
Good for phone calls, but not great for an audiophile
I've used the headphones in quiet and noisy environments and found the sound quality to be great but have had complaints from people I'm on the phone with that I sound garbled
I am now using them solely for listening to music and feel they are a great item for the price
I would purchase them again with the understanding they are for audio only
I did NOT purchase them at full price and would have been very satisfied if I had spent much more then the 26
00 I paid for them
If you want audio headphones
great purchase, looking for a handsfree for your phone
move on and consider other options
Tried several small bud models before
Just didn't sound good or fit good until now
Really happy with this one
Great price too
son loves it,especially the firm, loud bass,well finished pair, have lasted the first few months,quite a good set
I used these headphones in the gym for three weeks and for no reason the right ear bud stopped working
These seemed like great headphones
My daughter loved them
They had a good weight to the earpieces and she told me they had excellent sound
They appeared to be well made as the cord had reinforcements at the plug, the "Y" where the cord spits and at the earphones
The earbuds were made from metal and the rubber ear seals fit well and came in enough sizes to get a custom fit
However, with all of that being said, the left earbud has now blown
If you've ever heard a blown speaker, you know what it sounds like
My daughter does not listen at extreme levels
I have a limit set on her iPhone so she can't turn the volume above a parent controlled level
We even followed the "burn in" procedure specified on the JLabs website
Yes, there is a specific procedure - they even have a sound file you can download to perform the burn in - which takes 20 hours
Unfortunately, with the rush of Christmas, I neglected to register the earbuds and we have misplaced the envelope that has the serial number required
It's too late to return to Amazon and I can't return to JLabs because they aren't registered
I'm just glad I didn't pay over $20 for these
Guess I'll keep looking for something that will actually last
No more JLabs products for me…I'm voting with my feet
Customer service was ZERO help - basically if your didn't register - they don't care - at least the rep I talked with
She had a "salty" attitude to say the least and almost seemed to enjoy denying me any help
I got these beds on sale
The buds fall out of my ears very easily (this doesn't happen with other buds I use) and the sound in one of the buds is a tad muffled
Would send back, but it isn't worth the trouble
I bought these headphones almost a year ago now, and they have been nothing but fantastic until now
Now every time i use them i am in constant pain
Somehow static electricity is building up in these and shocking the inside of my ears
It makes them completely unusable
It happens when using my ipod, my computer or anything else i connect them to
Its a real shame because these sound fantastic
I really enjoyed the noise canceling, and the sound quality was excellent
However, after 2 weeks, there was no sound coming out of one of the ear buds
I returned it and got a replacement, and the same thing happened with a second set
I think it's a connection problem because if I jiggle the wire sometimes it will work briefly
Anyhow, going to get a different set of ear buds
I found these earbuds on sale so I figured it was worth a try
I really didn't like the way they felt in my ear, and the sound is not that good
I am really happy with these
They are never tangled and always have good quality sound
I liked them so much I ordered two more
I buy jlab all the time
Not only are they timely but the warranty is fabulous
Good for running because they stay in your ears
Bought these for my Dad for a gift and they seem to be working well so far
They are definitely on the cheaper end of quality but can't pass up the price when these get ruined so quickly and frequently anyway in his workouts, no matter the quality
They're alright
I would recommend these for anyone who doesn't want to pay for a Skull Candy of Beats
Good headphones, descent price but an alright sound quality
I've liked my Jlabs and this is the third pair owned
Cord durability is better with these than prior J3 models as the cords appear to be better reinforced at the ends
As to sound quality for the price they can't be beat
Way surpass any others in the price range once broken in and that's key to any earbuds
Must break them in properly and these do not disappoint on either side bass or treble are both clean and midrange is solid
I wish they came with a case but for the price can't complain
I've always loved all the Jbuds I've tried
But these J5 buds are probably my new favorites
Great full sound in a compact earbud
Nice solid feel in the cord and plug
Great marked down price on Amazon
Edit_ Now I know why the price keeps going down on these great sounding buds (now down to 9
99 I see)
After only a couple weeks of use, one of the buds suddenly quit working for no apparent reason
I figure, well, stuff happens, and order another pair
ONE WEEK
One week is all I sadly get out of this pair
Guess I need to try a different brand
Bye bye Jbuds
You're not going to screw me again
Base in not that bad
Sound is as usual good
Fine headphones
Microphone works okay
Had many colors to choose
Unlike so many other earbuds, these just don't fall out
They sit comfortably without having to rearrange them
The sound is clear and dynamic, and their ability to be used when at the gym make them my favorites
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong here
but when I wear these, the slightest motion sends so much noise into my ears that I find myself sitting neath the Bodhi tree, motionless
Also, they really do create a crazy suction in the ears, which is probably good if you're in motion, but I can't be in motion with these
On the plus side, they seriously block out background noise
My daughter loves them and the sound is great
I can be sitting right beside her and can't hear the music she's playing
Dude, there are like a 1000 people singing in those tiny little things
I recommend them to anyone with ears
You can have good in-ear headphones with crisp sound and a powerful base
The cable stiffness is a source of noise itself, since it vibration can be quite disturbing while you are on the move, but I had this problem with all the in-ear headphones I have used so far
The price is one of the main highlights, as long as the Amazon offer is active
The listed price is far too high for this quality
Btw, this applies only to the GREY/GRAPHITE headphones
I also tried the black ones and, although they have the same model name and look in the pictures, the actual technical characteristics are different
And the graphite ones sound way better than the black ones
The Jlabe earbuds were just as described and the product arrived promptly and well packaged
I will order again
I sleep with them in and they are very comfortable
These are the best in ear headphones I have ever owned
The noise cancelation is superb
So far it is durable
I have yet to find anything wrong with it
He liked the different size ear pieces, so he could pick the one that was most comfortable for him
He said they are loud
Nice earphones
They are having very good sound quality and fits well in our ears no matter the size of the ear buds
mic and headset came as advertised, distorts when on full blast which i guess is expected, fits well and came with extra ear buds
These headphones work well: the sound quality is good (not excellent of course), and the microphone works well
It is quite durable as well
In every aspect, it is much better than the Samsung galaxy headphone that I purchased
The only problem is that microphone is too far from the mouth
You have to find a way to bring it to your mouth
Never had an issue with these and I've had them going on five years
This little babies get me through the day with my music and that's all I wanted
Crisp, clear sound and sits in my ear perfectly
:)
I got these for my son and he says there are just (OK); I tried them and to me the sound is good
They appear to be well made
these things sound pretty good
i dont thnk you would be disapppinted
But
if u already have or had some top of the line
you may not like
Hey
i like them
Have had these for about 5 months now
I also own a pair of J3's and J2's and bought these mainly because of the inline mic
I keep them in 2-3 hours a day most days
The metal housing is quite compact making them fit extremely comfortably in my ears
I am not an audiophile so can only say that the vocal clarity and bass exceed that of similarly priced earbuds that I have tried from other companies
The mic also appears to perform well, at least according to folks on the other end
I deducted one star because the left earbud recently failed on me
I was hoping for greater longevity
At least JLab has a fairly straightforward RMA system and customer service responded quite quickly (within 24 hours) over email when I had a question about the return
I have not received the replacements yet, but hopefully will get more mileage out of them since I do really enjoy using this model
The ear pieces do not fit very well, I have tried several of the sizes and they fall out
Does not work well with my iPhone, breaks up
I hadn't found earbuds that I liked until I came across this set of JBuds
Very comfortable and great sound
Seeing as I go thru headphones like candy, these do just fine by me
While not as good as the Sony brand, these are a good set of earbuds
Earbuds seem to work better for me than regular headhpones
Great sound, I love it
Clear an clean no distortion
The color match my cellphone
Loud and crisp to enjoy for hours
I really like these
I was having trouble with my previous headphones falling out of my ears
These came with several size buds and the one size fits perfectly
The sound is great as well
I love the sound on these
Paid $25 for them
It comes with 8 rubber cups for a better fit
Turns out one of my ear canals is small than the other, so this came in handy
The snug fit gives them some noise canceling properties
I got these for exercising with my iPhone, and so far, they stay in my ears, even when the sweat starts rolling in
Out of the package only one bud worked with no sound coming from the other
Even the one that worked sounded so bad that I'm not up for a reorder
I like the sound these put out, it is better than other units I have tried in this price range
There is one issue though that is a complete deal killer
The cord generates static electricity that is released through the metal ring that joins the two halves of the bud together
The result is getting shocked just inside of my ear constantly while wearing it
It feels like I'm getting stung in my ear by a bug
When my current buds break I may bring these out again with some tape to insulate them
Bumping the cord produces a stethoscope type echo that reverberates into the earbuds
Every time the cord dragged across my clothes or bumped into something I could hear it
I contacted JLab and got a replacement that was no better than the first so I threw them away
This is my third pair of JBuds
I love their comfort in the ear, and the fantastic sound after the short break-in period
The first pair broke after three years of heavy duty use
I still have my second pair and bought this pair to use with my I-Phone, my other pair has no mic
All-in-all, a good product at a very good price
I have used JLab earbuds for several years now
They are the best for comfort and the sound quality is great
They don't work from the moment my daughter opened them on Christmas morning
So will be returning them
Unhappy purchase
The first pair I received one of the ear buds did not function, fist annoyance
Once I had a pair that worked I noticed the following qualities:Pros:  Good construction, nice weight and fine sound, when they stayed in my earsCons:  Impossible to keep in your ear if you like to move your head
I suppose if you were wearing these while hastening the embrace of death they may be suitable
This is my biggest complaint as I usually wish to use earbuds while moving my head as it is an action i do quite often
Head phones will not stay connected to most devices
they pop out on the slightest touch when in an ipod touch or HTC smartphone
the female end is poorly constructed
I suppose these are fair to poor headphones for the price they are in
while they do sound better than the 10 dollar target ones it is next to impossible to hear them as they dangle from your chest
there has to be a better option in this price range than these as they truly suck
For the price I was able to purchase these they were worth every penny
For $16
00 ear buds they have excellent sound
These aren't professional quality by no means but I definitely got what I needed/ wanted for working around the house and for work
They do a good job of blocking ambient sounds and have good, deep but not overpowering bass
They sound better then any I have purchased at double the price even a couple at triple the price
Lasted over a whole year before the cable started to crap out
Worth every penny in my opinion
Sound quality isn't really an issue when you're spending this much on earbuds right
They  serve my needs very well and at a very fair price
Grand kids really like them, mike seems to work well
The difference between these and my J3Ms is that these have a more sleek design as well as more durable protective covers at the jack, the headphone split, and the cord attachment to the audio piece
The sound quality is standard to the JLab products, which is great
They don't come with the little case like some of the other JLab headphones do
This is my second set of JLab JBuds J5 Metal Earbuds Style Headphones
I was so impressed by the price vs functionality ratio of these headphone the first time that I bought a second set for my wife
It works like a charm, has excellent playback quality and comes with a number of earplug size alternatives
I registered both of my plugs on line at the JLab site and used their site to burn-in the ear-plugs
Love them
Ordered these twice
Both times the right ear bud was defective, producing zero sound
Not going to buy these again
I really wanted to like these headphones
They sounded great at first and I thought they would be a great higher-quality alternative for the stock headphones that come with the iPhones
First, since the button is an external button (an outie, not an innie) if you keep it attached to your phone like I like to, it will constantly play music or make phone calls in your pocket because it gets pressed just by sitting down, standing up, taking it out of your pocket, etc
Second, the button stopped working about 1 1/2 months after purchase
It wouldn't play music, pause music, and it wouldn't go to voice control when held down
So I would place calls with the phone screen, and just use the microphone to speak into, and that stopped working as well
The time to return it has passed, so I just ordered the stock iPhone headphones
Unfortunately not a good product
I was very exited to get these earphones cause I really liked the J3's that I used to have a few years ago, however after about a week the left side just stopped working and no sound comes out of it
I wasn't even rough with these earphones, I went out of my way to be extremely gentle with them and was surprised to find that it was not functioning properly today
I am sad :-(
Great earbuds
Comfy, crazy good sound quality, and solid all-around range
They can be a biiiit bass heavy at high volumes, but that's just how I like it
I bought these as a gift for my sister for Christmas, and I will say that there were many out there with better reviews and such, however these are the ones she wanted
The sound quality is ok, we will see how they are working after a few months
Not bad for the price
These were good earbuds for the price
I got them for my daughter and she loved them
You could order them with confidence and feel your getting your moneys worth
I picked these up for less than 15 dollars and for that price they are great but any higher and I would probably buy something different
My friend recommended these to me because they provided quality sound equivalent to other more expense brands, but are way more reasonable
I a very satisfied with my purchase, but the earbud covers did fall off
I guess thats why they give you extras
The left earbud stopped working immediately
That's really all I have to say
Otherwise the sound quality I enjoyed for about 10 minuets was wonderful
And they fit perfectly in my ears and the clip that it came is a great idea to keep something from pulling the earbuds out
I honestly think I just got a faulty product
I was going to send them back but then my new puppy found them useful to chew on
These showed up not working
Also, I purchased these as a "special deal" through amazon for 17
99
Less than a month later they are less
This makes me think amazon is putting things up as a special deal when in fact the price is elevated
So, my special deal headphones were at a higher price than normal
I'm now experiencing the joy of trying to find something to package these back up and send 'em back
All of this for a 16
23 item that I paid 17
99 for as a special deal from Amazon
I'll be cancelling Prime and shopping in stores where I can try things out first
I realize of course that amazon will review this and not allow it to be posted but I tried to use the amazon
com/feedback and of course this item was not there for me to review
all my other purchases but not this one
DONE WITH YOU GUYS
These are crazy strong noise cancelling, which is great because I work in a cubicle
My coworkers often stand right behind me struggling to get my attention when I have them on
I also use them for video conferencing with my computer, which is very convenient
Ordered one during Cyber Monday sale but got a DOA
I have to jiggle the 3
5 mm jack to hear sound coming from my stereo,MP3 player or smartphone
These buds are the perfect work-out buds
They manage to stay clean, stay in my ears while running for several miles, and channel my music excellently
They are also comfortable to wear
I would purchase again
Broke after a couple of months of use
Used them mainly to workout with
They have a great sound for the price, but I lost sound in one ear
The sound quality was ok, but the fit did not work for me, none of the inculded tips fit properly in my ear
Also when I had these in, if I moved around or talked the buds would click in my ear which got very frustrating and made it almost impossible to use these with my phone
I got these earbuds in 05/2011 as a gift and have used them at least 1 hour day 6 day a week
The right bud died today, left side still works normally
They show no wear and tear
No matter what size tip I put on the earbud I still find myself pressing it back into place but I do that with all in-ear buds
Best earbuds you can buy
Highly recommend them to anyway interested in low cost high quality ear buds
Texture is nice as well
The earbuds met my expectation for comfort and sound quality
I only pet peeve is the cable
When you move the cable while the buds are inserted, noise is generated which can be heard when music is played a low volume
I love this headphones but the sound could be better and have better clarity but I love it
the bass is good
awesome non better
6*891
a2
ayou can not get better quality or a better company than JLABS
imoBuy these head PHONES or your crazy
These phones have an extremely uneven frequency-response
There is quite a lot of chord-scrape noise
They are not very sensitive either
I had hoped to use them on both the desktop computer and the Android phone
Instead, I bought a pair of Sennhieser IE4 earphones for the computer, and I am very happy with them
I installed an equalizer ap on the phone in an attempt to flatten the response of the JBuds, but with indifferent results
Two stars rather than the minimum because they are small and comfortable
I have 3 pairs of these headphones
That alone should speak volumes on the quality the possess
I have tried more expensive models from Denon, Sony, Etymonics, and JBL and none have the sound quality or build quality of these units
I have a silver pair in my car a blue pair at the office and now the sneaker head color at home
I became tired of having to use sub-par headphones at each location and now I don't have to
The noise blocking ability of the sealed design is tremendous
Great on flights or in other areas with high background noise
The pair I've owned the longest shows little wear and still works as well as the new pair I just got
Can't speak highly enough of these
These have great sound quality and feel really comfortable
I have had to settle for over the ear headphones and this is the first set of earbuds that didn't bother me after 10 minutes of use
Very satisfied
comfortable, noise reducing earbud
Durable, with a good quality sound
Priced at a mid range earbud makes it a good quality buy
Mine came defective, missing the button on the mic unit
and the right side's volume is significantly lower than the left
This is not my first JLab's product, I first purchased the J3 Buds when it first came out in 2010
and they were great at first, but failed (no volume from one side) within 9 months
I got a replacement from JLabs promptly, but the replacement also failed within 7 months (same issue as previous pair)
At that point I decided to give other manufactures a try
But JLab's JBuds came with 4 sizes of the silicone where as others only come with 3 sizes
I came back to JLabs because of it, it gives me the best fit
Oh, and it's customer service I guess, No hassles warranty claim
However, Its disappointing to receive a defective product out of the box
I didn't expect much for a $20 pair of headphones but I was just looking for something to use in the car so i didnt have to hold my phone or use my bluetooth
Very disappointed in the product
The reviews were pretty good but after the first week of using them I could only hear sound in one side and the sound would short out off and on
I wish I would have kept the original packaging so I could send them back as they are useless to me at this point
Burn-in:theses sound good for the money and include different size tips to fit your ears
make sure to break them in for at least 60hrs to properly burn them in
i found that they achieved good sound after about 40 hrs, but optimal sound quality after 75 hrs of burn in
if you have no idea what iam talking about then i recommend you first visit their website, ([
] and follow the simple directions, then do some research on the internet to catch up
Sound Quality:overall they sound really good with all varieties of music
i use the sound equalizer on my phone to bring out the highs and round out the bass
so for the money they sound great
if an audiophile then you will most likely find these flat in the highs with the mids in the background and the bass sounding murky
especially if you are not using an equalizer to curve the sounds to your likings
however i was able to tune these buds to make them sound pretty good
honestly i was surprised at how much bass these could handle and with proper tunning i got a rich experience
although id rather recommend the "Sennheiser CX 300B MK II" for almost the same price range
those have much better sound curves and produce a clearer more precise sound out of the box with No equalizer
(burn-in mode still required)Sound Isolation:considering the cost of theses and with a proper fit using the including tips, id have to say at a medium low volume they do very well at blocking out most of outside sounds
the one draw back is if it is very windy then you will have to increase the volume to compensate
Build Quality:these where my second pair to purchase the J5M
the first ones lasted extremely well
i used them from daily music listening, playing games on my android (LG-D800), yard work and riding my bike/skateboard
with that in mind i can say i never had an issue with thses wiggling out of my ears and they are extremely comfortable
however my second pair only lasted a few months before the left ear piece started to have a crackling sound followed by some intermittent static
shortly afterwards the left ear piece stop working completely
lame to say the least
my first pair i could have completely understood if they died after a few months with the heavy usage and hardship i put them thru
but my second pair was more of a back up and didnt last long with hardly any use
unfortunately my second pair were out of the return range and ended up being a trash give away
i reluctantly purchased a third pair as they where on sale in the $14 range and figured i should  try one last time at this price
i chose a different color and was sorry i ordered them
about 2 weeks after i got them they acted exactly the same way as my previous second pair with the exception of this time it was the right ear channel acting up
I immediately sent them back and Big A refunded everything including shipping and tax
thanks as usually Amazon
Other Thoughts:i noticed the second and third pair had the microphone and call button on the right ear channel, where as the very first pair i had originally owned, the microphone and call button was on the left ear channel
this may seem an unhelpful detail, but it does show that they changed their manufacturing processes since my first purchase and it might be an indication of why the build quality went down hill, or maybe i just got unlucky
Great sound and volume
Easy fit, love the color
Soft and flexible
Made a great Christmas gift for old or young
Good sound and high quality, durable material and brings several adapters to use the one that best fits in your ear
You pay for what you get
This pair of headphones is pretty good
Obviously you aren't paying for high end headphones, so don't expect the best sound, but it makes for a great cheap pair
The only issue I have with these is that people on the other end have a hard time hearing me when I use this with my phone
I bought these as a part of a Cyber Monday sale, and the sound quality wasn't great
I figured, becuase they were on sale, that was fine
But then the wuality just got worse and worse
the sound quality comes switched from good to bad and back all the time, and its almsot never possible to hear the vocal track if the song has ANY instruments over it
got these for my girl and she is head over heals
got the one with Mic so she can use while on the go
very stylish, neat, small and appreciated for her ears
she loves music and she got rid of her dumb stock phone headphones
I tried to use a pair of these earbuds in conjunction with my Samsung S3 phone
While the sound quality was excellent when it worked, rotating the plug while it was in the phone resulted in either hearing some static or the sound cutting out entirely
It was sufficiently sensitive to this that I can not listen to a single song using these earbuds while walking with my phone in my pocket
Potentially, this problem might only apply to my particular model of phone
A small length of the metal on the audio plug was still visible, even after being fully inserted into the phone, so perhaps the plug simply happened to be too long for my phone
Whatever the cause, I could not use these earbuds
I used these earbuds while prepping in the kitchen
I bought them because they came with a button on the wire to pause my music
This proves to be very helpful when my manager is trying to grab my attention while I'm in the middle of listening my books
I also liked that they came with a clip, so I could attach them to my chef jacket without worrying about them flopping around
They worked fine for the first two days, but then suddenly the right ear bud stopped working
Amazon is shipping me a replacement pair
Hopefully they last a bit longer
I am a choosy person and these buds just kill it
These buds punch above their weight in sound quality for the price and are well designed in every other way as well
Can't go wrong with these
The sound in these headphones are amazing
Deep bass and clear sound
Especially nice seal with the ear to cancel out any outside noise
Unfortunately they are very poor build quality
Of my three pairs, all were defective after 6 months
One ear bud stopped working in a matter of weeks
Also the warranty is spotty
I purchased from their site for my first ones, then got a replacement OK
Then my third pair I bought again from Amazon, attempted to claim warranty and it appears that my email was simply ignored
I'm now listening to one good ear bud and one that is full of crackling sounds
Buds were a surprise at how well the quality of the sound is, though compared to lower priced buds from JBL, sound quality is only marginally better
Also have J3 and sound quality is about the same
Great buds for the money
Nice base and the 3 different sized covers was nice
I would buy these again
These headphones are great, I use them all the time
Good sound, nice fit, fairly good at reducing ambient sound
This is my second pair of JLAB headphones, I was more than happy to buy the second pair after the first wore out
I would definitely buy these again and recommend them to anyone
They also come in fun colors, I've gotten several compliments on that alone
I thought the earbuds were great, but had to return them, since they didn't fit my iPod
They would be great for anything BUT iPod, since Apple has only proprietary products and one can ONLY use Apple in an iPod
The cat ate my daughter other ear buds and she loves these more then those
She loves the sound
Luv them, the color, they are sturdy and easy to carry
I like to put behind my neck
The sound is so great even when I turn the volume low quality of still awesome
I like these a lot because they are fairly durable and a reasonable price
Pick them up when they're on sale and they're perfect for a set of spares for work or the gym
The low pitch is doing very well, but the definition is not good, but when the movement there will be noise, I did not use it
These headphones are great
The sound quality is good, the mic works well
They're loud when they need to beMinus one star  because they don't stay in my ears as well as my last headphones do
Even after adjusting the buds
The left earbud started to emit a buzzing noise three days after I started using them
The sound quality of these buds is decent
The weight of the buds also makes them prone to falling out of your ears
JLab earbuds are simply the best
I use them with my Android phone, my Ipad2, and with my PC
You can hear the entire sound range from the lows, mids, and highs very clearly
The cord thickness is outstanding, you can feel the quality
And the offset connector with the reinforced rubber grip is outstanding as well
There's no need to be extravagant or waste money and buy $100
00 ear buds
JLabs gives you outstanding sound quality and durability at an affordable price
And if you take care of them and don't abuse them, you won't have any problems
Again, the bass is heavier than I like but quality is not bad
However, the right earbud stopped working after a month and a half
Fortunately, JLab has an awesome, awesome customer support and after I proved the purchase order/date, they replaced within a week
For $17 (price @ this time), it is definitely worth trying out and listening to
I have ordered these on three different occasions
No I was not unhappy at all; rather I just gave them to all my grandkids and they are still using them and never had any problem with them at all
Excellent sound reproduction and excellent value
You can buy much more an expensive item, but these work very well and we have had no issues at all with them
I will buy them again if I need to
Great Product
I am hard of hearing
With the JBuds and my Kindle Fire HD I can understand almost every thing the first time I here it
What a great surprise that is
The sound is much better than any of the stock earphones/earbuds I've had
So listening to music with these is a joy
The mic though was disappointing
I've done some video chats with them, and the volume level that the mic picks up is lower than average, much inferior compared to the ThinkPad earbuds (Lenovo ThinkPad Headphones Mini Phone 57Y4488
The left speaker started cutting out the 3rd time I used them
and completely broke during that use
They look physically fine, which leads me to believe they must use some shoddy internal wiring
Absolutely ridiculous they would break these easily after only a few light uses
Headphones were never transported or coiled up
simply left them on my desk in between the few times I used them
Buyer beware
Avoid this company
Update: 7/15/14These ear buds are still going strong
They get used several times a week for trips to the gym and just sitting at my desk listening to music
I would definitely recommend these to anyone who's looking for quality ear buds on a budget
This is the third JLabs product I've purchased and I will admit, I am a big fan of their products
I purchased the J5's because they dropped in price to around $16 and I decided to give them a try
I had been using the J3's for several months and I wanted to upgrade due to price, not necessity
I still use the J3's with my iPad, but that's a separate review
I really like the J5's
The sound coming out of these $16 ear buds is absolutely incredible
I was really happy with the J3's, but to me, the J5's are in a class all their own
I am no audiophile, but for the first time, I've heard small details in music I've heard for years, from a background guitar track to richer harmonies in vocals
It's hard to explain, but to me, it's like watching one of your favorite movies on Blu-Ray for the first time
You notice the sharpness and clarity more than ever before
I listen to a lot of different types of music, and everything sounds fantastic, even those older CD's that haven't been re-mastered since their initial release
If you're in the market for an excellent pair of ear buds and don't want to spend an insane amount of money on them, then the J5's are for you
I highly recommend these to anyone
These are just exactly as advertised
The bass and treble make for great sounds
They block out loud noise better than I expected
The price is phenomenal
I could not wait to get my Jbuds J5M, heard so much about them and was in dyer need of new ear-buds headphones
First thing I did when I got them is pull out my previous headsets and plug my Jbuds in and oopps
where's the great sound, where's the great sound and quality, perhaps I have the wrong ear plugs, tried the large ones, better but now when I move around, the cord hitting on my chest or collar creates a "thump" every time, something I did not feel with my previous headsets
I listened to it all the way home and put them back in the package they came in and went back to my old set
Good thing they were on special, not a big loss but but a big disappointment
These earbuds only worked for one day
Then of them shorted out
So if not for them shorting out they probably would be some good earbuds
Great sound, awesome price, microphone works great, durable when riding my motorcycle at speeds well above the speed limit
Highly recommend
I have three
The sound is amazing and the buds feel great in my ears
They are strong and flexible without being cumbersome
This is my go-to headphone
The music quality is good and it serves well as a headset for the telephone and doesn't eat power like a bluetooth set
Inexpensive and reliable
This is my second pair of J5s and bought them again because the sound was superior with my first pair
Durability was an issue though, the first barely lasted just over a year
This second pair has been really disappointing
I put them in and was excited to listen to Pretty Lights and all these other trap artists, and it was like, huhhh
Something was missing
Clearly not the same quality as the one I had before at all, major disappointment
Bass isn't punchy at all, it is probably just as bad as the earphones that came with my Android phone, an afterthought
I'm gonna find another pair :(
These work ok
The person I bought  them for does not like the feel of the buds in his ear
He wishes that they were more like the Apple earbuds
Most earbuds are the ear-canal type
Why are these popular
They are uncomfortable and the quality of sound is not good
I am not upset, just disappointed
One earbud is non-functional
Seems like a loose connection
The item was never exposed to any abuse
Maybe it was a lemon
I'm improving my rating on this item due to the good customer support from the manufacturer
I contacted JLabs and they are sending me another unit no questions asked, no return required which is nice since I'm in Venezuela
I'm surprised that the earbuds are still working after many months
I'm used to the earbuds losing sound over time, but my J5M still function really well
I love the thick wires and the L-shaped jack
I would definitely buy these again if mine stop working
I previously owned some $100 Etymotic Research earbuds but those just stopped working after 6 months
I think the J5M have much more value at $25 (when I purchased)
The sound quality is good (note: I am not an audiophile)
It isn't noise-cancelling or noise-isolating, but one of their included tips fit well enough into my ear that it muffled most sounds
I can definitely listen to music on a loud subway train without maxing the volume
I also noticed that I do not hear the usual static sounds when I walk with these headphones on
I dont have any cons
I love them
Pros are nice ausio quality, nice surrounds sound, nice bass, and great mic too
I bought these in another color
great product
I get this set and it shorts out in both of my MP3 players and is generally a piece of garbage
They aren't even made the same
Why would you sell two different products for the same price and under the same label if they are different or different versions
Amazon really dropped the ball on this one
Was looking for earbuds I could wear while sleeping (next to the loudest snorer in the world)
These fit the bill
They come with a variety of silicone pads, and I chose the smallest size for my tiny ear openings
They are relatively comfortable while sleeping, and stay in pretty well (I do need to re-adjust them from time to time)
Sound quality is pretty good
I would say these would also work well for active exercise use
Not sure how they do at sound BLOCKING, since I play a snore-sound-cancelling program on these
I usually get the j2 but these are worth the extra cost
Sound is great, nice color, they are durable
I have been a fan of JLab earbuds for a while, but this one seems to indicate defective manufacturing
I like using them on planes due to the passive noise cancellation from the ear pads, but on a 20hour flight that I specifically bought hear for two weeks ago, the metal tip at the end of the plug busted off in the jack located at my seat
I had used them for less than one hour
Very unhappy with this as this was a brand I had used for the last few years
Sound quality is fantastic
Stylish and sleek, but reliability can be improved
Be careful folding the wires- sound in one headphone can disappear after consistent wear and tear
The right channel quit working
It was working fine until yesterday then it just stopped
I know its not the device because I tried another headphone
I got these because I wanted to replace my Bluetooth headset with a simple wired mic
These worked fine, until one of the buds stopped working within less than a month
I also found the rubber inserts not well-sized for my ears: the medium ones were too small, and the large too big
Very good quality, and a great price
And there are a number of color choices
I have used JLab ear buds for several years
They won't disappoint
I've been an audio fan for a VERY long time, and over the years I've auditioned a lot of speakers and headphones
I like a NATURAL bass sound, tight and full and percussive (as a former bass/electric bass/tuba player, I know first-hand what that sounds like), and a sliky, smooth treble with space or air around the instruments
Headphones can't deliver the full bass sound because they can't recreate the chest impact, which is why so many headphone listeners like exaggerated bass
They can, however, deliver a startling soundstage and in-your-head presence that is almost instantly addictive
While these phones are well-made and comfortable, they fail on almost every other criteria
Bass is rolled off nearly to nonexistence
Treble is rough and screechy, and mids have a hard, steely quality
Altogether a VERY bad experience; they were packed up and sent back a day later after two listening sessions
If you need IEMs, go with the Sound Magic E10, otherwise the Koss KSC-75 is the way to go in this price range
While the sound, color, and microphone are great, they are not worth the money because they do not last
I purchased these in January and one ear bud died a week or two ago
As i was walking to work today, the second side stopped working
For $25, I expected them to last longer than 5 or 6 months
These earbuds are a great bargain at the price they're selling for
Sound quality is as good as models selling for triple the price
I've only had them for less than a month, so I can't comment on the durability
But all earbuds need to be treated with a little care because of the thin wires
Most people will be quite happy with how they sound out of the box
They are a little heavy on the bass so a little equalization gives them pretty much perfect sound
And the four different sizes of ear cushions make them easy to fit comfortably
Very highly recommended
Buy two pair so you'll have a spare, and then you'll qualify for free shipping
This is one of those products that I love enough to buy a spare of
While I'm not an audio genius, I find the sound quality excellent -- best I've found under $100
The mic also makes my fiancee happier than other pairs I've tried
Now're days they've gotten as cheap as crap sounding earbuds out of walmart but these are great for my needs
I generally rely on VoIP, music, and video playback via Android
I've been using these since February 2012 and it's still going strong, durability has been nice
Cable noise doesn't seem to impair use while rolling in bed or laying on it
Also they've not fallen apart despite excessive use -- I'm a really, really happy camper
for the price these serve the purpose
sturdy and listenable
the different size rubber buds give a proper fit in the ear
The sound is good
The online manual is unreadable as the type is so small and it is a pdf
They arrived on time
They are wonderful
Clear sound,  noise canceling,  and best of all,  5 different sizes of comfy ear buds
Very comfortable
Will be buying another set for hubby 's IPAD
When they worked, they performed very nicely
Unfortunately they seem to suffer from build quality issues
The initial pair I received failed within two weeks of receipt
The replacement pair lasted a little longer - about three weeks - but failed in a similar way
I'm hoping that the replacement for the replacement will be good
but I'm not holding out much hope
[Update - Oct 28th, 2013] Well, as I suspected the replacement failed too
To my surprise JLab customer support then offered me a replacement pair of an alternate product (the J4M earbuds) which lasted significantly longer than any or the J5M's had, but still failed much sooner than I would have expected (yesterday, to be specific, which based on the original review date of August 7th suggests the J4M's can have lasted no longer than 11 weeks)
Based on my experience, I'm not going to be giving JLab any more of my money in the future unless I see a significant increase in their customer satisfaction ratings
Great buy and are satisfactory for me, a hard of hearing person
I only use one of the two, but find the clarity excellent
I do find the long cord a bit difficult to handle with a kindle sitting in my lap on on a nearby table
These are comfortable, sound great, are inexpensive and are backed by incredible customer service
If they break, they replace them if a warranty issue and give you a 50% discount if you just drop them in water or such
The sound quality, base response is excellent for such small plugs, very comfortable
Have suggested to friends who have also purchased some
This is good
Voice is very clear
Wire is little bit thin but quality of sound is very good
If anyone looking for reasonable headphones then go for it
Appears to be a good product; does well what it is supposed to do
A small storage sleave, as others have suggested, would have nice to include
These headphones are not 65 dollar quality
They're marked up so you think your getting a great discount on a high value product
The sound quality is poor, my cheap 14
99 jvc's had better sound quality with a deeper bass sound
My first pair broke within 2 weeks of use
The left head phone went out
I got a replacement and alas, the second pair broke but this time it lasted 4 weeks
Sadly when the new headphones broke I was out of the country and unable to return them
So now they're just really nice ear plugs for when I sleep
Skip these headphones, they're being sold to make quick money, not a quality product
Was excited to use it since I've had one before
Got to the gym and was ready to work out until I couldn't hear anything
Come to find out this one was a bad one
I have small ears, and the Apple headphones I tried to use with my iPhone/iPad either fell out constantly or just hurt
These are nice, comfortable, and sleek
They also have great sound quality for music or watching videos on the iPad
Nice price too
Very happy with the purchase
Symptom: one of the ear bud went dead within one year of mild usage
Usage pattern: I mainly use this product for listening to music either in office or on subway
The earphone nicely cancels the ambient noise
That's why I think it deserves 2 stars
I also use it while walking to the subway station with it plugged into my iphone, but I do not use it when running or doing other types of exercise
So I consider my usage pattern as mild
Pro: sound quality is good
Nice for indoor listening
Con: it got broken too fast
It is not strong enough for listening while walking, and it is definitely not strong enough for listening while exercising
I am really hard on my earbuds
I use them nearly every day, and can go through a cheap pair in a few weeks
I was a little disappointed by the lack of volume controls
However, I have noticed that I usually don't change the volume more then one click up or down, and that is only when going from a quiet area to a noisy area, I
E
running the vacuum
I use these with my iPhone 4 mostly for podcasts, audio books and phone calls
The only trouble that I have had so far is the wire mesh covering the speaker came off while I was cleaning it
I bought these to have something solid and inexpensive to wear to the gym
They worked ok for a few weeks, and then the right earbud simply stopped working
Naturally, they broke literally one day after the return window had expired
Moreover, the earbuds didn't even sound that great to begin with--music was thin, tinny, and light on the bass
Don't buy this crap; save your money and get something a bit more expensive and higher quality
Compared to standard phone supplied earbuds these provide outstanding sound quality
Wear them in the gym while plodding on the treadmill
With my old earbuds I could hear all the usual gym background noise even with the volume cranked to max
With these, mimimal background noise, good sound quality at a low volume setting
Very comfortable in my ears as well
These headphones have decent sound and are attractive, but lasted exactly the length of the warranty and (literally) started to come apart at the seams
I first noticed problems with the microphone and ipod controls about 6 months in
The product became useless after about 13 months, when the headphones stopped producing any sound at all -- probably due to the seal and joints holding the cable to the plug coming apart
If the price is worth a year of use to you, by all means pull the trigger
If you are looking for something more long term, I'd look elsewhere
***UPDATE***The very same day I posted this review, I received a reply to the review from JLab
They assured me that the product was defective and this was the exception, not the rule
They then directed me to the customer support page on their website and it was all too easy to make a claim and receive a replacement set of these defective headphones, even outside of the warranty period
So, although I am pleased with the reasonable customer service of this company, I will revisit my rating of the product only once I have had an opportunity to see if the set I had was one of just a few defective products, or the manufacturing quality on this model simply isn't up to par
***LAST UPDATE***After having these replaced, they have once again suffered the same fate of the first Jlab J5M headphones
At 3 months, the casing from the microphone assembly came undone, leaving part of the assembly to slide up and down the wire
Then, after about 6 months of use, the wire that connects the plug to my iPhone has stopped working properly
If the wire isn't positioned perfectly, the sound stops entirely, requiring random jiggling of the cable to get any sound whatsoever
Very annoying when you're trying to work out
Despite assurances that these defects are the exception to the rule, I am forced to conclude to the contrary
Not saying don't buy them--the price is right, the sound is decent and they fit nicely in the ear--just do so with the awareness that this product is not built to last
I used to own Jbuds before and they sounded alot better then these
I already had to send 1 pair back and hope I don't have another issue
Unfortunately, the cats love to destroy these so I've purchased several replacements for my daughter, but these are our first choice
They work beautifully to drown out noise like: crap music at the gym, loud spousal snoring, engine noise when flying
They are also comfortable and offer various sized ear buds
I like the sound from Jbuds - I don't need amazing sound - just good - since I listen to audiobooks with them
My problem with these and other Jbuds I have purchased is their apparent fragility
I am not that hard on these things but they have all quit working on one side
In the future I will spend less and feel better when I have to toss them
These are not as durable as they say
For the price be prepared to buy more on a regular basis
I have used them for the phone
one side stopped working
these earbuds are comfortable to the ear and very clear sound
we can use them whenever we need to be quiet(r) at bedtime or if someone else wants to read in the quiet of the room
Great deal and excellent product for the price
They never tangle up, and the color makes it easy to fiind
ordered these based off of other reviews comparing them to skullcandy and other comparable brands,,, this is a out and out lie
first off sound quality is no where near as good as skull
second within days i was getting distortion through the earbuds and static feedback when they were on
the design is okay but nothing to write home about
cable is a little too short for my taste as well
all in all i would not recommend
i have owned dozens of earbuds and found some ingenious ways to damage them and these have betrayed me without much provocation
hell ive had sets of earbuds i have washed in a laundromat and turn around and work just fine (skullcandies flat wire no mic)
i hardly write reviews because i dont see the need unless its a scam
The price was right and the quality far exceeds what I thought
I use them for my cell phone calls and just for listenening to music
Great sound and very well made
I use this headset to go to the gym everyday
After only one month, the jack that goes into the phone and the wire that runs to the earpieces started to come apart
I buy headphones about once a year to once a year and a half based on wear and tear
But these did not hold up to what I consider normal wear and tear
I don't recommend them
(Sound is great when it was playing
)
I rated these five stars because these are the heavy duty earbuds that my thirteen year old cant destroy in a week
If you use it in your room without moving and you like good base, you will like it
But,- If you move, the sound of the cord touching your cloth will be annoying
- If wind blows, the sound of wind will be annoying
I never expected these issues
However, the sound quality is good except that the voice sound is not big enough while base sound is big
I've had these now for a little over a year and primarily use them when I'm riding my bike to/from places (5-10 mile trips)
I had gone through about 4 or 5 of the cheapo $5 or $10 sets in the past few months so decided to try something a little more expensive and see if it lasted any longer
To my surprise, these earbuds are still going strong
They have been yanked/pulled on or pulled out of my ears a handful of times and still work perfectly
They also sound very good
They were about $30 when I bought them, but I see they've not only come down in price, but now have a large variety of different colors available
Well, at least I know where to turn when I eventually need new ones, which I doubt will be any time soon
If you need some nice earbuds, you can't go wrong with these
I bought these earbuds to replace the skullcandy ones I owned previously because one side stopped working
I am pleased with how these ones feel and sound, although I must complain about one thing
I noticed that the sound "clicks" every once in a while, so since it's not perfect, I took off one star
It doesn't happen often and it's random
The microphone also works nicely with my droid bionic when I'm on a call
Over all, I think it was a good buy
These headphones arrived with one channel not working
Additionally, for the one channel that did work, the right ear, the sound came through tinny and with poor clarity
I have owned several pairs of JBuds ear-bud headphones in the past and have never been satisfied with them
I would recommend those interested in these headphones to look at comparable Sony headphones as I have found them to be much more satisfactory
I received these quickly and thy are great replacing my original earbuds that came with my iphone
They stay in place is why I purchased them
Soft silicone extra size pieces fit the ear buds to adjust to your ears
High quality sound
Built in Mic is a plus
I purchased these headphones a few mos
Odd them no more than 3 or 4x
Never ruff treatment
In fact
Very carefully baby'd
I've worked on the strereo business many many years
Broke them in properly as well
Well take a guess
right side where Mic is
No warning
Gone
Another 50$
I want my money back
This earbuds are the best pair I've ever owned in my music life
They work really well
The last two products I had were JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds (Black) and JBuds J3M Micro Atomic In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Mic (Electric Blue)
However, I had to ask for product replacement at least once for those products
I gave away original JBuds as soon as I got JBuds J3M, but JBuds J3M is once again broken even after the replacement
I used to fold around my headphones when I want to store it in my pocket
Well, there's a better way
Instead of folding the wire around your mobile phone or MP3 player, try coiling them around your hand in circles like the way you received the product
It's pretty neat that way
I have experienced a few fault with the previous earbuds I owned
Some of you out there might have as well
I recommend you to leave enough free space around the plug area if you want to wrap it around your device without unplugging the earbuds
Keeping the plug overly banded is the root of the failure of earbuds
I purchased this product back in February of 2013 and thought that it would at least last me a year
However, it is now the end of May 2013 and these headphones no longer work
If you want headphones to last you more than 3 months I would strongly recommend not purchasing this item
What a waste of money
Work great - very happy that if came with other but sizes
Priced great and does what I need it to do
What I said in the title really, first happened after only a few days of using the product, no obvious reason
Sound quality good though
Really comfortable, bought a case really cheap and good
Sound is perfect, great to wear them when working out outside, gardening, etc
Good deal
My grandson loved the ear buds and said they had the sound he was looking for while snowmobiling
They were perfect under his helmet
I decided to pick these up going off the majority of reviews being positive
However, I'm left with not being able to use them
The earbuds came with a couple of different sizes which doesnt even matter
These are close to impossible to keep from falling out of your ear
In fact the left one is so well rooted in I haven't been able to remove it for a week
Actually seriously these are my favorite head phones and they sound good and are tough
They continue to work well even after exposure to lots of sweat and occasional though accidental abuse
Sound stopped coming out of right ear after one week of use
very disappointed
Possibly the worst $20 I have ever spent
I will not be granting this company my business in the future and I will be warning my friends from using JBuds
These earbuds are comforatble
Your don't even know you are wearing
The sound quality is great and they are holding up well
The quality felt good and solid
I was a little worried about thin cords compared to my J4 earbuds but they lasted
I eventually lost mine but they worked well until then, The button was great for changing songs and the microphone also worked well
5 stars if they didnt lack comfort
They fell out of my ears unless I really pushed them in, and when I did that the solid chasis would rub on my ear causing pain if using for long peroids of time
When I was at the gym I guess I didn't notice the pain because I ran with these a bit and it didn't seem to bother me then
These earbuds very comfortable and they block the room noise very well
Plus, I love the color
I'm very pleased with my purchase
Do you think you know all the way that earbuds can be used
I've found that they are the best way to block my husband's (wife's) snoring
I have longer periods of sleep (up to 5 hours) when I am using my earbuds
My wife uses  the JBuds to play movies on her Kindle Fire HD and goes into uninterrupted  coma and enjoying her Amazon Prime subscription to watch one of the hundreds of thousands of titles available
I'm ever so happy that she enjoys her birthday present
Happy wife , Happy life
The first time I bought this pair of J5 blue ear buds with mic, the left earbud failed after 1 week of usage
In addition, the ear buds weren't even labeled correctly
Left and right were completely flipped
In addition, the microphone is terribly bad at picking up sound,  I end up having to pick up the mic piece and placing it about an inch from my mouth for anyone to actually hear me clearly
After receiving the replacement earbuds from amazon, the issues with the low sensitivity mic and flipped left and right buds were still present
However, once again, the left channel crapped out after only a dozen or so uses
I have never dropped them and store them carefully
What a waste of money and time, I will never buy from this brand again
As a third party headphone for Apple they worked well and they survived  through my everyday use
The only problem I ha was the button control
Overall it worked but nothing can beat the original
But
JBuds does come close
these earbuds are some of the best quality I have purchased and I have bought many get them when you can
I ordered these thinking that they were going to be perfect but I got the opposite
There was an issue with them and when I tried to obtain the warranty, it seemed to be too easy
With no phone calls or messages I was able to get a replacement set of headphones
This makes me wonder weather they are as good as they say they are
And by the way, when i received the other headphones, they were not the correct ones, which did make me a bit upset but they did work better then the other pair i got
Sturdy, well made, reinforced connections, and excellent sound quality (highs, mid-range, and great bass in addition to rendering excellent stereo separation)
Short story: Met a friend and his hyper collie while walking my lab
His beautiful dog jumped up on me (not a problem really) to lick me, but I was wearing these ear buds
His paw caught the buds right at the separation point for right and left (a reinforced point) from the main feed cable and violently snatched them from my ears with an audible SNAP whereupon they hit the ground and he stepped on them
Retrieving them I found not one scratch, no damage to cabling due to the reinforcement and no loss of sound quality
Amazing in my book
Only one nit, it would be nice to have a volume control on the right line as well as the mute button provided
This pair of earbuds is the best I've owned
They are comfortable and I can enjoy the sound much better than the others
I am a grandmother that has trouble hearing in one of my ears and this set of earbuds is the best for it
As always, excellent service from Amazon and an amazing product
I haven't had a chance to use it so far
I am sure it will be as useful as all the items I bought from Amazon
Thanks
Bottom line:  No matter which size earbud bad I installed it would not fit inside my ear
something is not right with the design
These are very good earphones for working out or listening while doing housework
Good price & I would recommend to friends
This item was a gift so I can't really say
The teenage girl likes purple and I see her use them so they must work alright
Since the first day I received this headphones I loved them
The sound is amazing and clarity of the voice on the integrated microphone in my Samsung Galaxy S3 is perfect
This headphones are way much better than Samsung original headset that comes with the S3
Totally recommended if you want to have a great audio experience and great voice quality calls
Bought this for my wife to replace a single headphone from JLAB that died after a year or so of use
She reports that it is good, and sounds good when I am on a call with her
She has pretty small ears and the smallest adapter fits her ear perfectly
Her only complaint is that the cord is too long for her liking
We've used these before and they have always performed wonderfully,  Trouble is, the dog eats them which is why we have to buy the case separately
Wish the case came with it as it becomes expensive
I typically don't review products unless something stands out
My earbuds broke, I submitted a photo and description via their website, quick, courteous response, new earbuds in 4 days
The quality of switching back to these earbuds was a nice surprise all over again, especially for the price the first time, not to mention the second pair being free(within 1 year)
The J5 Earbuds has good soundI like the color of the itemI already told some of my  friends about it
The styling and build quality of the set are fairly good overall
The sound is great, You should know I am hearing impaired and these work great for me by letting me crank it up without loosing the quality
Great buy
One of the buds barely has any sound
I tried them with my iPhone 4, Kindle and Mac -- and they do not give the sound quality I read about in the reviews
My mom mailed these to me because I live in Europe
It's too much hassel to return them :~/ They are useless to me
I love JLabs earbuds, but they are really fragile
Less than a year of average use usually brings a breakage of the connection to one or the other of the ears
I sure wish they'd fix this, figure out how to make them more robust
I found myself at work one day without headphones and lucked out to find these bad boys for $14
50 (maybe because I ordered the black/electric blue ones
at the time i think the other colors were ~$25)
I was a little skeptical of headphones that were such a steal AND included a mic so I ordered the JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs (don't even bother with this piece of
) at the same time, which had a higher rating that the JBuds
The JBuds hands down beat out the JVC headphones in every category - sound, quality, appearance, comfort, and cool factor
When I'm at home, I continuing using these headphones and have completely forgotten about my $300 Bose headphones (probably because Bose tickles my neck if any hair is caught in them)
Only suggestion for improvement would be to include volume control along with the mic (and I'm sure they have a more expensive model that already has this)
Would definitely buy again
I had a set of J2 earbuds for a couple of years and liked them so much that when they were destroyed I skipped over every other vendor and went looking in JLab's product book for a replacement
I'm very happy with the J5M
It's a better set than the J2 in every way: smaller, better looking, more comfortable, and (most important, obviously) much better sounding
In addition to producing a richer sound, they also do a better job of sealing out external noise
I'm not a sound engineer but I'm guessing the improved noise-exclusion is because the smaller earbuds fit better and the rubber adapters (four different sizes come with the earbuds) are made of a heavier material
I can't say I particularly needed the microphone; I chose the J5M because the set was (oddly, to my mind) a dollar cheaper than the microphone-less J5
I do have various iOS devices and can confirm that the mic and control button work as advertised on these devices
The control button also works properly to control iTunes on my MacBook Pro, which I think is neat even if I can't really imagine why anyone would want to do it
Final verdict: to my ear this is a nearly perfect product
When they're inevitably destroyed in a couple of years (I break things; I'm at peace with it), I'll be looking to JLab's product book again
Look really good for the price
but
The in line mic broke and there are now pieces that "float" up and down the cable
These were the one's I decided to "upgrade" to after trying the Jlab J3M (which broke within the return window)
Sadly, this will have to be the last purchase for JLab headphones for me
I know I'm not paying for a premium product here, but seriously the quality of these are just not holding up
Side note, these are the first headphones I've ever owned that conduct static shocks directly into your ears
I've used these on multiple flights and even the slightest movement will send repeated shocks into your ear holes
Very exciting on 12-14 hour flights
:/
Make sure to take full advantage of JLab's 1-year no-questions warranty
I've been through about 4 replacements of various models of their headphones
It's almost like I don't mind paying ~$30 for more or less decent headphones, but the trouble of replacing them got to me so I got some nicer ones
Love these but wish the cord was longer so I could move around my desk
Guess I will just have to get an extension for them
Or get an ipod
There are definitely some Pros and Cons with this product
For me, aside from price point, most important was the sonic performance of the earbuds
In this regard, the J5Ms met my expectation
I found them to be at least as good as the Apple earbuds, with a bit more definition or "clarity" in the mid-range to upper frequencies
Some might consider them to be "bright" sounding, but when I'm riding my bike in traffic, I can still hear the music and enough ambient noise to know what's going on around me
I have no gripes with regard to construction
They seem adequate in this regard; they are lightweight, fit comfortably in my ears, and for workouts, I'm not concerned with hearing ambient noise
I prefer my Apple earbuds most of the time because they do allow a lot of ambient noise to pass into the ears
However, my biggest gripe with the J5Ms is the design of the control for my iPhone
It's only on and off without a volume control and the the little "stick" they used is not at all well thought out like Apple's, which because of the shape, you can "feel" between your fingers with a nicely sized and elongated button
Even the button Apple employs has a soft texture to it
Not so here, I find myself groping for the the little button on this "dumb" cylindrical thing
But, for the price, they're just okay
If I had to replace them today, I'd try a different product
Sound was good but  kept falling out of my ear
Bought the ear hooks  but they didn't fit that great
The Mic button worked on and off
Enjoy having sound everywhere I go with my Kindle Fire, also being able to read or watch in the dark or sunlight
This is my second pair of JBuds Earbuds (the first was the J3 model)
I experienced the same problem with both sets - the speaker and rubber insert separates from the housing
When this happens you can no longer keep the earphones in your ear
With the J3s it took about two weeks, with the J5s it took less than 1 minute
Perhaps JBuds should add some super glue to the joint before sending these out the door
When I insert the earbuds in my ear I give them a slight twist to get a good seal
It's possible that's the problem, but my earbuds from other manufacturers (Scosche, Samsung, Sennheiser) have not had this separation problem (now if only I could stop losing them
)Sound is reasonable, not great, but poor quality make these way overpriced
The earbuds seem well equipped but none of the plastic ear pieces fit correctly
The plastic is not soft enough where they can conform to the shape of the ear so they tend to pop out easily
If I choose the smallest piece the audio and bass is severely degraded and my player sounds like i'm listening to a cheap transistor radio
The mid to large pieces, if i push hard on them into my ear, bass and audio comes out great, but if i walk or tilt my head, they pop right out
Sometimes it feels I'm spending more time adjusting them than enjoying the audio
I got these because I needed the MIC feature, but I have to say, Sony's so far have had the best quality in my experience
If you dont plan to move much and just do some casual listening, these are great
For anything active, I don't recommend them
This is my second pair of JBuds
I have a pair at home that I use when working in the yard
I highly recommend this headphones
The only thing I don't like about these headphones is the lack of volume control
It has a stop and play button but you have to use the phone to adjust volume
Other than that, these are comfortable and I love them
If you have a life proof case on the phone you'll need the adapter
Sound is amazing and great when using with my Droid Razr HD
However if you plug them in just right or if the plug turns just right they stop working
Have tried with my desktop headphone jack, also the same result
Not sure whats wrong but they feel solid sound amazing when they work
They kept breaking at the metal insert part
We did get a free pair because they broke but then a few weeks later those broke too
They had good sound and blocked out a lot of other sound, but it was like having a stethoscope on whenever you wore them
You could hear your self breathe and if you didn't use the clip, every time the wire bounce against your shirt, it sounded like someone was snapping you earbuds with a pencil, kind of annoying
Not really worth the money
The right ear quit working after only a few uses and are probably in a landfill at this moment
Like many cat owners, I had to replace mine after my cat tore it apart
I was looking for possibly better headphones for a little more money that would resemble the sound quality in the J4s
Though these are way more comfortable than the J4s, I would argue that J4s sound noticably nicer
However, in terms of comfort, the J4s were terrible at times
The J5s sound clear nonetheless, and very comfortable, not to mention lightweight
I bought these in February after having a generally positive experience with previous generation JBuds
The product stopped working properly (the sound in the left earbud was diminished) after only a few weeks and I went through the warranty replacement process which, to JLAB's credit, is very easy and efficient
The build quality, packaging, accessories, and overall feel are all great but when the sound stops working, it's hard to leave a good review
Unfortunately, the replacement I received lasted for even less time than my original pair
The left earbud once again has diminished sound and this time it happened after a mere 3 days of casual use
I am in the process of filing another claim but this seems to be a reoccurring problem so I would advise you to do your research before purchasing a pair
FOR CHEAP SET THEY ARE OK IF NOT RUNNINGWILL LOOK FOR BEHIND THE EAR SET NEXTI DO LIKE THE PLUG END VERY STABLE
I purchased this headset to use with my iPhone 4S
The reviews were average, so I knew going in this wasn't going to be a stellar buy
Well, there's nothing like starting with low expectations, and being disappointed even further
These headphones look fine, but the sound quality is really bad
which defeats the entire purpose for getting these
The sound coming through these headphones is all muddled, not crisp at all
I tried these in different environments (inside, outside, noisy), but the sound quality was subpar regardless
It's been more than 30 days, so hoping Amazon will issue me a partial refund for this purchase
Disappointed
I've been a fan of Jlab's products for quite some time because the quality sound provided at a reasonable price
I needed to replace my J3's after about 16 months of heavy use (6-9 hours a day 5 days a week) due to one earbud's sound cutting in and out
I decided to get the J5's due to the (mostly) positive reviews, I disregarded the reviews claiming poor build quality due to my own positive experiences with the company's products
Initially I loved them; the quality of the sound and fit were superior, after about 4 hours the left earbud started cutting in and out
During the first 4 hours they were used while sitting at my desk, so I  wasn't putting them through any rigorous or harsh usage
I have to admit I am disappointed, I have recommended JLab's products to family, friends and co-workers I may have to reconsider doing that in the future
The quality of sound, bass and treble was very good and distinct
However, when I used them at the gym, they do not stay well in my ears and come out of them quite often
The sound is loud and clear
Just the way i like it
And come in various cap sizes (I used the smaller ones instead of the default ones - and they fit nicely)
they keep falling outa my ear, these are definitely not made for workouts and hiking, they dont stay in your eat at all even with the right size plugs
When my sister's pug chewed my first pair decided that a second set was in order
Very comfortable; my Father much preferred these when on a recent airline flight, and sound quality is also good
I bought this from Amazon
Sound is good but hardware is bad
Just after a months use, i started having problem
The voice started breaking and come to find out that the cord came loose from the jack
Not very sturdy especially you are using going to use this in the gym or while running
These headphones put out solid sound, with a good range
For the price, I think the sound quality is great
I use these to run in and it makes me experience that much better
I've had some more high profile/high priced, ear buds in the past, and they were slightly better, but for the price, these are good
These earbuds were provided to me free of charge by Amazon because my original earbuds (HTC Stereo Headset for HTC EVO 4G (Black)) would often not register when plugged into my new Kindle Fire HD
It's fortunate that they were free, because at $30 I would not have even thought of them as an option
I work in a general store which sells similar earbuds for $5
They use the same style of rubber in-ear noise cancellers
I don't like these cheap peices of rubber, because they need to fill your ear canal completely in order for the buds to stay in
Not only does this get uncomfortable after awhile, but it doesn't work for noise cancelling
Sure, you don't hear anything around you, but what you DO hear is every single movement the cord makes between your ears and whatever they're plugged into, and everything that's going on inside your own head (chewing food or gum for instance)
This is counter-intuitive at best
If you can get over this major disappointment, the sound quality is comparable to earbuds that you can get for half the price
If it weren't for the fact that they were the only headphones I owned that worked reliably in my Kindle Fire HD, I would never have used them
Now that I have Sony MDRZX100/BLK  ZX Series Stereo Headphones, these will likely go in the garbage
The only complaint is they color in the picture is alot darker then what was received
But that didn't bother me
High quality
sounds gratebut i use a equ with the bass up and dubstep
so ya one cut out
but i don't blame themwhat worry me is that the first jbuds could do it just fine and there only 5$ and sound about the same
people on the conference calls can here my typing really well so i have to mute
Audio quality is like headphones that come with iphone
build quality is fairly low but you get what you pay for
Good value
the J3s had a little band that slid up & down the wires above the split, to rein in the slack; it was very valuable when arranging beneath helmet and other gear
Also the sheathing is some sort of gripping rubber rather then the former slicker sheathing which didn't catch on every type of fabric
The sound remains superb
I bought these earphones after having a good experience with the J4 earbuds, and lost my J4's :'(Overall (after having these for a month) they don't quite match up to the J4's
I have to crank up the volume a few notches above what would be a comfortable volume with the J4's
They block out extra outside noise perfectly
Have above average bass, overall good sound quality (I listen to mostly metal, and some rap)
Can't complain really
Regular headphones to me
One small annoyance that I find is that if the cord hits against something you can hear it the headphones
This was the cause of a lot of bad reviews on the J4's but I personally did not come across that issue with the J4's
I would recommend them if you just want to buy something to listen to your music (they ARE better than your average $10/$15 headphones you can buy in the store quickly when you're on the go)
not nearly as good as the samsungs I already had no mute or vol control would not recommend to anyone
Great ear buds at a good price
We have had several sets, these are absolutely the best for the money
Good sound, built to last
There are better sets of earbuds, but none of them are anywhere near this price
The forged aluminum housings feel durable,  the bass is as powerful as in the J3, but the mids and highs are stable and clear, unlike the J3
Also, these headphones are not flashy enough to get stolen, nor do they make the user look like a chotch, as beats do
My gym plays the worst music that can really get in the way of my arc trainer and strength training rhythms
These headphone isolate external sounds (don't worry if someone says something you can hear them and, out of politeness take the buds out to chat
But you won't hear the annoying gym music bouncing off the walls and ceiling nor the loud voiced of those jokers over there pumping up to show each other how testosterone filled they are
Combine these earbuds with a workout music app on you iPod and you will reach your goal of giving your body the Victory V shape
(no i don't have it yet but i will)
As an aside, the apps are particularly good for cardio, helping to maintain a rhythm that can get you to push through those moments when you think you can't take it anymore and, if the app lets you change the beats per minute, adding to the difficulty,and ultimate benefit, of your routine
Word of advice: Even with the great sound and isolation of these earphones, don't overdo your routines
There have been times when the sound was so sublime i just didn't want to stop even then I'd reached the end of the time I had set
That has resulted in some very painful muscles, pre and post workout protein shakes notwithstanding
They must make a 500% profit margin on these cheaply made headphones that probably cost a few dollars to manufacture
Buyer beware, they don't sound good, or look nearly as good as their fancy website makes them appear
Being an audiophile, I can say the sound from these headphones is ridiculous
Your iPhone sounds better
Well after a great 6 month run the LEFT earbud just mysteriously stopped working It does not appear to be wire related as no ammount of wiggling the cord or compreesing it produced ANY sound from that side - Still overall I was happy enough with them to order the J
Fi
M buds from the same people - I'll be reviewing those as soon as I get them and try them out a while
ORIGINAL Review -Let me first say, I agonized way too long over which earbuds to buy
I own a set of Bose In Ear that I love, but the cords are starting to pull out of the ear pieces, and the in line switch piece broke off several months ago
So I wanted something that had the in-line mic/controls, that would sound nearly as good as the Bose, and that would be sturdy - Oh yea, 1 more thing
low budget, so a 2nd pair of the Bose was off the table from the start
the J5M's were a very pleasant surprise
quite reasonably priced - a VERY nice sound (tho still not as nice as the Bose) and several weeks of falling asleep while wearing them has not weakened them structurally as far as I can see
I liked everything, sound was good, looked perfect, but there was one problem
If I put ear buds little hard, ear buds would make Electric sound which is kind of scary
First pair: One ear was intermittently working right out of the box, until it went completely
At this price I expect better quality control
Update: They were under warranty and I was able to get a new pair sent within a few days
The new pair works and they sound great if you like a lot of bass
These sounds great but they always fall out of my ear within a few minutes while I'm running or working out and I've tried all the earpieces supplied
You have sports in the title so I thought these would stay in a little better
Might try a earpiece from a different set of earbuds
The sound is solid, little light on the bass but the mic/control comes in a handy especially if you have a smartphone with a touchscreen
You don't have to turn on the screen and unlock the phone to change tracks
Not recommended for running/working out
This is my second set of earbuds, my dog chewed up my old one
This model IS really nice, the sounds is awsome
They shock me occasionally
I'm not kidding about this, you actually get a mini shock sometimes while listening, it doesn't happen all of the time and it doesn't hurt, but it's enough to feel it
It's a weird non pleasant sensation
I don't listen to it very loud so I have no idea what this is, maybe some from of static electricity
who knows
I'm not an audiophile so I cannot speak about their sound quality too much apart from the fact that they sound good enough to me and they block out ambient noise which is good
**UPDATE**The shock is not the fault of the earbuds
Given this information and how pleased I am with the product, I'm updating to 4 stars
[
]
I have had this for almost a year and it still works as it did straight out of the box
For earbuds the sound quality and bass is great
I use this everyday and have been for neatly a year
It's also classy looking
no matter which ear bud covers i tried they kept falling out when i was walking on mill sound was good
2 stars might be a bit unfair as I use headphones connected to my phone that is in my front pocket while moving around alot
But the "design" of the angled jack was suppose to stop the huge issue most have about shorts making them cut out
They did last me about 2 months while the 5 dollar super cheap pairs last me a week or two
They do come with 4 ear bud sizes to get your preferred level of noise cancellation and they do have great sound so I will bump it up to  3 stars
I have decided to be finished with wired headphones and switch to bluetooth ones
I recommend a pair like LG Electronics HBS-700W Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset
I've gone through many different kinds of earbuds
These are the best
Look no further
These are comfortable and rugged
Right earpiece no longer works after two weeks of use
Extremely frustrated with my product because not only did I pay good money for this item, but I waited 2
5 weeks before it was shipped to me and now I have to replace it
I will not be purchasing from Jbuds again if they dont step up their quality control
This set of turd earbuds are lame
First off they dont sit in my ear well and are NOT comfortable
I tried using the different tips and none of them fit in my ear comfortably
AND then, this turd of a product BROKE after 3 weeks of minimal use
The right speaker broke and they sit at my work desk since new
This is cheap JUNK, they broke inside at my desk
Not running, not working out, not outside
INSIDE at my desk
Save your money, dont fall for the sale or ridiculous price
Update #1: Contacted by rep and friendly reminder about warrenty info
(adding a star and will update later)
Not any better that my Skull Candy Ink'd Mic'd, and I get those for $8-10 at a local TJ Maxx
Sound is not spectacular, cords get really coiled up (I admit I do roll them and store them in my pocket), and warranty is not as good as Skull Candy
I got turned onto these because of all the good reviews and sale price vs
MSRP, but these are not worth $56 as list price, and you would be an idiot to buy them at $35
I got them for $15, and they are really not worth more than $10 - not while http://www

This is my second pair of these headphones
The first pair were given to me by my girlfriend nearly 2 years ago
I used these things for hours every day for the gym, commuting to college via train, and at work
Most of these places are pretty loud but these headphones do a great job at sealing the external noise out
Mine finally broke because i got them caught one too many times on a piece of equipment at the gym so one bud stopped working
I had probably done that 100 times along with other stupid things that should have broken these headphones a long time ago
So the only reason mine are being replaced is because I was rough on them
I am sure these would last forever if you aren't rough with them like I am
They come with multiple sized ear pieces which is very convenient if you have i slightly different sized external auditory canals
They also come with a little clip to clip them to your shirt
I find that nice when you are running or moving around a lot
One thing that can be a problem is that the ear buds have a small metal ring around them which can be slightly painful if you get charged with static
If the charge gets big enough, it feels like someone threw a rock in your ear
This only happens to me because I process clothing at an athletic store causing me to have large amounts of exposure to it
For a normal situation it isn't too bad
Gym shorts/pants (depending on the material they are made from) may cause some static charging simply from having the audio device moving in your pocket
That's much less intense and doesn't bother me at all
That's literally the only downside to these headphones
Could not pass these up for the price and they work great
I wear them when I'm walking my dog on trails
Great quality
My daughter loves them
Then block out the background noise and she can focus on her task at hand and enjoy her music
GREAT buy
Also, the first set of buds she got were defective and I simply contacted Amazon, they sent the UPS return label and ship another set out overnight at no charge to me
I returned the others and all are happy
I absolutely love these headphones
They are one of the more better ones that I have owned
They are durable and have great bass to them
Once you have them on, every outside noise is blocked
Works better to block noise than ear plug, used them as earplug before
Only thing is if you touch the wires, the sound travels pretty heavily which can be annoying
They didn't fit my ears well at all , could be my ears who knows at this point service was fast and great and stuff was packed nicely
I've purchased over 20 Earbud-style headphones over the past several years, and they usually last 6 months at most
I mainly use them when I go to bed to fall asleep to a movie on my iPhone 4 or my Laptop
The problem in the past was a cheap design, and the wire from the connection would break, or bend thus making it impossible for stereo sound and they were quite uncomfortable to fall asleep with
I found theJBuds J5  on Amazon, deciding I wasn't going to buy "cheap" any more
Imagine my surprise to find a quality product that wasn't but $2-$5 more than what I'd been paying
Comfort is such I do not notice them as I fall asleep
Also, when I use them while listening to music on my computer while I work, the 'buds' totally block out any outside noise
I would recommend that you rinse the buds off before use, as I noticed they made my ears itch after a while of use
But that is not a bad thing - if you're putting something in you ear you should wash it out of habit anyway
I don't think I'll need to replace these any time soon, as they are sturdy, durable, and most of all the cord connecting both the earbud and the input  is wrapped in sturdy plastic to avoid the aforementioned issue
However, should I need another pair for a gift or just because I want to have a back up in case I forget these - I will ONLY buy JBuds J5 Earbuds-style Headphones
(Plus I dig the colors offered - black is so - not me)  JBuds you have made a 50 year old granny very very happy
Thank you for helping me get to sleep at night
sound is fantastic -- very easy to fit with the variable earpiece sizes -- would definitely buy again if needed
Not so great
I don't recommend them
They have had a short in them (from one side to the other) since I purchased them
They look good and do a good job of cutting out external noise, but I could live without them
I went through two of the lesser-quality jbud lines (cant remember which but one was like 9
99 and the other 19
99) in about 6 months each - both broke due to poor care on my part as a result of being very physically active
These buds are made to take a beating
I wouldn't let the ear pieces hit the deck from elevated locations, but I can run and exercise and ski/snowboard/mountainbike etc with these in and don't worry about the cord getting yanked or twisted, or the buds falling out
Best rugged style earbud I've tried, and great sound quality
The left earphone stopped working in a week
$30 wasted
Just buy the cheap headphones
The expensive ones break just as easily
My son was happy to see this
He said there is an on/off switch on the earbuds so you can turn them off and talk to someone without being rude
Feels kind cheap
The build quality is so so
Packed in a plastic bag with no extra protection
The major issue is the static
I think may be because it is built with metal and I am a person sensitive to static electricity
First I heard static during calls
Then it seriously hurt my ear
After a long wait I got a very good headphone
I always carried the bulky Bose on my overseas trip, but on my last trip I use these and never missed my Bose
Great product at a great price
I bought one in Jan for $ 10 less and then when I was ordering the second one, same day the manufacturer increased the price by $ 10, which is not good
But then I had to use my Amazon savings card of $ 10
00, thanks to Amazon
Now my daughter is also enjoying these headphones
After having the first set of earbuds, the left bud began mildly shocking my ear every now and then
It was only two weeks after receiving them, so I received a replacement
Now 6 weeks after getting the new set, the left earbud is completely out and will only work if the wire is held in a 90 degree angle
I applied for a refund, but this seller only gives full refunds with 30 days
They are offering half of the purchase price, and I pay for shipping
No thanks
It's a loss to me
Don't trust this manufacturer
I bought these headphones through a Groupon deal and I was amazed with the sound quality and comfy fit
I have an issue with all headphones where my left speaker always looses sound when I plug it into an ipod device
No matter what brand so I was highly dissapointed when it happened to my jlabs
I went on their website and entered the serial number, explained my issue and was sent a new pair at no cost
Extremely satisfied and now I bought myself the jlab Bomboras
these headphones really do pick up any sound/movement
Any wind or brushing up against my clothes, I can hear clearly
It's similar to using a stethoscope
It's gotten quite annoying
apple headphones are better
the sound when you talk on the phone is pretty bad
however, the quality of music with these earbuds are actually pretty good
only good thing
So I got these because I wanted some earphones that would stay in my ears when I'm on the eliptical at the gym
The first time I used them, they would not stay in for the life of me
I then took them home and tried some of the other rubber pads that came with it and found that I had needed one of the smaller sizes down for them to stay in my ears
Once I did that though, they seemed to stay in just fine
I am not to tell the difference between good and really good, but these let me hear the music when I am mowing a lawn without having to turn them all the way up, and when my kids borrow them, They say they sound pretty good
I used 1 pair for a year and a half, until I loaned them and they came back dead on 1 side
The quality of these headphones is very good
The only issue I have with them, and most headphones, is that I wish the cord was a foot or so longer
The product worked as I wIshed
They are small enough to fit in my ear and the sound is good
Bought these headphones for a friend as a birthday present and it's absolutely great
It comes with different size ear buds so it can fit any ear, it has volume control and the sound it great
I would definitely buy this product again
I would've given it 5 stars but the plastic tips provided didn't fit my ear (even though multiple sizes were provided)
I used some old ones I had from the earbuds I was replacing and they work just fine
Coincidentally JLabs sells earbud tips
Wonderful product it completely blocks out all the noise, but not to such an extent where you are unable to hear anything, unless you are of those individuals who tends to play music extremely loud
I don't know if this is my laptop's problem, or the headphones or both, but they shock me from time to time which can be rather unpleasant, but not the end of the world
If your looking for strong bass and clear sound, then these ones are good for you, but keep in mind the product can be rather SHOCKING
They had a really good sound for the price I paid, but unfortunately they split in half after a year
I did work them pretty hard, and some krazy glue kept them going to a while longer
I've tried quite a few earbuds for my iPhone and these are the ones that really work
To be more specific, I wanted some "in the ear" style that block out ambient noise, so they work pretty well on airplanes
Yes, I have a pair of those fancy noise-cancelling headsets but they are a lot bigger to carry around
These do the trick in a compact package
The other thing I value is durability
I am pretty hard on these things and the cheap ones come apart with just a little bit of use
The JBuds are sturdy and take the abuse
And its got the right 4-conductor plug for iPhone (and other smartphones)
And they sound good, too
This works pretty well
Overall a good pair of headphones
The bass is more controlled than the jbud j3 that ive had before
but j3 still has more bass
the j5 is not that bass heavy
The sound is clear, but not for what its price was
Overall its just a good pair of earbuds
I would definitely recommend getting one
First pair of ear buds other then the ones sent with the portable players that I have
Remarkable difference in clarity with these
I'm not a music buff, but I do listen to many books and these have made a great difference
For the price these ear buds are outstanding
The sound quality is great and they fit perfect in my ears without causing any pain and do not fall out when I run
I hadn't been a fan of earbuds until I got these
They're great on cutting out outside noise, and deliver great sound quality while still being very reasonably priced
I ordered these headphones during the Black friday shopping event
The headphones are of nice quality and the sound is very good
But they came without medium the 2nd medium earpiece
There were 2 small and 2 large ear buds but only 1 medium
So I wrote a complain 1 month ago on Amazon and never got a response
Louder and more bass
Makes songs i was getting tired of sound way better
recommend at this price for sure
great
They work better than the previous pair I ordered
My sister loves them
I got them for her for Christmas
Bought this based on my sister in law recommendation and reviews on Amazon
Worked fine at first then right ear bud stopped working two weeks after purchase so I had to return for refund
These are some of the best earphones I have ever used
We are currently using them with our Church In-Ear-Monitor system and the sond quality is excellent
I play both guitar and bass, and with other earphones, I would hear a lot of tintiness in the sounds, escecailly while playing the bass
With these, it's almost as good as the Sub-woofer that the houese hears
The  JBuds J5M Earbud-Style Metal Earbuds Style Headphones with Mic work very comfortable to wear for long periods and work well with Kindle Fire 8
9 and other devices
Found the sound to be quite clear after the burn in recommended by JLab
I certainly aint no audio expert but I do enjoy a variety of genres/styles and to me the treble was really distinct (i enjoy hearing the sounds of cymbals and the like,) don't care for base, and the high's of some of the musical symphonies were gorgeous
I also found the vocals on some tracks to be extremely clear
-I've been very satisfied with the quality of such low priced ear buds - definitely recommending to friends and family
I am also very satisfied with the quality of JLab Audio's customer service
I have had the ear casing from one of my ear buds dis-attach itself from the housing and JLab's simple warranty steps on their website was seamless - even letting me pick out a different color in the process
(I'm pointing this out because I read some negative reviews on their customer service on various models of the J's series, and have to disagree with the experiences of others
)Update April 21,2013Issue with no sound in one of the earbuds within 2 months
Unfortunately I can't vouch for the durability of these earphones, after having a problem with one of the ear-bud's sound quitting on me app
a month and a half after I bought them(after no special occasion - wasn't yanked or pulled or drowned) I went through the warranty process and received a new pair three weeks later(one week to send it to repair center, 2 weeks - 10 business days - to process and then ship out)
I was very grateful till the same thing happened to the pair I had just received as the warranty exchange
One of the sides just quit, I found it hard to believe being that that was the exact reason I had returned my previous pair
OK maybe 2 pairs were defective- my bad luck
Went online,filled out the warranty exchange and sent them back, after waiting three weeks, I received a new pair
2/3 weeks later one of the sides conked out on me randomly again
Now sometimes I get lucky and am able to enjoy music in both ears, other times I have to settle for half the audio experience
I am tired of packing up airbuds and shipping them out, then waiting for Jlab to process and ship them out via snail mail (as I said it takes about 3 weeks)
I'm going to try out another company with a good warranty that you hopefully don't have to  test as often as I have done with Jlab
I believe it's a gamble with them, the sound is pretty good (for an the uninitiated/ novice -like me)however you might not get much use out of them,By contrast my J3's have lasted for 6 months with heavy usage and I love them, though they are slightly bulkier in the ear which is why I  went for the J5's rounder, slimmer design
In my experience, it has taught me that "new" does not equal better
It was available for $12
90 on Amazon for a short time
This model/color is normally around $20
Very high quality and high value at 2 - 3 times the price
I like the JLABs buds for their ruggedness
They last must longer than most
My oldest daughter can go through a set of $20-30 Sony's in a week or two
Her J4's have lasted several months unscathed
The J5's aren't quite as rugged as the J4's but still pretty tough
Cheap, comfortable, and they sound great
They shipped super fast
Not much else to say, If you are looking for quality earbuds, look no further
These sound good for the price, but I used them only three times before the cord split from the plug
If it was a straight plug I think they would last much longer
I like to keep my phone in my pocket to listen to music and podcasts, the weird angle of the plug made the cord pull out from the movement of me walking
I'm dissapointed because they sound great for the price
Pleasantly surprised by the clean sound quality,  a little light on bass
Kevlar cables are great, almost tangle proof
Pick your colors and get a set
This will be my last pair of JBuds
I used to swear by them and recommend them to anybody who would listen but after having 3 pair(1 set of J3s, 1 J4, 1 J5) fail recently, I'm done with the brand
Surprisingly one of my first pair of J3s still work great after countless hours of sweat and abuse from running while still sounding great
My latest J5s didn't even make it to the first run
They lasted 5 hours then the sound started breaking up in one ear bud
Their life started with a few hours of moderate volume break in using the JLab burn-in player then some music played through them over a few days
Now they're going into the trash can right next to my J4s that are still in there(Hey, my work doesn't have daily trash pickup from our cubes)
Regardless of the warranty, it's not worth my time to ship back a pair of $15 ear buds(got them on sale here)
(Updated 12/2/13)Well I decided to try another pair just because the cost is low and they do sound great when they work
Unfortunately it was a waste of another $20 as these failed within 4 weeks of purchase
This pair was my dedicated to use at my office desk and yet they still failed without being subjected to any harsh use
It appears the connector is culprit as they worked for a bit then started getting some static in the left earbud
Wiggling the connector caused the audio to return to normal but this only worked for a bit before audio eventually stopped
These really give you the bang for your buck
I am beyond impressed with the sound quality out of these earbuds for the price I paid here on Amazon
So I wanted something with a bit of bass kick and something that was noise-cancelling but nothing too big like the over ear headphones
These little guys are amazing
I have bought 4 sets now
I have been using the JBuds J5M for over 3 months and I love them
The sleek design and pumping volume and bass in these earbuds make them amazing
I have tried the ifrogz and the apple earpods and the Juds surpass them by a landslide
When I buy earbuds I expect them to fit in my ear
With 3 different earbud sizes the JBuds once again meet and surpass my expectations
i would recommend these JBuds to anyone
I received these as a gift for Christmas
I had been using a pair of Samsung ear buds that came with my old cell phone but they're starting to wear out
I finally got around to switching to these  today and immediately noticed that the volume in the left earbud has a noticeably lower volume
I thought the volume difference might be the device I was using (Nokia Lumia 920), so I plugged them into my computer and it has the same problem
I guess I need to get them replaced - so my review can be summed up by 3 words
Dead on arrival
Update:I received the replacement earbuds and they're working much better
They sound great
Despite the quality assurance issue I experienced with the first pair
I bought these because I needed set of headphones adjustable for a smaller ear
Overall, I'm pleased but the metal on them makes them uncomfortable for extended wear
These are super comfortable, have 3 sizes, and produce great sound
I was deciding between these and headphones in the $200 range - so far these have been great
Sound quality is great for music and phone calls, the microphone picks up really well, and there is a play/pause button at the microphone
My only gripe is there is not volume control
While working out or commuting, you still have to change volume on your phone
Great for my run and biking trips, and also for my kindle fire as well
These sounds incredible like none that I've had before
I love this earphone they are Super-B
They have  a slim feeling and they don't look like they'll snap into two
It fit all my expectations and the price was not outrageous
They also came with silicones from size small to large and so they actually fit my unique ear
it works on an iPhone
If i would advice anyone to buy earphones
well these are it
Trust me you will not regret it
These Jbuds produce very good and honest sound
My only criticism is the metal design of these earbuds: when tossed into a pocket with your phone, they may scratch the screen
Perhaps an upgrade for the next generation would be a hard-plastic shell
Simple, but great headphones
They have different ear bud sizes, and deliver decent sound for being an ear bud
I recommend
This product is okay
The sound is decent and the clarity is okay as well
It is okay for the price I paid but expected it to have been better over all
These are really no differnt then the other headphones I had
They do have a nice look and they fit well
There is a lot of great sound in this little package
We just received them so I don't know how long they will last
Hopefully longer than the last pairs (not J buds) we received
I don't like over the ear or on-ear headphones, they give me headaches quick,  I was able to snag a few pairs of the JBuds earbuds from Amazon Lightning Deal for a really low price, so I thought I would post my quick review for the J3 and J5m
-------------------JBUDS J3-------------------SOUND *Highs 3/5 *Mids  3/5 *Lows  3/5COMFORT 4/5BUILD 3/5 - No anti-tangle cable/cord, really, ugh
Cord gets tangled very easily
Cheap wiring used
QUICK REVIEW:For the $14 I spent on these, they HIGHLY surprised me in comparison to other earbuds for even $40 or less
I have tried other headphones like the KLIPSCH Image S4's for $60 and even these sound better than those more expensive earbuds for a fraction of the cost
The Highs, and mids were very surprisingly crisp and clear while the lows were very low
Even though no audiophile or extreme audio enthusiast would be happy with these, but anyone who like and enjoys music and sound for a cheap cost, I highly recommend these
-------------------JBUDS J5M-------------------SOUND *Highs 4/5 *Mids  4/5 *Lows  4/5COMFORT 4/5 -BUILD 4/5 - No anti-tangle cable/cord, really, ugh
Cord gets tangled very easily
Cheap wiring used
Built better than the J3s however and with an added Mic and Audio controls is a bonus
QUICK REVIEW:For $19 I was able to snag the JBUDS J5M
These definitely sound better than the J3s but not anything too significant
The most noticeable areas of improvement were in the Highs and Mids and cleaner lows, but still very strong lows
Cleaner, crisper Highs and Mids make these a steal for $19, not even $80 earbuds I've tried sound as good as these and at three/four times the cost
I can highly recommend these to any audio enthusiasts and music lover
With the added Mic and Audio controls make this a clear winner for $30 or less
They even rival earbuds three times their cost
I had a good experience with the earbuds I purchased- I was surprised by the price but understood why once I received them in the mail
They are good quality and will last a long time
I read the reviews, and thought to myself that they had to be good and would be worth the money
they blow
one bud is 4 times louder than the other
absolutely no bass
terrible sound quality
waste of money
My brother got a pair of 8 dollar earphones and they sound great compared to these
This purchase was s disappointing
Saw these on sale and needed another set
Really impressed with the sound, a fuller sound than the other two sets I own
I opened up my ear buds last night and was very pleased
They stayed in my ear during a 20 minute jog on the treadmill
This is the first pair of earbuds I've had that did not fall out on a run
The sound quality is very good and there is plenty bass
I am very happy with my purchase as the value is tremendous
This is my moms account but I ordered the headphones as I needed new ones to replace my old pair, so I decided to write a review about them
I have been using them now for awhile and have to say these are the best headphones I've ever used, they didn't even need a break-in period atleast not for me
The bass is very good and overall sound quality is something I wouldn't have expected, as I like many others have said have owned some of the more expensive headphones in the past and man, these earbuds outperform any of them
Pros:1
Good sound quality, voices are crisp and the bass is really fantastic, it really does enhance my music a lot
2
The headphones work great with both my MP3 Player and Laptop Computer
3
The noise canceling part of the headphones is great, when using them people around me literally have to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention, probably not so great if driving but for what I use them for this is perfect
(I use headphones at night when setting up and working on the computer, so this feature really comes in handy so I don't disturb those around me)4
These things are great if you have quiet speakers as well, I usually keep my volume on the laptop set to around 40-47 but with these I have to set it down to about 24 or 25
They allow me to hear stuff better, and like I said above seem to enhance my music quiet a lot which is nice
5
They don't feel cheap either or atleast they don't to me, I would recommend these to my friends and family if they needed headphones, I half expected to get a cheap pair of headphones that would break fairly quickly after reading a few reviews
Thankfully I decided to take the plunge and purchase them anyway, and have to say I am very satisfied with the purchase and commend JLab for making a quality pair of headphones and keeping them affordable as well
Cons:I've been using the headphones for about 2 and a half days now mainly on my laptop and I have to say, they have outperformed what even I expected when ordering them, so as to say I haven't seen any of it's flaws yet would be to the point
I truly haven't got anything to add to the Cons list, as I am completely satisfied with my purchase
I hope this review is helpful to those on the fence about whether or not to buy this product, thanks for reading
Update: 1/5/2013I have had these Earbuds for only about 2 weeks and they have already shorted out on one side, no matter what I do that side refuses to play any sound, they were great in sound quality but other reviewers here ultimately turned out to be right
They short out way too fast and listening to one sided earbuds isn't a joy at all, now I wish I had gone with my gut instinct
Mind you my opinion on the sound quality hasn't changed they are still the best of what I have owned, however in light of the fact they wear out so fast I cannot in good standing recommend them to anyone, I recommend you listen to the people who say these Buds will short out soon after you purchase them
Take it from me, a person who decided to not listen and buy them anyway, they are telling the truth
Update: 1/11/2013I sent a request to JLabs in order to get a replacement pair of earbuds, I will further update the review when I receive the replacement pair to see if they work better, I will give them about a week in a half to see if they last longer than my first pair
Update: 1/17/2013I just received my replacement Earbuds and as soon as I put them on (Unlike my first pair) the quality of the sound was clear, the bass came through very well and vocals were very crisp and clear
I am satisfied with that part, yet that wasn't really the problem as my first pair decided to stop working after just 2 weeks but I will give JLabs the benefit of the doubt, only time can tell though as to whether or not this pair lasts longer than the others
Right now though, the product is back to 5 star quality
These ear buds have great sound but the left ear bud stopped working within the first hour I got it
I bought two pair about six months apart
The first set was for my Kindle Fire and they work great
The speaker on the Fire is pretty low but these critters can blast out
The second set was for my wifes Fire, again no complaints
The issues I found strange were the ones about the cables breaking and the colors do not match the photo:  I have worked in electronics for many years and one should never use cords to remove earphones due to breakage
The second is screen vs
real colors
Just adjust your monitor to whatever and complain
It must be very difficult to be a fashionista
I have purchased a number of different kinds of headsets to use with my cellphones throughout the years, but none feel better or sound better than these
And who is going to quibble about the price, anyway
Unless someone is ready to spend twenty times the money, you're not going to get a headset that sounds better or feels better in your ears
Sounds horrible, way too heavy on the bass
So heavy you cant really hear words
In addition the right ear bud quit working in less than a month
My first pair of headphones was the in ear bose headphones
While I enjoyed 3 years out of my bose headphones, I thought there had to be just as good headphones for cheaper price
Since then I have owned a few $50-75 v-modas because I enjoy a bit of bass
These Jbuds j5 are suggested retail at $65
95
After reading a lot of positive views and seeing a deal for $19, I jumped on the deal
I am truly disappointed in the sound quality of the headphones
I think a fair price for these headphones would be $9
99
My standard headphone that comes with the Galaxy SIII sound just as good, if not better, than the J5s
If you're planning to buy these, thinking you're getting a great deal for $65 headphones
think again
They aren't super bright, clear, or big on bass; it basically sounds flat
(Btw I've been using these headphones 4-5 hours a day since I bought them 3 weeks ago; I also did a 24 hour "burn in")
I'm a long time buyer of JLAB's earphones, but I'm rough on them due to my job(farm)
I'm probably close to double digits in pairs purchased
I snap cords and yank the drivers out of the body and worse
These are holding up well to me so far and and sound as good as my beloved j3's
Will continue to buy them for the price/performance
microphone doesnt work, super annoying
people I call say that It is really static-y and that they cant understand me
These come with several different size attachments so you can find something comfortable for your particular ear canal
Having said that, I can only wear this type of earbud (or any safety earplugs, too, for that matter) for a few hours before I get a little bit of a headache
I listen to music at low volume, so I don't think it's that; perhaps I'm not used to such strong bass in earbuds
These are a great pair of earbuds all the people that stay that they are not worth upgrading from the j3 are wrong I have Both and did a comparison the j5s have cleaner crisper sound with more bass and some people say that they don't last vary long I have had a pair of j5s for almost a year and I am ordering a mother pair because I dropped them in my dogs water bowl that was my fault not a problem with the product they where working just fine befor I dropped them in the water they are worth the price they are a good product I have always been happy with jlab products and will be ordering another pair
I`ve owned many in ear or on ear headphones, and believe the Sennheiser HD600`s to be the best bang for the buck, but these things are awesome at this price point
I`ve purchased Shure, Klipsch et al and they suck in comparison to this reasonably priced pair of ear phones
I don't normally write reviews but these are so bad I feel obligated
In all fairness the sound from these ear buds isn't all that bad if you can sit perfectly still not moving or even breathing
The problem is the design and material used to make the cord
When wearing these the tiniest touch or interaction with the cord sounds like explosions in your ear
You feel like you are wearing a doctor's stethoscope
Even the cord rubbing against your shirt or collar while you breath sounds like horses stampeding through your ears
I have tried repeatedly to give these buds a fair go but I am repeatedly severely irritated every time I try to use them
I have tossed them in the garbage and am going to order something else
Perfect to fit in my new travel case tp listen to my favorite music and audio books
Now I dan be in my own little world
They fit beautifully, offer a really impressive amount of outside noise reduction and the sound quality is superb
All in all I like these a lot
I have had Bose headphones which were wonderful
but for the price, not so much
When I first got these headphones the sound quality was amazing
I'm used to using cheap ear buds for music listening
About a month later the left headphone lost audio
I just went on there web site and submitted a claim and ten sent me a new pair FREE
If your looking for a better earbud than the apple pack-in or similar, pay the extra money for the J5s
They're worth it
great sound
you can actually hear the bass
well worth the money
the cord is a tad bit short, but other that i love them
The bass response is quite tight and very imoressive
I think they wil last to,  Theses are awesome
there's not much moer I can say
very nice  earphones for my kindle fire and enjoy using them and would recomend is item for ear phones easy to use
These little buds are comfortable and the sound is ok
Bass is ok along with mids and highs
Meets my needs
I have only used these ear buds maybe 10 times and the part that plugs into your device (I-pod, etc) shorted out and have to keep messing with it to get both channels
I am ready to throw them out, so anyone considering bying a set DON'T
I gave this a 1 star because 1
the microphone and audio remote do not work at all so these canot be used for phone calls, only for listening to music; 2
the cords, when rubbed against your clothing or each other,  make noise in the earphones, which interferes with music or talking (if these could be used for talking)
The earphones themselves are comfortable in the ear
These are the best ear buds I have used
Jlab has amazing customer service
I have a set of ear buds that are licensed by a performer and these BEAT the crap out of them
They look better than i expected, so tiny and the sound has really high definition
But one side stopped working 5 minutes after i pulled them out of the box
I don't know how often this happen, but i believe it's not that much
A very nice pair of ear buds
Came with different sizes of ear pads and spares
The microphone is good quality and it even included a pin to hook it up to the shirt collar
Overall I am very satisfied with the sound quality after having burned the phones and given the fact that it comes with a year's worth of warranty, i definitely think it is worth the price paid for it
After replacing my J3's, I got a try of these after going through their "burn-in" period
I gotta say, these things are great
Went through warranty once (JLAB replaced them adequately) due to one dead ear bud, however
A note to those looking to upgrade their J3's These things are a bit louder
I dropped my volume from 16 (J3) to 12 (J5) to compensate the difference
Sound quality
After comparing they seem to be better (hard to put into words)
Less bass, but a "fuller" sound
On a random note, I'd reccommend getting their JLAB JBuds Pro Tips Double Flange Noise Isolating Silicone Replacement Buds-Style Cushions for Earbuds / In-Ear Earphones - Small / Medium / Large - Black
Noise isolating, loud, deep bass, strong treble, durable, and sure as hell comfortable
These headphones are the only headphones i will buy on the market
I have tried nearly all brands (professional and not) and for the price these are kicking
great sound when playing music or Videos
Some reason the call quality is not so good
Very low and only treble sounds like all mids and bass turned off
I used my JLab J3s off and on for about 3 years, lent them to my girlfriend and she didn't want to give them up
Decided to purchase these on one of the Cyber Monday Lightning Deals and they are fantastic
I purchased the isolation buds as well ( JLAB JBuds Pro Tips Double Flange Noise Isolating Silicone Replacement Buds-Style Cushions for Earbuds / In-Ear Earphones - Small / Medium / Large - Black ) and they were a good choice
Although I don't plan on using these to exercise, they don't fall out my ears like normal designs typically do
I recommend both products, at least for a casual listener
The earbuds look quite solid, especially at the angle plug, which is definitely a + when you usually have your MP3 player or whatnot in your pocket
However, I noticed a systematic crackling noise even at the first use, when listening to podcasts or music (I used it on a iPod Nano and an iPod Touch)
So, buy it if you don't worry too much about the sound (I don't really mind, especially for podcasts)
I have had the in-ear headphones for a week and decided to do a review on them sharing my opinion
Pros:-The 3
5 mm 45 degree gold plated jack
In my opinion and find the straight cable and 90 degree jacks break way too easily
-They give you FOUR different size ear molds instead of the average small, medium, large
-It comes with a clip so if i take off my ear phones they won't dangle on the floor and get messed up
-They come in a slick design that isn't too ''showy'' for those who don't want to stand out from the crowd
Yet they're not the average 'apple ear phones'
-Cuts out quit a bit of noiseCons:-THIN wire = NOT tangle free
-Does not come with a carrying case like other Jbud products
Though not surprised considering the price for which I got them 25 CAN dollars (on special)-I don't like the ruberised materiel, because it causes to much friction when pullying it out of a bag or pocket
-creates some kind of clicking noise sometimes when listening
-ear-bud fall out occasionally, but not frequently
Sound:-Good base, but not overpowering-Relatively good mids and highs good enough for the average consumer
-Does not get 'muddy'until the volume is raised to about 90% which is superbe
Over all: Good sound, pretty good build, but that is to be expected in this price range
Random clicking noises and occasionally falls out
All in all a good product in this price range
Thanks to those who have read all the way here
I will be doing another review in about 3 month
In my opinion these are good but not fantastic
I bought these using a gift card during the $35 sale so I got a fairly good deal
At first glance I wasn't impressed; they came in a cheap foil and plastic case (almost like they came from some kind of a vending machine) and looked pretty cheap and plastic-y, definitely not worth the $65 they usually charge
When I took them out of the packaging they weren't nearly as bad as I'd thought, it turns out what I thought was cheap plastic was actually painted metal and they seemed pretty durable, or at least more so than the 2 pairs of J3's that I previously owned
At first i was disappointed by the sound quality (they sounded exactly the same as my skullcandies, which were less than 1/4 the advertised cost of these and had just as many features) but then I realized that TuneIn Radio has low sound quality and as a result there wasn't really much to improve on
After testing it with a higher quality music service I decided that they were better in quality (not $50 worth of better, but better nonetheless), although I'm not really the best judge of sound quality compared to most other people
Point is: They're better than they look, and the sound quality is better than cheaper brands of headphones, but I'm not sure if the increase in quality is worth all of the extra money
Love them, nice fit and great sound no problems at all Highly recommend them
Can't say enough nice things about them
These earphones, are impressive to say the least
Coming from an audiophile and sound/audio engineer, that's saying a lot
I that these would be an upgrade from my
broken J3's, but I didn't know they would be such a monumental upgrade
My personal thoughts:Pros:Can handle High bass levels, very impressively (If hardware/software supports high outputs)
The mids sound crisp
I find myself using the included clip quite frequently
Very comfortable, to the point where I forget I am wearing them
BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE
EVER
Cons:I hate to say it, but if there's a lot of treble (highs), such as a song with lots of drum symbols, the highs can be painful to listen to, and very washed out
Overall, these are THE BEST earphones for the price
I would go as far to say, that they are high end earphones, with a low end price tag
I would recommend this purchase it has great quality of sound
It seems like the outside noise is blocked out and all you hear is what you've chose to hear from your device
Liked the product
Worth the discounted price
I did not like the color when i viewed it first, but once I got used to it a couple of days, I like the color and the look of it
Fits well within ears and does hold most of the volume
These headphones deliver great sound quality
There is great balance between the highs and lows
Crystal clear sound that is not muddy but instead very clear
The earplugs are very comfortable
I love these
The right speaker died after 6 months of very gentle use
I only used them while sitting at my desk at work
I expected more from headphones at this price point
I've had these phones going through about 20 hours of break-in so far, though I haven't been listening to them the whole time
Overall clarity and stereo separation are really good - not earth-shattering, but very good
Response is warm, but crisp
These are not flat-EQ, reference-style phones; they have a boosted bass frequency response, typical of most modern consumer-grade headphones and earbuds
Construction appears solid, with thicker, flexible rubber grommets at all joint points that should last under normal use
The 45 degree angle on the 1/8" jack is different and seems like a good idea - a good compromise between a straight jack and a 90 degree angle
The foil-bag packaging is minimalist, and there are a total of 4 different sized ear gaskets to fit all ear types snugly, as well as a lapel clip in matching color
Overall, I am so far pleased with the purchase and look forward to several years of quality, comfortable listening
Sound is better than I expected
The quality looks solid, good price
The base is clear and defines and the over-all sound is clean
I would purchase these again
Love it
Aside from some initial difficulty finding out which size of the rubber part to use, they have work quite well
Audio is great, far better than my previous headphones, and they do a nice job blocking external sounds that may be distracting
They are also fairly durable, having survived my cat so far without any visible damage, my previous phones had some electrical tape on the cords covering bite marks
I have found that my ears will feel itchy after extended use, which may just mean I am using my computer too much
Pros:+ Good quality sound+ Durable, cat has yet to chew through them+ Blocks sound well+ Mic quality is better than my laptops built in mic (too bad I can't use it for that
)Cons:-- Makes ears itch after extended use- The larger rubber bits keep out sound much better, but become uncomfortable faster- The mic works with cell phones, but not with a laptop (requires an adaptor)Over all great, would give 5 stars if they were slightly more comfortable
EDIT 10/16/2012: Ok, so a JLAB representative contacted me about the problem and offered to work something out right away
Unfortunately, the buds are in the trash
I have to admit, I'm impressed with JLabs customer service
They obviously care about their reputation which is a good thing
So
3 more stars for their customer service:DAfter a while of use, the metal bands right below the rubber ear cups are electrocuting me sporadically
Quiet painful and irritating
I'm guessing something fell apart inside which in itself is a poor testament to quality
These earbuds are very good
It was 100% worth the money and I'm not paying $250
00 for Beats when I can get the same great sound as these
The microphone works fine on it as well for your cell phone or your laptop
They are noise cancelling, so I can't hear the sound of my mom talking on the phone or my cats meowing
I love these earbuds alot
The shipping on them was VERY fast, I ordered the free shipping and it came within 3 days
The cord is fairly long, so that helps as well
Very good sound quality as well and huge bass that shakes the buds
I definitely recommend these earbuds
They also go loud and they let out tons of awesome sounding bass
They get all lows, mids, and highs with the sound and the bass
Quite hard to beat
Here's my rating
Sound Quality: 9/10- The sound quality is great at low to mid volume
Bass: 9
5/10- The bass is crazy
It is very crisp and clear and goes from about 15Hz-95Hz with no distortion
Treble: 8
5/10 The treble is just right which makes the sound quality better
Loudness: 10/10- Loud as crap
They won't blow at high volume
Clearness: 8
5/10- Very good clarity and you can hear everythingDurability: 9/10- They are quite durable, I wad them up in my pocket alot and they are always fine
I really do like these earbuds
They are very comfortable in my ears and the sound is fantastic
The only thing I don't like is that every time I move or touch the wires, I can hear it in the earphones
It's very noisy
Don't know why this happens, but unless you are completely still, you will get that feedback or whatever the noise is in your ears
After a few month of usage, the plug connector is broken(due to the bad pistol shape design I guess)
And a week after that, the headphone piece is also broken to pieces, I have to buy Krazy Glue from dollar store to glue them back together
I still give 2 stars due to the sound quality is OK, regardless the bad overall build quality
J Buds are comfortable and the sound is excellant
The one problem is the cord rubbing on my clothing makes an annoyingsound
Really I should have just picked a known source to buy my earphones
These weren't worth it
I had them for about a month before they broke
The warranty said "good for up to a year", but at least take some pride in your work
Never again
They do not stay in my ears as I was lead to believe they would be great during exercise
Apple has much better earbuds
Pretty they are but not practical
Bought these about 6 months ago and they worked well and sounded good for a month or so until the sound from the left ear started fading away and stopped working completely
Went through the warranty online and they sent me another pair no charge, no shipping fee(the main reason why I gave them 2 stars)
The other pair worked well for about 3-4 months, after 4 months the sound from the left ear started fading again and I threw them somewhere and have never picked em up since
I didn't bother going through the warranty process again
Just to point out that I took good care of them since they were the first pair of decent earphones I purchased, however they always seemed a little hollow at the earpiece like a wrong drop would break em
I know they seem like a good deal at 50% off for $30, but unless you want to try your luck look somewhere else
These are not the best earphones I have used
However, for he price, these are a great but
I got the gray one but would have preferred the red and black one
Great sound for the prixe
The quality is not so great from the start but I was ok with these and continued using them
Just finished 2 months of using these and believe me I haven't used them much and my right ear phone to which the mic is attached is not working
Even the ear buds were pretty loose and keep falling often
Seriously very unsatisfied with the product
3 Orders = 3 Defective Headphones
I have ordered this item on 3 separate occasions: December 14, 2011; September 13, 2012; and October 2, 2012
Each set of headphones has had the same problem -- one of the buds completely loses sound
The first time I lost sound in one of the buds I thought it was perhaps because I hadn't taken good enough care of the headphones
I eventually reordered the headphones and also bought a case specifically to take better care of the set
Within a week the new set also failed in one ear
I set up a return / exchange process with Amazon
Upon receiving the new set one ear also failed within 2 weeks (I never even used the latter 2 pairs in the gym or while running)
Very hard to believe that the failure of 3 out of 3 headphones, in the exact same manner, isn't indicative of a serious defect with this product
While they lasted the quality was pretty good, but given my experience I would highly recommend against purchasing this item
I have been a JLab fan for a few years now keeping up with many of their newer models and generally enjoying what they provide
unfortunately an increasingly apparent trend of support not for their products but their warranty service became evident to me recently
on several occasions now I've received headphones that either do not work or fail within a handful of days
The company is usually very good about replacing these defects while insisting that it is uncommon however that has not been my empirical experience
When they work these are great headphones, but it might take patience and several sets before you get to really enjoy them
Best sound I've heard from earbuds, best fit too
The sounds transmitted through the cord are only a issue is listening to very soft music
If your anything like me and listen to metal, dubstep, or anything loud you'll love these
Also I wrap the cord over my ear before inserting the earbud, helps reduce the cord noise
I am skeptical of how long they will last after reading several dissapointed reviews (had them 3 days now) so will update if something happens
Update:Been 3 months now and they still work good, however I've been shocked about 5-6 times by the metal casing
Don't know how that can happen and they still work but its quite a jolt, makes me yell obscenities in the office when it happens
So I guess these headphones are NSFW haha
Still sound great though and generally comfortable
That's about it
They work, they sound alright (I'm no audiophile), the mic works for making calls on a smartphone
THese headphones are pretty good for the price you pay
I did have some trouble with buzzing; I thought it would go away after I listened to a couple hours of music and broke them in, but it stayed the same
It may have just been a defective pair- I returned them (originally in blue) and got the black ones and I've had great luck with them ever since
I've personally used the Jlab J5 earbuds
They work great, especially for mobile devices as there's a button and microphone that you can use to pick up a phone call mid-work out session
I also love that they come in several colors
I chose pink and it matches my Droid
They're stylish and easily fit into your ear comfortably, they come with extra ear pieces for optimal comfort
I'm going to be using these so much this summer when I start going for more walks by myself again
I got these headphones on one of the lightning deals on Black Friday on Amazon
com
I can safely say that these are well worth the price
Firstly, the design is very good at least for my ears
They fit in perfectly well with the "earbuds-style"
Very strong grip
Normally, I've noticed with other earphones that aren't of this design, the earphones keep on slipping out your ears
Not with these
I definitely prefer the extra grip that this design gives
Secondly, as far as the sound clarity is concerned, I primarily wanted to use these for listening to music and video chat type applications
For music, I think the sound is very crisp and loud
I think the design helps in this also (considering they fit well inside your ear and hence, your ear picks up the sound from very close)
I tried listening to different types of music (hard rock, metal, acoustic, house music, etc
) and the sound quality is generally good across all these varying styles
Therefore, definitely recommended as far as quality of sound is concerned
However, there are potentially two cons
Firstly, the sound may be too loud for your ears at times
Therefore, i would recommend using these at a lower volume
Otherwise, you might end up getting a headache
Secondly, I'm not too sure how sturdy is the construction
Although these come with an extra pair of Earbuds, but I'm not sure how long will the original ones last
I've had earphones of this type, and it has always been a concern for me
However, I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase
4 stars
These are light weight so they are easy to carry around and run/skateboard/bike with
The sound is always loud and clear
the cord is thick enough so that they never get very tangled
I like the 45 deg plug, it seems to put less stress on the cord
Most of my previous headphones have stopped working in one side because of stress on the plug
I have had these for a few months of moderate to heavy use with no problems yet
I think it is just stating the obvious to say that we all have different opinions about music reproduction
There are two camps- minimal coloration from the speaker/headphone/earbuds (like my Etymotics ER-4s, which I love, but are over $250) and those that think they can profile the sound curve better than the source music
These headphones are the latter type, but they do a very good job of reshaping the sound curve with a bit more bass and clear separation on the treble
Each has its place, but I would say that most people would probably prefer something with a little more depth than a true unmodified sound, which can sound "thin" and single dimensional to most people
If you fit in this category, these earbuds have great sound, and the price is really fantastic for the quality
Also, I had a problem with one ear cutting out, and customer service was fantastic- they just sent me out a new pair, and didn't even make me go through the hassle of sending my old ones back
All in all, with the caveats above based on the type of sound you are looking for, I would highly reccomend them
I had the headphones for only a few months when one ear stopped working
A waste of money, very disappointed
Can't explain how happy I have been with these headphones
The sound quality and fit are brilliant
I really enjoy using these on workouts and on my way to work
It's decent for it's price
It sounds really good but I think the bass is a little too much
It is not balanced well
When watching a movie, especially during the action scenes and what not the bass would be strong to the point that I can't quite make out the dialogue
This was also mentioned in another review, and it probably is an issue with other earphones as well, not just this, but it is really loud when the cable rubs together
It makes a lot of noise inside your ears
Other than these issues, I think these earphones are decent for their price
I've seen so many reviews, and then so many comments by jbuds rep commenting, which is mostly lip service
I'll go over a few of the things most of us look for in an in ear phone
Comfort, since I bought the J4 and J5 at the same time, the only good thing I can say about the J5 tips, is their not quite as bad as the J4 tips, both are very rubbery and not very soft or supple,compare them to a sony hybrid tip, and you'll see what I meanWires, more conductive of small movements than most, and they tangle worse than mnost
Sound, Bass/mids/treble all seem out of place
No instruments have a natural timbre
Voices should be far better, the lower mids are subdued, the upper mids are forward
Bottom line, there are dozens of similar products that cost less and sound better, and are more comfortable
My advice, don't waste a dime on jbuds products, I sent off an email asking a question that would be typical for a person buying in ear phones for the first time, no reply
So
Page, don't bother with your lip service on my review
Within the first week of having these headphones, the right headphone stopped producing any sound under extremely light usage
Having had JBuds (J2s) before which worked, I'm not sure if it's this generation or this individual pair, but I can only recommend that no one else make the mistake of purchasing this product
I was having a problem with my eye and couldn't read so haveing purchase the earbuds and the fact that kindle reads for you I was able to hear and finish my book
It fits very comfortable and I could read in private
I also loved the color
I've been using JBuds for a while
I upgraded to the J5 because my old J3s finally died
At this price point, I'd take nearly anything that output sound without static and tons of white noise
These earbuds go above and beyond
They have great range compared to other earbuds I've used in the past
The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because sometimes if I go running, you can hear the cord bouncing off my chest
Like, the reverberations make this deep sound in the earbuds, which are annoying
It doesn't happen all the time, though
I have had 2 pairs of these now and both have not worked on my Creative mp3 player which is listed as being supported
The only way that I can get audio to work is by holding the microphone button down and everything sounds great
That is unacceptable
I returned the first pair thinking it was a problem with that pair, but alas that was not the case
The only reason I gave them two stars is because they are fully functional on my phone, tablet, and pc
The problem is that I use my mp3 player the more than the other 3 combined
Very disappointed with these headphones especially since I have had success with JLab before
Not sure I would buy another product from them again
I received this package, gave it to my 12 year old daughter for her use, and then the left earbud dies out the next day
I wish I had saved the warranty
I wasn't expecting a defective item
Two weeks after I started using them and they are already falling apart
The right ear casing comes loose every time I take it out of my ear now and it's only a matter of time before it gets worse
I would stick with the much more inexpensive and yet sturdier J2 model or go with a different brand
I had nothing but problems with these headphones the same goes for the j2, I would say just stay away from anything that says jlab, and everything they sell is crap
These head phones are great
Super clarity and deep base
Have not had any problems, and have no problem recommending them
Have owned a pair of JLab J3Ms for the past 3 years
After the first pair died during the warranty period I got a quick replacement and some excellent customer service
After a year of abuse, including surviving a few run-ins with the washer/drier my replacement pair decided to die
Quite satisfied with the product's performance and quality in conjunction with it's relatively low price I decided to upgrade to a pair of J5MsAudio quality is excellent out of the box, can't wait to see how it sounds after the burn in period
Wires seem a little beefier than the J3Ms, should stand up to many trips to the gym in my pocket no problem
Got the sneaker head color scheme, rather than my previous black color, Looks pretty cool
Make sure to register your serial number online right away
Will make the replacement process a lot easier than if you have no clue where you put the paper a year from now
Luckily for me the Customer Service rep was able to generate a new one for me when I replaced my original J3M last year, though I don't imagine they'd do that for everyone, it's pretty top notch service, one of the main reasons I'm purchasing again
I have tried many earpieces and I could't be happier that I purchased J Buds from Amazon
Great sound, great fit and no static
Very happy
I purchased this because I also own the J4 model w/o the microphone and thought that since this was the next model up that it would be better but sadly it is not
The cable is a pain and tangles very easily where as the J4 model hardly ever tangles because of the material it is made of
After a short time of using the J5M model I purchased the J4 model with microphone and I am extremely pleased with that version
The left earbud stopped working after only a month of use, probably due to a loose wire
Don't buy these
not worth it
My jlab ear buds stopped working properly within 2 weeks
One ear bud works great , the other ear bud stopped working completely
Customer service from JLAB sucks
They never return phone calls or e-mails
I'm not an expert when it comes to headphones by any means
I have been using Skullcandy earbuds for the past few years and borrowing my husband's Beats headphones occasionally
I was initially very disappointed in these headphones
I received them and about 3 days later, right before vacation, one side went out
It would only work if pressure was applied
I was extremely frustrated
I returned them and have had my replacement for about 2 weeks and haven't had any problems yet
Here's what I like and don't like about these:The good:-Lightweight: I was a little worried that they were going to feel heavy, but they don't at all
-Less tangles: My Skullcandy earbuds get tangled every single time I take them out
These rarely get tangled, I really enjoy not having to spend minutes detangling them every time I use them
-Clip: The reason I bought these was because of the shirt clip
My husband's Beats came with a clip, so when I borrowed them for running I really enjoyed that
I run, hike and rollerblade a lot with these in and there's no loud feedback from the cord jingling around when I use the clip
This alone was the biggest selling point for me
-Comfort: This set comes with 4 sets of very comfy tips for the earbuds
They fit in my ear and stay in there well
The bad:-Sound: I might be crazy, but between my Skullcandies, Beats and these I think the Skullcandies sound best, followed by these and last Beats
My husband and I were both very unimpressed with the Beats and both thought the Skullcandies sounded better
I would still chose the JBuds over the Skullcandies due to the tangle free cord, comfort of earbuds and sport clip
But I think the sound quality in the Skullcandies was superior
-Unreliable: I'm a little cautious now after having had a pair break on my after just a few days
Hopefully that was a defect and not poor product quality
Overall, I'm pretty happy with this purchase
For $35 I feel like I got a decent product
Out of the box, the microphone housing fell apart
This hasn't ruined the product, but it wasn't a good start
In theory, I'd give these headphones 4 stars - they seemed like a decent, full-featured earbud at a reasonable price
In practice, however:- Build quality is lacking (fall apart + have strain reliefs that are so stiff they are useless
)- Sound quality isn't fantastic (I'm not an audiophile but previous, similarly priced CX200 earbuds were far better, even at the end of 3 years of abuse)- Earbuds are incredibly sensitive to the inner-ear seal (Sound is muted with terrible bass unless you fiddle with them every time you put them in)- 45� headphone jack is huge and extremely inconvenient (I feel like I'm breaking my phone half the time I pull it out of my pocket)
I'm not going to return these because it's not worth the hassle, but when these break completely (probably soon) I'm going to find another brand
________________________________________UPDATE:After less than 3 months, one ear finally went out completely on these headphones
surprising no one
Additionally, after this relatively short period of use, the aforementioned HUGE headphone jack of these earbuds has damaged the headphone port on my phone due to how often it would get caught or bent in my pocket
The headphone jack of my phone now requires constant holding pressure in order to receive the full sound signal
I'm dropping my review to 1 star
Stay away from these headphones
even if I initially received a bad unit (as their rep suggested), it doesn't excuse the bad design and terrible overall build quality
Here's a tip, JBuds - try building ONE set of quality headphones rather than supersaturate your market with SIX different failing, indistinguishable products
Purchased this item to use with my iPhone and my tablet
The plug is skinny enough to fit my iPhone while in it's protective case - many aftermarket ear buds will not
So far so good
I have the J2 earbuds which work fine
Decided to get a pair of J5s to keep at home and the left earbud didn't work to begin with
The right earbud sounds HORRIBLE
Are these from the year 1980
Bad, bad, bad
Go with a better brand
Firstly my music: Everything besides country
Predominantly Rock, Ambient/Dub, Folk, and Symphonic, smatterings of Rap, but everything else is in there too
With the different size options I found a good fit for my ears
They do eliminate a surprising amount of sound if you have them all the way in, but since I use them at work I tend to keep them just a bit loose so I can hear someone if I need too
Either way, the sound is quite good
I agree with others than the bass is not pounding, but I didn't expect that either at this price range
Still enough bass for me to enjoy my heavier genres, and the middle and highs are fine
Except on the street with tractor trailer trucks going by I haven't had to push these past the middle of my volume range, and the majority of the time I'm below a quarter and can hear every detail
Symphonic, opera, and folk works are fantastically present at low volumes, no more slamming the volume down mid-pieces that actually have dynamics
They stay in during exercise
Jogging for 20-30 minutes and push ups/crunches/various crap with nothing falling out
My only "complaint" is the cord itself
Although it doesn't get tangled up like others (big plus in my book) it sometimes can create a banging sound in the background if I don't secure it with the clip while jogging
There have been some not so magical moments of trying to fiddle with the thing to find a "quiet spot" while still trying to run
By no means a deal breaker, but technically it isn't perfect
All in all, very happy
Honestly, I don't know where to start
I am so frustrated with the products this company makes, I can hardly see straight
Instead, let me just rattle off word-associations that come to mind as I think about JLab Audio and their products: Horrible
Atrocious
Subpar
Cheap
Temporary
Disposable
Quick story: I bought a pair of the J3Ms in April
Hated them
The sound was so muddy (not even bassy, just thick and absolutely crappy), that I could barely stand to listen to them
It honestly sounded like there was something in between the speaker and my ear that was inhibiting the sound
It didn't even sound normal
But I held on to them hoping that after some proper burn-in time, they would get better
They didn't
Then, at the end of June (after barely 2 months of use), the right earbud started cutting in and out due to a bad connection with the wire
So I contacted JLab and they immediately sent me out a new pair (very nice and easy process, I might add -- they must have LOTS of experience in replacing their crappy products)
That pair lasted less than a month before the same thing happened to it
Now let me interject something here: I take very good care of my earbuds
When in use, I am careful not to let them snag on anything and I never pull on them or put any stress on them
When not in use, they are coiled neatly in a mesh pouch
They have never been exposed to extreme elements and have never gotten wet
I baby these things like crazy
I contacted JLabs again and they were kind enough to not only replace the 2nd faulty pair, but actually upgraded me to the J5Ms, which I was very pleased about
These seemed to be much better built with thicker wires and reinforced connections
The sound was slightly better than the J3Ms, but still less than stellar
These have lasted me a little over a month and then yesterday the right earbud started cutting out during my commute
I tried wiggling the wires to see if it was a bad connection, and nothing helped
Eventually, it just stopped working
Now, I know I didn't spring for some $100 Bose earbuds or something really high quality like Shure or Ultimate Ears, but I would venture to bet that a $10 pair of Sony's or even SkullCandys would outperform and outlast these over-priced and over-hyped pieces of absolute junk
Side note: I did purchase a quick replacement pair and got the Skullcandy Ink'd with the inline mic and at less than half the price of these, their sound absolutely BLOWS AWAY anything I've heard from JLab thus far
Obviously the construction doesn't feel as sturdy, but who cares
JLab is obviously good at building tanks but they have failed to figure out how to make them fire
I've purchased a couple of sets of the J5 earbuds
Within a day or two the 1st set of earphones stopped working on one side
The 2nd set lasted longer but within a few months the wiring detacted from the earphone
Try something else
These earbuds are a waste of money
I honestly love this company
These are the only headphones that fit perfectly in my ear and the sound is just great
The warranty is great-too, I get the new pair within three or so days and it's just perfect
They're not too expensive either which is great
It's hard to find good headphones for a decent price
I really only have one complaint though- I don't know if it's just me or the J5's, but one of the headphones always blows which results in me constantly using the warranty to receive a new pair
I got a pair a few months ago and then about a month or so ago, the left headphone died out so I used the warranty to receive a new pair
About two weeks later I was out shopping and I guess I accidentally dropped them (my bad
) so I felt weird applying the warranty for it because a) It was my fault I lost it b) I just used the warranty and thought it would be weird to use it again c) that's not what the warranty covers
So, I decided to just buy a new pair off of amazon, and they were on sale which was great, but after two weeks while I was on vacation, I was laying in my bed when the right headphone blew and stopped working
So now I still feel using the warranty so soon, but I guess it's what I am going to have to do
Other than that, I still love them and will continue to recommend them to my friends
I just hope that they don't break again
I wasn't picky about earbuds until my last pair died, and I mistakenly bought a Sony
Granted, they were the cheapest ones, but the bass and treble were terrible
I wept for the lost soul of my playlist
But these cost the same, yet made voices silky smooth and the battle songs rock out with a strong bass
My songs were what I remembered them as
Thanks JBud
The headphones were good while they worked, but after just 4 months of moderate use, they stopped working
I bought my sister the S4 on the same day and it's still working wonderfully
You get what you paid for, spend a little more for something better
Earphones make a popping noise in my ear constantly and need re-adjustment in my ear to make the music sound clear
Could be a fluke set that is faulty but I still would not recommend this item
The standard earphones that came with my galaxy nexus are not as loud but would prefer to use them over these any day of the week
I have two sets of J5Ms and one set of J2s (work, rink, and home)
I love them all
There is a break-in period for the best sound
Just pick the cusions that fit and seal the best and you will hear the full range of sounds
I often wear them for 3 to 5 hours straight
The cords on the J5Ms are much improved over older versions, tougher and less contact noise
Also the J5Ms have a screened in outside end which lets in some sharp outside sounds, a plus when using them for ice and inline skating to avoid accidents and in the office to hear when the desk phone rings
Microphone works well also, I haven't had anyone on the other end question what I was using
I have owned my oldest pair for several years without problems
I loosely coil them when not in use, wadding up cords will cause premature failure
To start off:These headphones  are well designed with various earbud sizes that come included along with the product it's self
Some people might not like these due to the fact that they go inside of your ear instead of the basic earphones that just sit on the outside of your ear
The reason being is because it reduces outside noise by a great percentage
====Volume====With noise reduction these earphones are really good with even the slightest volume; therefore, not much volume is needed to enjoy music
It does have good volume, but it would be great if they had volume control like other similar products
==== Appeal====These headphones look really attractive in all colors
They are sharp in color and stand out to people at the slightest glimpse
====Durability====I am impressed on the durability of these headphones
I have had these for around a year or more, but these are still in top quality and they sound just as goodmasnthe day I received them
I wouldn't think twice before getting these again
====Overall====Overall these are some top quality headphones considering the price that you are paying
Don't expect BOSE quality sound, but it definitely knocks out the lower competition between headphones
I recommend these headphones to everyone as long ad they don't really have a concern of the volume slider that most headphones now have
on time fast shipping ,perfect handling and pakaging ,just perfect , test it worrks great and huge difference between j2 and j5 it made j2 seems like normal earphone no more j2 using ,i am j5 level right now ,my advice stepup to the next level and try j5 , this dealer can shipp it to you fast enough to enjoy ur new j5 quicker than  you think
thanks
I bought these because I was constantly buying cheap earphones in the past that were breaking and coming apart so I finally decided to buy me some good quality earphones that were well worth the money
I don't wear over the head headphones since I don't like the way they look on me
I researched many headphones and stumbled upon these
I read many of the reviews and since I liked that they had many positive reviews and also came in a variety of colors I decided to buy these
As of now I've had them for maybe about 6 months and I think they are definitely durable earphones that have withed the test of time
As far as quality of sound I can't complain so in my opinion they were well worth the investment
First impressions: The product came in standard packaging that really was stress free; no childlock plastic, tape, etc
I didn't care about the cheap packaging (I kinda liked it), but if you do, go buy yourself a pair of $10000000000000 beats
The design of the earbuds was not what I expected
The headphone jack is at a 45 degree angle which is slightly odd looking and very big
Since the jack is going to be in your pocket plugged into your phone or ipod it really isn't a big deal
The chord is long enough and the stress points/ connection spots are nicely reinforced with rubber and it doesn't seem likely to break
I got the black/blue ones and they look pretty much like the picture except they are smaller than expected
Also the blue is darker but who cares
Sound quality was good even before breaking them in
The noise isolation is very good and you will most likely not be able to hear anyone if you have them plugged in and playing at a medium volume
If your looking to listen to anything with heavy bass such as hip hop, dubstep,  etc
I cannot help you because I do not listen to those genres
However, from what I can tell the bass is very rich and full sounding
Not hollow like apple earbuds
Highs and mids are also excellent
Combined with the isolation you will find yourself mesmerized by your music
They also can get very loud if needed
Overall, the sound is the best you will find at this price level and even at a higher price level
Unless you want to pay $100 for earbuds that are only slightly better I would definitely prefer J5's
Also I must mention the friction noise that you can hear when you rub the chord with your shirt or something
It is pretty noticeable without music playing; with music on I could not notice
Everyone in the reviews are saying that these are the most comfortable earbuds ever
I find that they are about as comfortable as the J3's
The earbud tips are a harder type of rubber and hurt my ear canals at first, but after a while I forget that they are there
A big reason I gave these 5 stars is because of the warranty process with Jlab Audio
It is so simple and easy
My earbuds were defective and the left earbud blew out within a week; not a big deal it has happened before with much more expensive earbuds (WHICH DIDNT HAVE FREE WARRANTY
)
I went online made an account and filed my warranty
It took around 5 minutes to do everything and they sent it to me for free
I also had the option to upgrade for a little more money which is a great option for someone who does not like the pair they got
You will not be disappointed with Jlab and their products
Their customer service really is world class
By the way, I got these for $18 during a sale on Amazon
Sound is great
Love the soft ear pieces
Worth the price, which wasn't all that much
Not worth getting the cheaper models
And, of course, it's purple
I hate this product
They either will not stay in or to get them to stay in I have jam them so far into my ear it affects the sound and it is uncomfortable
I tried all the sizes of buds that came with it (which, by the way, were very difficult to get on and off) but nothing works
I am very sorry I bought this product
The right headphones stopped working after about 2 months
I bought this J5 since my earlier J2 Jbuds wore out after more than 2 years of use and they were really great
I use these primarily with my laptop
I don't use it with any portable devices so there is really no movement which may cause them to wear out
Really disappointed that they gave way so soon
The quality is good, much better than the J2 obviously, but I'm not satisfied
The color was cute
The plugs don't stay in my ear unless I push them hard in my ears
The volumn and sound was passable
I wouldn't buy again
Upon receiving this product, I was impressed by the quality of sound
The design fit well into the ear and stayed put
However, after some 20 uses of the earbuds, the sound stopped working in one earbud
I will not purchase this product again and do not recommend it
Great sound and a cool carrying case
The interchangeable ear pieces let you fit this no matter your ear size
I ordered these earbuds AND the case a while back & after a month they had a loose connection and only one side provided sound
I had the case and I don't consider myself to be 'hard' on them but thought maybe i'd done something so i ordered them again & the second pair lasted a week before the same issue
They stink
I really wanted to like these because they look slick and they actually are nice at first, but they could definitely be better as they broke in 3 months I've had them
I'm very gentle with them and only use them at the gym/work, nothing intensive
Very disappointed
I got these a few months back, and barely used them
After 3 days of using them at work while plugged in, the right bud just stopped producing sound
i was able to get SOME sound wiggling the wire directly in the bud, but that stopped working
This product sat on an office desk pretty much untouched with the occasional use
Never in a pocket, car, folded up ,etc
I tried to register for a warranty claim, but i no longer have the package with the serial number
All the support contact links on the jlabaudio
com site are broken, so there is no way to make a claim
VERY displeased
These did not last two months and that is with 90 minutes of use four or five days per week
In fact, I counted that up and it's 24 times of use before one side started crackling and then went dead
I could see this happening if I mishandled the product, but I am always extremely careful, wrapping it up gently and storing it in a leather pouch
The heavier duty ones (more expensive) should last ten years
What a joke
I guess if I'm going to use MP3 players and earbuds, I can expect to buy new ones continually
My next pair of earbuds will be cheapies
I won't spend extra money for "better" ones
They get you no either way
It's probably made of tinsel inside
Let me just say that for the price, the quality of these headphones are very good
There is just that flaw that everyone else has mentioned, you cannot really move around when listening to music
If you're sitting the headphones work like a charm but if you plan on exercising then the noise of the headphone cord hitting your body goes straight up into the buds into your ears
Basically if the cord hits anything you will hear it and you can tolerate it but it can get quite annoying
Overall pretty good product
For the price and build quality, they're great
Sound quality isn't too bad
Fit, however, it's super, despite including 3 sizes of silicone earpieces
I'm going to keep trying them and see how they fair on long haul flights
Purchased these earbuds to replace bad Apple earbuds I got with my Ipod Nano
Excellent sound, deep bass tones and very clear
I'm amazed at what I wasn't picking up with my Apple earbuds
Very comfortable and you can customize to your ears with different size ear pads
I would recommend these to anyone who wants well built, superb sounding earphones
Earbud quality was much better than the stock iPhone earbuds, and they isolated sound well
However, one of the earbuds died within three months
I usually don't like earbuds, but when I saw these pink ones I thought I'd give them a try
They came with different size covers, so I found one that fits perfectly and they are very comfortable and stay where you put them
this item is really bad
I know it is my fault since the same incident ocurred to me before with this same headphones
I thought I would give them a second try and again after three weeks of use the headphones started sounding horrible and sound comes in and out
I had these Earbuds for about 60 days
I only used them about 2-3x a week
Then the left earbud stopped working
They cost to much for such little time
I would not recommend this product
These headphones have cords re enforced with Kevlar
They do not break easy
I am an audiophile and am all for sound quality these surprisingly have great sound quality
They have a jack that is slanted which makes it more convenient and is very strong so you wont have that problem where only on works
They are VERY well built I have had them for 6 months and I use them everyday and they go through aggressive use and they work fine there is nothing wrong with them
It is worth the price
I have problem with keeping the earpiece in place
They constantly fall out
There is nothing to attach it to the ear
This is the only problem I have
Otherwise, the sound is great
Love these little ear buds, they work great
Use them for listening to music and watching videos while at the gym or working on my laptop
I am happy with the J5, but its not as good as the J3
The J3 fits better and has MUCh better pounding bass
The J3's lasted me about a year till the right earpiece gave out though
This J5 has made it 1 month with me so far
Very pleased with these earbuds
Very good sound, with nice bass and clean highs
Very comfortable, when using the correct size tips
Nicely reinforced at the plug and at the buds, usually the fail points of less expensive earphones
A great buy at the price
Just noticed the price increased to $29
95, about $12 higher than last week
Still a good value, if they hold up to heavy use
I really wanted to love this product
but if you are sensitive to noise transferred from the cable to the earbuds then DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT
I listen to earbuds probably 50-60 hours per week and have been through many pairs
My most recent earbuds were a pair of Samsung earbuds that came with my smartphone and I had them for almost 18 months before they finally crapped out
When they died I searched all over the internet for entry-level earbuds (<$75) with a mic to replace them
I read tons of reviews and finally decided to go with the J5Ms
When I made the decision to buy them, I already knew that the reviews were mixed but I decided to give them a try
and now I wish I had trusted the reviews
Most of the negative reviews that I read had to do with the durability of the earbuds - I read several reviews in which one or both sides died within a few weeks, but they come with a 1-year manufacturer warranty so I wasn't too concerned
On the flip side I read tons of reviews that ranted about the comfort and excellent sound quality so I figured I would take the risk
What I experienced was extreme comfort, excellent sound quality, great looks, and HORRIBLE CABLE-MICROPHONICS
The amount of vibrations that transfer up the cable to your ears is massive
I sit at a computer desk all day and the slight motion of my chest from breathing would cause extremely loud noise in my ears as the cable moved across the collar of my dress shirt
Don't even get me started about when my head moved side-to-side as I switched from monitor to monitor
I couldn't imagine trying to workout with these buds in
I hoped that I would eventually get used to the noise but in the end I had to crank the volume so loud to compensate that the earbuds were just plain unrealistic for casual use
you might even say unusable
I returned them after four days of trying to like them
I don't know what I will buy next
but it won't be another set of J5Ms
PROS:*Excellent Sound Quality*Extremely Comfortable*Looks GreatCONS:*Cable-Microphonics are terrible
EMPHASIS: TERRIBLE
OTHER:*Durability: I can't really comment on long-durability as I returned them after four days
but I will say that they appeared to be very well constructed
I'm one of the lucky ones, I guess, because I have a pair of JBuds J2's that have lasted me for over two years and still going strong
I got these J5's because I know the J2's won't last forever and these JLab headphones seem to be a good value to me at $18, and not in the cheap sense
This is a very decent step up from my J2's all around
From the materials used to how they sound and they stay in my ear much better
Even the wires don't knot up nearly as bad
They're much louder and clearer as well, but at first they didn't seem to have the fullness I was expecting
However, just like with the J2's, I went through the burn-in process they recommend, mixing music in between
Now the fullness and over all sound is better
I think JBuds really need that burn-in process more then they let on
Playing them loud right out the box probably does more damage to them more than they let on as well
They have a well balanced sound which to me is good because I listen to a little bit of everything, but for some who are expecting good headphones just for one set of music, well, I don't think they excel for any one type
Good for everything, but they won't blow you away with heavy, deep bass or great detail
They're just a very decent pair of buds which should be fine for most
I'm not expecting any problems, but if some come about I will update my review
I purchased these headphones as a secondary pair for work use
I often take my Klipsch Image S4 headphones home or take them on a trip and then forget to take them back to work for several days
Instead of taking the headphones back and forth I plan on leaving the Jbuds at work
Now let's get down to it
I am one of the lemmings that bought the S4's because the internet told me to
Do I regret the purchase of my S4's after getting these jbuds for a quarter of the price
No
Why
I feel that the Klipsch Image S4 does sound slightly better
I usually listen to rock music, with some top 100, jazz, Italian opera, and folk music mixed in for good measure
I've been listening to Avenged Sevenfold's Nightmare lately (amazing drumming on this album) I noticed that the top end is not quite as clear on the Jbuds
I also feel that the mids and lows are slightly muddied on the Jbuds
The pedals from the drummer are not as pronounced on my Jbuds as they are on the Klipsch headphones
When there's allot going on, bass and lead guitar, drumming, singing all at the same time it's harder to pick out individual instruments with the Jbuds
However, if you're on a tight budget these headphones are FANTASTIC for the price
If I didn't have the Image S4's I wouldn't even know what I was missing and neither will you
I am not a huge headphone audio fanatic, so take my opinions as someone who is just comparing the two headphones
I will also mention that the Jbuds get absolutely loud as hell
I first plugged them in with the audio really high and it was like having small speakers at my desk
I am an advocate of buying these headphones based on their price point, so if price is a concern this is a really good purchase
Before I forget, I purchased the sneaker head color scheme on these headphones and the "red" color on the cord and the ring on the ear bud itself are hovering towards a bright pinkish-orange, not really red
I was very disappointed with the sound from these headphones
I ended up getting another pair of headphones as a result due the poor quality sound
These are some great headphone especially for the price
Don't buy into the bose and Dr
dre hype and buy these quality headphones instead
The sound and base are a perfect when listening to music
Another positive is they come in many different colors to choose from
The length of the cord is very generous
I gave this 4 starts out of 5 is because my cord snapped off when I stepped on the wiring and now I don't have a pair of these headphones :(, but other than that it's great for the price
I would recommend these for people who listen to music on the go
I HAVE ONLY HAD THE PURPLE EARBUDS FOR A MONTH AND ONE OF THE EARBUDS DOES NOT WORK ANY LONGER
I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND A GREAT PAIR OF EARBUDS AND THIS HAPPENED
I DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO THEM THEY JUST STOPPED WORKING
The sound quality on these are great I totally love these ear buds
I paid for them thinking it's a little much but found them to be worth it
I would still be using the ones I got before but sadly I smashed one of the buds in the door
I bought a cheapish pair but was not nearly as happy with what I got
glad to have them and can hardly wait till the new ones get here
The microphone was very poor when placing my first couple of calls
I returned them
Amazons return policy was very good
It worked for about two weeks
Then the left earbud wouldn't work anymore
The initial construction seemed to be better than the average set of earbuds
But the performace lacked
I wouldn't recommend these to other buyers
These sound very good for the price
They are not very durable
I'm the kind of person who treats things with care but they still stop working after a while and I only use them while flying (about once a week)
My first pair lasted nearly a year (so pretty good)
My second pair lost the right ear in 95 days (5 over warranty)
That said, I'm going to try the the "rugged" model this time
My mistake - the warranty is for one year
I still had the slip with the serial number so was able to order a replacement
Now I'll have two units - had just ordered the "rugged" model - so I hope to have at least one working at any time
I recently ordered a pair of J5s, and I was happy for the first several hours after I took them out of the packaging
They have an attractive and apparently sturdy design, and they are definitely a good replacement for the Apple iPod earphones that I just broke
However, within the same day of breaking them in (only a few hours, in fact), the left ear died out
There still seems to be sound coming from it, but the left/right sound balance is supremely off, making for very annoying sound
It's definitely the earphones that are the problem and not my laptop, because I've tried it on several devices (like JLAB recommended, to check for errors) including my iPod, and the left ear simply isn't working properly
The really irking thing is that there is no real remedy for the problem
Setting more left sound balance on my laptop only lessens the right ear in comparison, and I can't even adjust sound balance on my iPod
Thankfully I had already registered the earphones on JLAB's website for warranty credit
I'm currently awaiting the replacements for my bad pair
While I'm glad that there is a strong warranty program for JLAB, I would have preferred if I hadn't had to make use of it in the first place
The reliable warranty is the main reason I would recommend JLAB and the J5 to others, not necessarily for the product itself
Hopefully, as JLAB told me, my problem is an isolated one and is not representative of others in the product line
I hope that this is the only time I have to make use of the warranty
Horrible product
The first one I got, one of the earbuds failed after 2 weeks
I used them gently and they were very well taken care of
I returned it for another and that one just failed, less than 4 months later
Similar issue except this time instead of failing completely, one of the earbuds keeps turning on/off
It feels like it dying and can blow any day now
This is definitely a technology issue and probably the result of poor engineering and/or poor construction
DO NOT BUY this product
You are wasting your time
Go find something else
So I've been through a couple pair of these, failure always seems to be the same
one ear bud or the other will quit working
Wires stay intact, all connections good, the driver just quits
For the price, sound quality, an d comfort though, I'm not complaining
One thing I noticed with the black / red ones though, the red cable seems a bit stiffer than the other couple pair I had (gray and blue)
Though I prefer these aesthetically, it does increase the "thump" heard when something hits the cable (like when you're running or working out)
These earbuds sound great
The cord is nice and does not get all twisted and tangled
But
the housings on both right & left earbuds have separated
I have tried everything short of super glue to put them back together
Rather disappointing for a supposedly high quality set of earbuds
My cheap skull candy earbuds might not sound as great, but at least they don't fall apart in your ears or hands
I started buying JLab earbuds since I was travelling for work and I wanted a non-bluetooth option for conference calls or to listen to music
Through emails and sales on Amazon, I have owned around 6 of these earbuds from the J3 to the 5 and sadly, they are not worth the money
I find that I have about 2-3 weeks of use of these earbuds before I hear a distinct 'crackle' and then the right ear bud goes dead
This consistently happens while I am on a conference call and discovery the since the microphone is on the right ear bud (which is now dead), I need to put in the left ear bud, just to hear the conversation
The one good thing about JLab is their warranty
With each pair that goes 'crackle' I can claim the warranty and get a replacement in a few days
The lesson I have learned is that I misplaced the Serial numbers for a few of my recent pairs, and by not registering the warranty, I can't make any more claims
** Update 6/8:I just had another pair of these stop working in the right/microphone ear and went to put in for the warranty, and surprise to me, JLab has changed their policy on earbuds
Now instead of sending you a new pair, they are now requiring that you send in the old pair (at cost to YOU) so they can verify it and then they will send another pair
This just made their product that much more unappealing to me
I'm going to order another company in a moment to replace the 5 of these that i have and are broken
I have gotten already three of my J5 replaced due to malfunction in different areas but i have had them replaced all three time with the one year warranty
Make me question the quality of the J labs earphone if they keep breaking on me
Other then that the seller did a good job
**Purchased these a month and 6 days ago (April 1st) and the right ear just went out (may 7)
** I will attempt to go through the warrenty process/support service, but I would rather pay more to not have this issue
Bass is okay, but I feel as though the speaker went out
A little better than the apple products
My friends have beats by dre, skull candy, seinnheiser, vmoda, etc
So for the price, I would say it's worth it
but not for the time alloted
Noise/sound cancellation is pretty good
My friends always have to wave in order to get my attention
I was studying at a busy restaurant and I couldn't hear anything once I started playing my music
Ear buds: Maybe I'm not used to in-ear buds, but they fit pretty uncomfortablly
I constantly have to input the earpieces until I find the right place to hear the music
However, I am able to wear them for over 7+ hours
These are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever owned
When using them they stay put
They are soft and supple and do not hurt my ears
There are also several colors to choose from even though I chose black
Great quality sound
I ordered these after having a pair of J3's and wanted to upgrade
These are not very expensive but the J3's sounded pretty decent
Upon getting these and connecting to my iPhone 4, callers complained about static then they could not hear me at all
It was not a reception issue as once I put it on speaker, everything was fine
The button would not hang up the call and when using it on iPod mode, would not skip, rewind, etc
Maybe I got a defective pair but I returned them (Thanks Amazon) and got a different pair of headphones
Maybe I will try them again in a later version
Rugged, incredible sound, isolation, clarity, good bass (not incredible bass)
Doesn't tangle, i like the color because it is easy to find and to not get mixed up with other people's
stick in my ears very well (have smaller ears) but there are multiple sizes
The makeup of the buds make them stick
For those of you out there who know more of the Jlab models, I used to have a pair of the Jet Black J3's after replacing them about 3 or 4 times i decided to upgrade
When filing for a warranty claim I upgraded and got a ten dollar credit and got these for twenty dollars
So far I have had them for 2 or 3 weeks and absolutely love them
They are way more sleek and comfortable, they also were very interesting with the color scheme of the sneaker head so it was quite the change from black
These headphones stay in my ear better therefore making the sound better with a better seal and it was also better because of the high quality model
So far best headphones ever bought
PRODUCT IS AWESOME WILL RECOMMEND TO OTHERS
SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME
I ORDER THE BLACK JB5 J BUDS ARE AWESOME COME WITH DIFFERENT SIZE EAR BUDS FITS GREAT
I do not know about all the technical stuff that's on other reviews, all I know is the sound is great and I like the way they are made with reinforcement and angles that keep the wire's from breaking like my last set
Worth the money
The ear phones are good sound and quality, and a good price
The only thing that i would like to see different, ar the blue ear pieces
They are made of a soft rubber, they are comfortable, but if they were made of a foam material, (like ear plugs) they would  fit alittle better, and not wiggle out in extreme conditions, (heavy/long running)
AAA+++ ease of use sound and weight
Easy to store carry and use
Good sound and I like the choice of different ear pieces that came with it
I really wanted to like these
While the sounds quality was much better than any other earbuds I've purchased (and I expected them to be considering the price), one of the channels broke within 3 weeks of using them
I only use them on my morning and afternoon bus commutes
I've always neatly wrapped them up and put them in my bag for safe keeping when not in use but I guess this didn't matter
I've used cheaper earbuds that have last 4-5 months
What's the deal with these
I'd say poor craftsmanship
Seems like they were designed to break
Why is the plug at a 45 degree angle
I'm no engineer but this is not a natural design
90 degrees would obviously work better but even just a straight plug would make more sense
I'll never buy anything from JBuds again
Don't be fooled by the decent reviews
I'd rather buy cheap earbuds
at least they'll work
I couldn't even get a month out of these
I owned a pair of J3 earbuds that worked really well for two years, so I thought the J5 would be good too
Boy, was I wrong
Like others here, the left earbud stopped working after about 3 weeks of light use
Fortunately, I received a refund without any problems
Very disappointed with JBuds because of this product
I bought two pairs, one blue, one red
The red pair had only one side that worked
The blue pair worked for a few hours then one side stopped working
I contacted Amazon, and received replacements within one day
Customer service was excellent
The second red pair again had one side that did not work at all
The blue pair has one side that fades in and out
I am returning both for a refund and getting a different brand
While they did work, if there was any movement or rubbing, you were able to hear it
Very annoying
These headphones broke on me in about 3 Weeks after I recieved them
Although they sound amazing, they have an extremely short life span
Not worth the money
Crap headphones, just worked for 3 weeks
I'm a regular runner and after 3 weeks of jogging the right headphone stop working
I had for 2 years the J3 and had the same issue but after 2 years not 3 wekks
Won't buy from this brand again
I purchased these on 2-29-12 and use them 5 nights out of the week at work for 6+ hrs a night
Right out of the package they seemed very well built and seems quite durable
After popping them into my ears I wasn't very impressed with the sound quality
They were just O
K
Not any better than a cheap $5-10 pair
I would even go to say some of those cheaper ear buds provided more range and I've been through about 10 different sets of ear buds
There even seems to be a fitment issue with these
If you push them in too far or not enough, sound quality is horrible and the buds make a popping noise in your ear
Just a slight touch sometimes is all they need and it's like they double their volume
I would not recommend these at this price range
$10, maybe
Skullcandy ink'd sound better
4-11-2012: The left ear bud has some loose wiring inside or possibly at the blue flex joint
After some wiggling you can get the ear bud to work but only for a short time
So I went ahead and checked out their warranty information on their website and went ahead and made a claim
It was quite simple, really
New ones are on the way
Bass is great treble sounds clean and high notes tweet like a bird am happy with this purchase and use it all day while I work thank you
I'm 16
I've done some stupid things with these headphones
I've put the cord in my mouth and then walked away, scraping the cord against my teeth
I've yanked the cord out multiple times accidentally
I rubbed an earbud against the carpet to clean off earwax, which ended up dislodging a piece of the earbud (not the rubber part), but it just snapped back on
POINT BEING: Despite all my idiocy, they still work perfectly, and the jack is completely unbent despite being jerked out at an angle innumerable times
HOWEVER there is a downside, at least compared to my sister's headphones (Which are admittedly $80 over ear headphones)
The mix of them is a bit too bassy, although I can sort of adjust the bass level by adjusting how far I push the earbud in
The whole thing just sounds a bit muddy compared to these: Sony MDR-XB500 40mm XB Diaphragm Driver Extra Bass HeadphonesI'm only comparing with those cuz they're the only headphones I have around to compare with
I'm not a sound expert, if it's not obvious from the generally stupid things I do with my headphones
SO YEAH
5/5 for tank-like construction
Not taking any points off for Meh sound quality because my point of reference was a more expensive item
:D
THIESE ARE JUNK; BOTH EARS STOPPED WORKING WITHIN 4 MONTHS
I do not abuse these; I have never pulled on them or anything rough with them
DON'T BUY THIS CRAP
Not happy with these
I prefer my Sony Ear Buds, had them for years and they still work great, just don't have the microphone
I really like the JBuds for my iPod and Kindle Fire
They match color-wise perfect and the multiple rubber ear cones make it very easy to find the right fit
The sound is great
I can hear my iPod very well while I'm out in the tractor and don't have to have the volume blaring in the process
I would highly recommend the JBuds
Arrived quickly, no issues, cool design
I bought "Sneaker Head" because I loved the color combination
I use it with my iPad
Also comes with 3 different silicone ear bud covers to fit differnet sized ear canals- kids, women and men
Lastly, there is a clip that is placed on the cord so that it can be clipped to your shirt or whatever you please
One thing that has struck me is that the parts and the design have a distinctive feeling of quality to them
This item does not feel "cheap"
Nice
Why is it impossible to find a pair of headphones with decent sound quality that break or short out
I bought these because I thought the unique design might somehow be a smart idea and solve the problem I had with past buds breaking down on me
Wrong
After about 20 days of a great pair of headphones, the place where the rubber meets the plastic near the jack split exposing the inner wire
Now begins the search for another pair of most likely problematic headphones
I think I'll just get wireless
Picture here[
]
Love these
I am instantly impressed
Songs that I've been bored with for years come to life again with these headphones
I already own the older version of these, which are good, but these are even better
Won't put up with cheap apple earbuds ever again
You can look at all the other reviews for how these work and whatnot
For me, they fit awesomely (rare, my ears are weird shaped) and sound good
But then the right earbud died as soon as they were out of warranty/Amazon's return policy
The other one still works, but having noise-cancelling headphones with only one working bud is pretty lame
That being said, I'm buying another pair and hoping for the best
In the Amazon photos, the cord color of the 'Sneaker Head' JBuds is a deep red, which is what I wanted
What came was actually more of a deep rose, not what I wanted at all
and not quite what seems to be primary color black and red in the images
Sent them back and got these in silver gray, which I like a lot
This isn't a review of the JBuds' performance (which, so far, so good), but rather the color
If you're a fashionista looking for a deep, robust red corded headset, this isn't it
These earbuds work very well with my iPhone
Clear sound on calls, good for music, durable
I'm pleased with my purchase
The sound of these earphones is as good as I have experienced in phones of a similar size -- probably better
Highly recommended
I've gone through 2 pairs of these now
The first lasted a month before the left ear bud died
Got a replacement pair for free from JLab, which lasted a little over a week before an ear bud died
For headphones I use at my desk at work, they die way too quickly
Trying another pair through the warranty, if it dies quickly to I'm going back to SkullCandy
- The buds are fairly comfortable- Good sound- Great warranty service- Ear buds just don't seem to last very long
Finally, got this earphones with mic
I must say that the sound quality is awsome in my Galaxy note
It feels your are listening to dolby sound with 5
1 channels on
but as far as speaking using the earphones, it is not that great, cuz the jack (pin) of the earphones is not fitting correctly inside the hole provided for it
The hole is slightly taperd (not fully round) so the jack stuck and does not go inside fully, so you need to adjust it to get the clear sound while talking
The quality of material is really good
I need to use it more to get the best out of it
I will recommend this to anyone but only for listening to songs and not for talking
I've owned a few JLabs ear phones and the sound quality has been great - these are no different
I think
After a days worth of use the left ear phone went out - the same issues that other people have had with this set of head phones
I'm not sure if I got through the burn in period before these things crapped out on me, but the sound was getting good
Just wished both earphones worked - I'll be looking to return these suckers and see if I can go back to the J4 model which at least made it past the 6 month mark
<<EDIT>>When I contacted JLabs they were very awesome about getting me a new pair of the J5Ms and these ones worked great
The sound quality was impressive, but the life was a little lacking
One of the ear buds started to crack in and out last week and now it is completely sound free
This is about 5 months after the purchase
The sound quality was awesome during that time and the fit was great, but I just wish these things would last longer
I treat mine with care
The J4s I had before came with a nifty black carry case that I've been using for my J5Ms and can't remember a time when I've mangled or tugged the cord
I do use these for working out and for when I'm sitting at my desk - so in total I probably log 6 hours a day on them
By my bad math, that's roughly 900 hours of use before they tanked on me
Since this is the 3rd set of JLabs ear buds that I've owned and have crapped out on me I think I'll probably be trying another brand
Also, I upped the star rating to 3 stars because, when these things worked, they were awesome
The headphones won't even stay in my ear
Sound quality is terrible
No bassDon't buy them, it's a waste
I decided to buy some more expensive ear buds to use with my new Kindle Fire
I received these ear buds in December and have used them approximately 10 times
The right ear bud broke last night - I just removed it from my ear and it broke apart, exposing all the wires
I tried wearing just the left one but it kept giving me a little shock
My window to return has closed so these cost me quite a bit for just the 10 times of wearing them
I would like to return them but I can't which I don't think is right
If something doesn't hold up under less than normal conditions  it should be deemed defective and the buyer should get their money back or at least a credit towards the purchase price
these earbuds have very average audio quality, and the described microphone i assumed incorrectly would have a volume control as well
the microphone does not work with the Suri app on the iPhone the way apple and sony earbuds do
and the cord is uncomfortably long and thick
i did not send them back which was my responsibility of course, as i was away and unable to do so before time period
i wanted to steer others away from these earbuds; there are far better ones for the same price range
Best headphones I have ever owned
Great value, I used to have the skullcandy Titans and these are both more comfortable and sound better
Great product
I purchased these earbuds to go along with a Kindle Fire which I gave as a gift
I understand they do not stay in the ears very well and fall out easily
I'm disappointed
I bought them, because of the relatively good reviews and good price
They worked pretty well until one side just started cutting out and I thought it was just the placement of the bud in my ear
I adjusted it and it would come back and then cut out again
Finally it cut out and didn't work at all
They are good, but they fail pretty quickly which is less than 2 weeks in my case
As the title suggests, the audio quality is very impressive but if you pay attention to it, you notice that one of the ear buds doesn't fit perfectly, i mean, it doesn't make that vacuum feeling that blocks the outer sound out
I ran some tests and the sound comes different thanks to this, i also posted a picture showing this (you can see it right here: http://www
amazon
com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B005VP9MOO/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_0
ie=UTF8&index=0) NOTE: i tried different sized sets of rubbers
These are great headphones (more correctly Ear Buds)
The sound is superb and the fit is great
They still have the annoying resonance that all ear buds seem to have when walking at a fast pace, but that's a small quibble
Great sound with the phone as well
They don't operate the iPhone's software as well as the Apple Ear Buds but, for one third the cost, I'll put up with some inconvience
They fit better than my last pair of JLabs
I wanted to buy a pair of Jbuds J4M because I lost my old pair
When I went to the J4M page, there was an Amazon announcement touting "a new version of this product is now available
"
So naturally, I thought that newer is better, right
There was a whole description of how the J5M was released for the anniversary, was the next model, bla bla
Bottom line - the J4M are much better
The #1 problem for most people with headphones is durability
most earphones go to crap within weeks or a few months because of their cables, and that is where the J4 excels above the rest
It has an incredibly thick, sturdy cable that withstands anything and thus gives you more bang for your buck and a fantastic lifespan
The J5 is scaled back - thin, cheaper construction, and overall not as good
No wonder the price is cheaper too
I thought I was getting a good deal, but the J5s wore out and split open within a month
Spend the extra $10 bucks and buy the real deal
Nice going with the new model, JBuds
next time, don't take one step forward and two steps back
Use what is great about your design already, keep it and improve upon it
These headphones are great
The quality of sound is phenomenal
Love that they come with different sized tips
As a result, no matter your ear size, you'll find a tip that fits
The tips are actually, really cool, as they pop off the headphone itself, to enable you to find your perfect fit
Those tips you don't use, keep in the accompanying resealable bag
you never know when someone may want to borrow your headphones
The long cord does not twist or tangle and comes with an attached clip
I use this clip to keep the cord in place, after wrapping it in a circular fashion
To protect these headphones, I purchased the JLAB cover
Very pleased and highly recommend these headphones, as well as the JLAB cover
These JBuds J5M earbuds are one of the better earbuds i have ever used
My ears don't like earbuds, they never fit right, these have 3 sizes so i get a much better fit but the more important thing is they sound pretty damn good, much better bass than expected and the microphone for the phone works perfectly
I am well pleased with these earbuds
These things lasted a couple of months before the cord just broke in half
The money on these was wasted
I've been a fan of JBuds for many years, and I've tried the J3s, J4s, and J5s over that stretch
I really liked the durability of the J4s, specifically the thick, flat cables that rarely tangle
However, the J4s have a bit of a muddy sound, so when those died on me (the right ear stopped working), I decided to pick up the J5s
First off, the sound was quite a step up from the J4s
Much clearer and cleaner
I was, however, wary of the super-thin cables, and for good reason
I've had my J5s for probably a month and the right ear already died on me
Unbelievable, especially for a brand I've used for years
It's crummy to put the consumer in the position of choosing either the worse-sounding, sturdier J4s versus the vastly-clearer, brittle J5s
I should note I also take extremely good care of my earbuds
I never use my J5s for jogging, and I definitely never wear them to sleep (I use the legendarily-bad stock iPod earbuds for that)
Needless to say, I hope this was some fluke mistake where the right-ear cord got tugged too hard coming off the line or in transit
So yes, I'll ship these back and get a new pair, since I don't think I can go back to the murky J4s, and yes, the J5s sound good enough to risk another malfunction
I'll stick with JLabs until some other company decides to make great-sounding, affordable earbuds; even with my current woes, that's how much I trust the brand
But that's just me
If you're hard on your earbuds, go with the J4s or look elsewhere
These are small but powerful headphones and with the Earbuds they are easier to wear and keep in your ears
They are compact and with the storage case, they are an ideal addition to my new Kindle Fire
I HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH THE EARBUDS I PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON FOR MY KINDLE FIRE
THEY HAVE ENABLED TO THROUGHLY ENJOY THE MUSIC THAT I HAVE PURCHASED FOR MY KINDLE FIRE
The earphones are sturdy (a little heavy), well made, and deliver great sound
Background noise is almost non-existent-it has to be quite loud for you to notice
I'd buy these again
After one month ( just outside the return limit for amazon ) the right side stopped working
This is my second set of headphones from JBuds
I had the J4's for a year before the wires broke at the plug ( my fault from keeping my cellphone in my jacket pocket and kinking the wire every time I would put it in my pocket )
With the J5's having a slightly different plug I figured they should last a bit longer
Unfortunately, that wasn't the case
I should have paid a bit more attention to the reviews that mentioned that one side would stop working early on
Earbuds came quickly and as advertised
Great volume and quality sound
The extra earbud adaptors was also a good value
This worked out just fine for viewing and hearing films on my Kindle Fire
Fast delivery and reasonable price
And it certainly is easy to store in its case
These J5 Earbuds are really nice earbuds for sure, however the silicone ear pieces in my mind suck
The ones that came with these headphones did not fit my ears at all and did not create the sound results i wanted, not to mention they fell out of my ears every two seconds
I ended up putting on Sony's earpieces onto these earbuds, they sound great now with clear sound and good bass
Overall, good earphones, just the silicone earpieces need redesigning in my mind or buy a set of the Sony earpieces if you buy these earbuds and they will make these earphones ten times better
I have tried a number of different earbuds for my iphone, including most of the higher end offerings in the Apple store like Altec Lansing and Sennheiser
These Jbuds earbuds put out a sound on par with any of the $100+ earbuds I had tried previously, which all seemed to break eventually
And these jbuds are at a lower price point
Plus, I also like the look and feel of these earbuds and they are comfortable to wear
I would recommend
JBuds J5 Earbuds-Style Metal Headphones for iPod, iPad, Tablet, Kindle (Pink Lemonade)
speedy shipment
Different size buds to fit any ear
Works great
i had these head phones for only one month before one of them blew out
i didn't have the volume high at all
I put in on in the morning with them working fine and then in the afternoon, they stopped working
I love this product
Very nice bass, very durable product and come with 1 year warranty when registered on their website
I've only been using this for about half an hour now so this is my review out of the box
The packaging was simple, easy to open
It came with three additional pairs of gel, I liked the standard one the best
I am not an audiophile but the sound wasn't very impressive
Nothing I haven't heard before
It isn't that bad either though, slightly better than those cheap earbuds
Comfort wise, you barely feel them in your ears unless you pull the wire
It fits securely in my ears and only comes out when I tug on the wire
The wire doesn't feel cheap and feels durable but not necessarily as durable as expensive earbuds might feel
I'm not entire a fan of the V shape design but it isn't that bad
I would like it if this came with it's own small case but sadly it doesn't
The shipping was incredibly fast though
The earbuds themselves are actually small, which is a good thing for comfort
Overall these aren't bad and I would recommend them to a friend
I like a lot of bass and these deliver that, but they do not balance the highs so you get a very flat sound that is overpowered by Bass at all volume levels
They might be OK for some Rap
If MP3 players had an equalizer you might be able to compensate, but I am not aware of any that do
Very disappointing for the price
I have spent much less money and gotten much better sound quality
Lets hope at least that they are durable as the design implies
However, given the sound quality it probably won't matter because I will probably just toss them in a drawer
Which really makes them a rip-off now that I think about it
What good is durability if they sound like crap and you don't use them anyway
I want my money back
I have recondidered my review, and givethis product a fair rating
Bass isnot as I was expecing, but it is adaquate
Wish the earbuds were marked, L and Right
It's because my right ear is weaker thanmy left
I decided to keep them, and not return theproduct
Maybe I was expecting too muchwhen I placed the order
I guess the customerwill have to figure our a way to keep theearbuds from falling out of your ears
Maybe I will take a small piece of a rubberband, and super glue it to the front of theear bud
They have earbuds on the market now, that STAYin your ears, and I should consider them
Sincerely,  Hank Roedell
I purchased the J5's and Skullcandy Ink'd at the same time to go with my Sandisk sansa clip zip
Incidentally, the ear buds that come with this were surprisingly good but being the shape they were they needed constant repositioning in the ear
Any physical activity would have been out of the question
Anyway, the Skullcandy's arrived first
I was very disappointed how "thin" they sounded across the entire musical spectrum
The ones included with my player were superior
The J5's came a few days later and I was very impressed
The sound was "rich"
The bass was prominent and the mid range and highs were fine
They were a man among boys compared to the Skullcandy buds
They also were close to $10 more so that must be taken into account as well
In reading some of the reviews it seems the J5's are not all that durable so time will tell
As for now, I am very pleased
I have had these for nearly a year now and have had no problems
I use them when I want to just relax and listen to music
In other words, they do not get a lot of abuse
I think that the people who have had problems with them put them through too much and the cord gets yanked more than once which they don't like
I recently tried some Bose $99 ear buds and the J5's were as good if not better
Can't go wrong for the price but treat them nice
I have been using mine for months and don't notice any signs of wear
The wires feel like they will last
I like the 45 degree connector
This is probably my first time actually buying headphones
Previously I never had to, as I simply used the ones that came with ipod
But the iPod ear buds broke, so I was looking around for some great earbuds
My friend told me about JLab, Sehensier and SkullCandy
I checked out all 3, and ultimately I went with JLabs J5 because the inline mic would be useful
This cost more, but I guess you get what you pay for
The earbuds came in a pretty small, thin packaging
What comes in it
The earbuds, 4 size tips, a clip, and a card containing the serial number
NO manual is included, but the card sends you online to access the manual
When I get earphones, the main thing I look at is sound quality, how comfortable it is in my ears
The sound quality is amazing
I'm not even an audiophile, but even I could tell this is a significant upgrade over my original earbuds
Songs sound crystal clear, bass is good, it sounds like there is a mini-subwoofer in my head
While playing one song, I heard some strange noise, and I had to pause because I thought there was something wrong with my earbuds, or something's out there is going on
Apparently it's not any background noise, it's part of the instrumental in the song
While wearing these earbuds, I was able to discover new elements in songs that I have previously never known
Amazing
Now I'm listening to my music library over, rediscovering missing elements of a song
The Earbuds are incredibly comfortable as well, once you put them in, you can barely feel them
They have an earplug effect, so once you play a song, you totally isolate yourself from the outside world
There are 4 size tips, from 1-4(smallest to biggest)
I have smaller ears, and I found that the size 2 are the best fit for me
If you think the earbuds aren't comfortable, you are likely using the wrong size tips
Don't assume which one will be the best, try on all of them for a while and see for yourself
I made a couple phonecalls with the mic
I used a Droid Incredible 2
Call quality was clear, and my girlfriend had no problem hearing me
There is one button on the mic, pressing it once plays/pauses your song
Pressing it twice skips to the next, while trice skips to previous
This button worked for both the iPod Touch 4G and Android Phones
Not sure about other devices
The earphones will stay in your ears during workouts
One way you can prevent it from falling out is to wrap it up and around your head
The downside is that sound of the cord hitting your body while running
Personally it isn't a big distraction to me
It's normal for sound-proof earbuds though, ever tried on an earplug
You can solve that problem by using the clip on the cord
The J4s look a lot more durable than thisOverall, excellent earbuds
However, the J4s do look more durable than this
Durability is something that can only be tested with time
I've only had these for about a week
I'll update this after a while, and see how these earbuds hold up
As for now, I'm happy with my purchase
I bought, after reading reviews
Let's start with sound
Which is the only good thing I could say about these things
I didn't fully burn them in, but out of package I could def
hear potential
Out of package bass was good, the rest of sound is muddy, but u can tell that would change after burn in
As far as everything else
The build reminded me of the klipsch, just didn't think it was very durable
And finally, that wire noise
It's simply unbearable
I mean u touch the bud while in ear, and u get a incredibly loud thump, just touching it
Touch the wire, and u get a loud thump, that gets louder, the further up u go
I cannot recommend these buds
Unless u lay perrfectly still while listening, u cannot enjoy these buds
J-Lab please work on that
That's def
a deal breaker
I've never heard wire noise that bad before
I use to buy $15 buds
Had the Jbuds for about a day before making decision to send back
For 30 dollars I was expecting performance that would be better than a 10 dollar set, but was not the case
Did a comparison with some entry level Sony's, and there was no comparison
Maybe they were faulty, the volume was extremely low compared to 3 other sets of buds that were cheaper
Bass was non existent
Sent back to Amazon
Do not recommend
These earbuds are fantastic - comfortable fit, great sound quality, reasonably priced, small enough and pliable enough to fit inside anything
I use them while at the gym or on long walks, and they stay securely in my ears, too
Sounds good
Nothing special
Doesn't stay in ear
keeps falling off despite multiple ear adapters
Gave to my nephew
I never liked in-ear headphones
Guess I need over-the-head headphones
For what I paid (19
99 when these were on sale) I'd say it was well worth it
There are some problems like some weird static when I use them on the computer, but they do exactly what I bought them for: comfortable headphones that help block out noise
I have tried the $300 earbuds and this one, and believe me there is no difference if this one is not better
The only down side is that it hurts your ears after a while of listening to music, but you can fix that using the right size ear bulbs
A great value for an awesome set of earphones
My previous set were nearly double as expensive, and these have better sound quality
Athogh I have only used these for 1 day, I am very very pleased with them
Sound quality is excellent, bass is a major step-up from basic Apple headphones
Here was my experience though once they came:I could not get the inline remote to work with my iPhone 4
I tested it and it worked on an ipod and Droid, so I was very confused, and angry
After registering my product on the JLab site (1 year warranty) I was able to make my claim and a new product was then shipped to me at no cost
BUT
I called JLab just to see if they could hep, and the guy recommended I check my iPhone headphone jack for dust
and so I did
FOR ANYONE NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE REMOTE TO WORK WITH YOUR IPHONE, GET A DUST REMOVER AND THAT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM (3-4 sprays)
Anyway, now I have 2 completely functional headsets thanks to JLab
Love the metal construction, although the earbuds will take some time to get used to, and they do tend to slip out of your ears if you are not careful
The sleek but so far sturdy colored cable is great
So far, these are excellent headphones and well worth the price
As far as earbuds go, these work just fine
They get 5 stars because they function as well as an earbud can be expected to
The soundstage is pretty closed, but I find that with all 'buds
The response is smooth and pretty accurate, with adequate bass
I cannot compare these to "high-end" 'buds, but compared to similar priced offerings from Koss, AT, and the likes, these sound very good
Construction is rugged - I don't expect any problems
they are ok for the time being, will look  for some better ones even if it means paying more money
These were my first in-ear headphones
Being used to the standard iPod headphones, these took a little while to adjust to
At first they felt a little awkward and still do at times (I've had them for about 5 months)
They are not extremely comfortable, but they have grown on me over time
The sound quality is very good, especially compared to the iPod headphones
It is almost impossible to hear anything going on around you while wearing these headphones so that's something to consider if you plan on jogging or biking in public with these
The major downside to these headphones (and the reason for only four stars) is the amount of noise you hear from hitting the cord while listening to music
It is very distracting, and it only takes slight movement to make the noise
This means that if you are running with these, you really have to crank up the volume to try to ignore the sounds from bumping the cord
Overall, these are great for studying or anything that doesn't involve much movement
Even with the cord noise, these are still better than the iPod headphones for workout and running
These headphones are wonderful creatures except for one thing: their fragility
On my first pair, the connector between the jack and the headphone broke, and within a week of reviving my second pair, the right ear blew out
Bottom line is: don't buy them
Yes, they have both the Amazon and JLab warranty, but after two pairs in less than  a month, I think I'll switch brands
I bought these when my Skull Candy set quit working and man am I impressed
They arrived quickly and exactly as they were described
Cord length is perfect for the gym
I know you can spend a lot more money for ear buds, but I don't know how the more expensive ones could be any better
Is the sound Good
Yes
These sound better than the BOSE that cost upwards of $120
However, the microphone stopped working twice now
The first pair within 6 months I requested the warranty worked but for the microphone and skip functions, then my second pair stopped working again within 4 months
I bought these mostly for the cheap price, good sound quality and the microphone
But I will not buy again if the lifetime of the microphone is a 5 month period
They still work as headphones, but every time I need to answer a call I must remove the headphones since the mic doesn't work, and the microphone on the phone is disabled if the headphones are plugged in
Received these JBuds for Christmas and love them
Nice fit into the ear with a comfortable fit
I recommend these
These buds are worth the investment
Look nice, feel nice and sound great for the cost
Highly recommended for the average user
Very "tinnie" sound quality
Worthless for music listening but okay for narratives
I would not recommend these to anyone
Your money is better spent elsewhere
Got these as a Christmas gift
Broke within 3 weeks
The right ear bud broke apart
Excellent sound while it lasted though
For the price, I expected them to last longer
I bought these ear buds for my son for Christmas, and he loves them
He said they are better quality than other ear buds he's used
The comfort and the fit are the best qualities of these ear pieces
I have owned several ear phones and these have been the best yet
The soft buds with different sizes make this the ideal set to buy at such a reasonnable price
Bought one pair and they stopped working after about an hour of use
RMA for a new pair and the replacements stopped working after about two hours of use
Buy a pair of sony instead
The buds keep popping out of my ears - I find them uncomfortable and extremely frustrating
Sorry I bought them
I've had these headphones for a few weeks now, and I'm very happy with them
For ear-buds, they sound great
I upgraded from some $10 walmart inner-ear headphones, and these sound far better especially the bass
i guess this is more of a j4 review than the j5;my favorite j4 was better;the bass was deeper and the timbre clearer without too sharp of a pitch;alas it broke after 13 months exactly to the day when i ordered it (also from amazon);don't know what to say about that, maybe it's just its lifetime;but i can say this about j5 when i thought of ordering a replacement: "hmm
1 number  up, would be better i'd guess or at least the same";it's not;for "one version newer" it's worse than j4;not so bad that i can't use it at all, but the pitch is so high, gives me ringing ears after about 15-20mins of use (that's just barely 4-5 songs);no bass at all;basically j5 is everything of what my j4 was not, in a negative way;i don't feel like returning or exchanging it, too much hassle;and i'd probably give 1-star if i were in a bad mood;but i guess i'll be nice and say i don't like it;j5, y u disappoint
They work with ASUS TF 201
Sound is very good and Skype connectivity is very good as well
Good and fast service
Would recommend to all
I have purchased "JBuds J5M w/Mic" as replacement of the regular iPhone Headphone because I've lost it
Its perfect if you want to use as headphone only BUT DON'T but it if you're looking to use the microphone it make noises that the others would NOT hear you at ALL
I've asked amazon for replacement hopefully the replacement will work this time, Thanks to Amazon
Great sound quality, fit, and design
The left bud however stopped working after four weeks
So disappointing
I would not have been so upset for $10 headphones but for $30 I expect the device to last for, say, a month (or longer is fine too
)
1 star
UPDATE:BUYER BEWARE
Second pair again stopped working too
These are perhaps the most fragile headphones
The saddest part is that I do nothing that should test the devise
DO NOT BUY
I bought these as a gift and she loves them
They work well with the iPhone, are comfy, and have the microphone built-in for taking calls without having to put the phone to your ear and mouth
It was my first JBuds purchase and I think I'll try them again
i bought these as replacement for my old bluetooth headsetthey hasve such rich sound that i love them they also come in nice colors my wife got the pink onesonly problem while wearing them if they brush on something you can hear like a rubbing soundotherwise i love the jbudswill be getting the ones with microphones built in next
I have been a fan of jlab for a while now and was completely blown away by the sound of the new j5's
They have a great build quality that equals the j4's and the sound is even better with a sharper bass response plus a better overall sound in the middle/high ends
I have been a fan of jbuds since I first bought the j2's
These are of the same quality that the jbuds have lived up to
The only problems were that it didn't come with a case, which they usually do come with, and that when I got them mine were defective
When I plugged them into my iPod and played some music the right earbud was quieter and had worse sound quality than the left one
But I had no worries because I returned them for some new ones and now they work great as they should
Pros:-Great sound quality for the price
-They fit in my ear great and come with a variety of earbud sizes
-Cord is long enough for my daily routine
-Not too heavy so I can use them for running
Cons:-They were defective when I got them, although it might only be a small percentage of  ones that are broken as when I got new ones they worked great
-No case to put the earbuds in
Overall they are excellent earbuds for their price and I think they are worth it to buy
Hope this helped
I originally thought these earbuds were awesome
They fit well, sound good, and weren't too pricey
The only complaint I originally had was that the in-line controls offered no volume control
Besides that, they felt like a great buy
Until I started getting little electric shocks in my ear
At first it just sounded like static on the line (weird for my own MP3s, but not earth shattering)
Then they started actually feeling like shocks, each one feeling like a bubble was BURSTING in my ear
I found this annoying and slightly painful, but they happened so irregularly that I figured I could continue using it
Then the right earbud went dead
The in-line controls still work, so the wiring issue has to be from the earbud down to the controller
However, it is not like I use these in high contact or abrasive areas
I have never removed them from my desk at work, so they have been in a nice, calm, safe environment since purchase, yet they failed
I only had the item for a month or so, so this came as a big surprise
They seem to want to help me out, but since I threw the original packaging away after I opened it (who holds onto packaging anymore
), they want me to mail them back, just to get a serial number assigned to them
I imagine after they mail the P
O
S back to me, they will want me to then RE-MAIL it back to have them fixed
A lot of hoops to jump through
This will be the last pair of headphones I ever buy from J-Labs
just not worth it
The product as met expectations and the overall value is excellent
I would strongly recommend them to anyone who is looking for a superior product
These are excellent earbuds
They're very comfortable, deliver great sound, and are extremely durable
The sound, including the bass, is outstanding
Great sound, has noise cancellation of earphones three times as high and excellent stereo separation
Great service on delivery
Using them on my Kindle Fire
received the JBuds today
The Right bud did not work at all
The Left one worked fine
Also did not receive a invoice in box
When I sent it back for a replacement didn't have one to put in box
This was very careless of Amazon
Listened the sound quality of this earphone from a friend of mine and I was pleased with the overall sound quality, especially with the price, you can't go wrong
Planning to buy one for myself
This product does not have any volume control
You cannot even receive calls by pressing on the one button
Not just that there are times when you will go mute until you take off these headsets
You can spend your money buying something better
Even standard apple ones are better than this
What a pleasant surprise
How nice to listen to music, radio, Kindle books without external noise distraction
Does not eliminate all noise (good because we still need to be aware of surroundings) but these are light-years ahead of what we had been using
The multi-sized earbud cushions (included) are nice for different purposes
The price was right and should have upgraded years ago
They fit my ears, they sound great, dont have a problem with the static or echo as some reviewers reported
Of coarse this is my first time using ear buds, always used earphones before
I thought the price was very reasonable
I bought these for my son, and he loves them he is very particular about his earbuds, he has small earcannals and these are perfect some are too big, but these are perfect, and they have wonderful sound quality, he listens to a lot of base, and it doesn't thump your head, :)
I've never ordered a set of earbuds off the Internet before, but I have to say I'm glad I did
These headphones sound as good as my system in my truck
They have awesome sound with great bass
They're high quality headphones that honestly should cost more
haha
As a guy who has bought every pair of JLab Earbuds since J3, these are easily the most comfortable
The different sizes for the heads can fit just about any ear, they don't fall out of your ear, the angle on the wire is perfect
The only complaint is that after a few weeks owning the J5M's, the earbud with the microphone attached to it died on me; I'd stick with just purchasing the J5's
I must say that I really do like the bass in these jbuds
I also like the selection of extra buds
I actually swapped the ones that were on them with a smaller pair which fits perfectly in my ear
With the smaller pair, I am able to fit the jbuds a little deeper into my ear thus allowing the bass to sound fantastic
The smaller issue with a little cord movement being heard is very minimal
If you touch your fingers anywhere near the mic, you can hear through the jbuds
They are sensitive that way
But its minimal and definitely does not distract from the amazing sound quality at all
I like them so far
I even found a little case to keep them in so I can keep them in my purse without damaging them in some way
These were purchased on a whim to replace plenty of other (lesser quality) ear buds
These are great
The sound quality is crisp
Highs are high and the lows are low which doesn't happen that easily with lesser ear buds and get this, they stay in your ears while cancelling out most noise
I would and have recommended these to others
I once had the J2 headphones but alas, I lost them
I came back to amazon to order them and saw that there was an updated version
I got the J5 the next day
I immediately put them to use
Come to find out it does making that popping noise when I put them in
Also, the left earbud refused to work
One positive is that You can't hear anything else the world is saying
some how the earbuds seem uncomfortable to wear
the sound on the headphone is good
I give it 3 out 5 stars
There are two J5 JBud models
One with microphone, and the one I bought by mistake
Headphones are great and sound super clear, I just wished info had been clearer a the time of purchas so I could detect I was making a mistake
This is my third pair of JBuds
I also have a set of J3s and J3Ms (both still working)
These, however, lasted about a month and a half and then the right ear bud stopped working
I thought that they sounded very good while they lasted, but I don't think I'll be getting another set
I bought the J5 as a replacement to the iphone speakers
The J5 was awesome - nice bass and midrange - which is lacking on the iphone speakers
The problem is after 2 weeks of use, the right side stopped working
It took a few weeks but I finally got a replacement from Jlab
I got a little frustrated with the replacement process but eventually, the company was able to work it out
I really like to give this product a 5 star but I'll hold off for now until I get some more usage and see if this new pair lasts for a while
I bought these for my wife to use with her iPod nano at work
She really enjoys them
At first her ears would get sore after a couple of hours with them in but I am glad to say that her ears are used to them and don't get sore at all anymore
They come with a variety of inserts/ear pieces to fit in most ears
We recommend this product
i bought these to send to a Marine that is serving in Afghanistan, he is  very happy with my choice, thank you so much for your prompt service as it takes time to mail to him there
JBuds J4 Rugged Metal In-Ear Earbuds Style Headphones with Travel Case (Obsidian Black)
I purchased the first set as the reviews were fairly positive
I liked the swappable rubber gaskets so you could get one that was most comfortable for your ear size
One side of the ear phone felt like it was giving me little electric shocks and became too uncomfortable to wear so I ended up just using one side until the replacements came
The second set suffers from what sounds like a gieger counter when you dscover radio active material (only way I could think to describe the noise)
I have used in multiple devices and the same result
Sending them back today
Very useful when I want to watch or listen to music on my Kindle Fire
I love my K
F
and I am always very pleased whenever I purchase anything from Amazon
These earbuds are of poor quality
The earbuds stopped working within 3 weeks of use
Although the sound quality is good, it poor quality will cause the headphones to stop working randomly
The earbuds I ordered and received work perfectly with my new Kindle Fire
The tone and volume are just right
They are a pleasure to use
I had the same problem as a lot of other people that the bud split open after a week
Too bad, I've liked past models from this manufacturer
Going to start off by saying that I don't ONLY listen to metal
=)These buds deliver impeccably perfect balance between bass and treble
They are loud as hell and the sound quality is ridiculous- as in sick- as in incredible
I've gone through multiple ear buds in the past- these without a doubt take the cake
I'm talking about sound so clear, you feel like you're hearing a whole new song due to the fact the precision in the technology of the ear buds almost allows you to hear "new" sounds in the music you are listening to (no joke)
The fit as well- is wicked
lots of ear piece sizes to choose from
love that
All around- this piece is uber rad and I highly recommend
cheers to loud music
I have purchased $10 earbuds that are far and away better quality than this
The overall sound quality is just awful
Day 2 of owning these, the right earbud just stopped working
Just a piece of junk
They were great for a whole two weeks
Then the left ear piece stopped working entirely
I stored them carefully in a case every time I was done with them and didn't abuse the wiring at all
I've always been a fan of JBuds, but given their tendency to malfunction (this is my third pair that's done just this) so quickly, I'm going to have to start looking for a company that provides a much better product
I have bought jlabs j2, j4, and now the j5
I think one of the main reasons why i continue purchasing from this company is the amazing warranty they offer
My j2's broke in about 6 months, but thanks to the one year warranty, I was given another earphone
My j4's lasted 2 years and finally died but the j5's lasted the shortest
I absolutely love the sound quality of the j5's, but the quality makes me sad
The connector between the earphone and the wire became shotty and cuts in and out after 2 weeks of normal use (laptop office use)
If it were not for the warranty I might start looking into other brands
I really want to like this company but the quality continues to dip after each subsequent headphones
Speaker blew on the left side after just 24 hours of use there is now a loud crackling sound from that side only, I even switched ears
I'm returning them and getting a different brand
I don't trust the quality of these
Especially after reading all the reviews of how the speakers blew
I received the earbuds and was initially unimpressed by it's simple plastic wrapper packaging and lack of a nice carrying case that the J3 earbuds came with
So after I ripped open my plastic bag and looked at my earbuds the first thing I noticed is the quality
It feels dense and solid, not squishy like the J3 earbuds
The ear rubber pieces are ok but still they need to make them thicker/denser
I noticed that the ones that came with the J3's got softer over time and eventually very uncomfortable as the hard plastic rubs up against your inner ear
Which is part of the reason why I decided to upgrade to these ones now
The wires are a thick heavily coated rubber, imagine like the rubber on the batman suit, it looks like that
The connectors are all gold plated
Yada yada, I figured if they just sounded a little bit better than the J3 earbuds I'd be happy since I bought those on clearance and those were great
The first thing I thought when I started the music was "wow
" I actually popped my head back a little as a reflex
The bass is BOOMING
Like crystal clear
It sounds like I installed a Bose subwoofer inside my head right now, I'm listening to Drake's new album
Any way by the time "I'm so prouda you" came on I was balling like a little school girl
The sound was so intense that it overwhelmed me
I think these would be an awesome gift for a chick
I think they would get me sex
I really do
You should buy these
I bought these headphones on November 30th last year
and the left headphone is already dead
I noticed that the noise coming out of it was much softer than the right side, but I thought oh well maybe it'll fix itself
Two days later, there's not a single noise coming out of the left side
Plus, when I used these heads for a run they do not stay in place at all not to mention, when the cords rub against each other its so loud I can hear it with music playing
definitely will not be purchasing these again
I bought these a few months back
I used to have the original Jbuds, and they broke very easily
This model has a much better elbow on the audio jack, so it has been holding up much better
The bass sounded awesome on mine until I left them in my jeans and they got machine washed
I let them dry out for a day and they still worked
The bass was significantly reduced afterwards, but I am still pretty impressed
JLabs have a really good warranty, too - just keep the serial number that comes with the headphones and you can get them replaced if they break
I purchased these earbuds for both my boys - 14 and 18
They are both really happy with the quality - and my 14 year old is really happy with their fit
Bought a pair of JBuds J5 headphones for Christmas
They lasted one week before the left earphone stopped working
We returned them and the "new" pair did not work at all
Same problem
Junk, crap, buy a different pair and save time and money
They need to test this product before put it into the market
The headphones will fall off from your ears
No bass coming out from the headphones
I do not like to complain and I actually hope these speakers were defective
My wife also bought these and hers were as bad as mine
I used the earbuds that came with the Apple IPod to compare and bang, there was the good sound
We returned these immediately
Sound was tinny, no base at all
Avoid
I must agree with "Brian"s review of this product
From the packaging to the quality of the earbuds the product made a good impression
Once I adjusted my Iphones eq settings the sounds was very warm and rich
Definately more than I expected as I was primarily buying these buds for their Iphone controls
However, after listening to them for a few days I am going to replace my trusty Seinheiser buds and use these for my daily commute (3 hrs of train travel)
Glad I bought these
The J5's are a nice improvement over the j3's
They seem to have a bit more bass just got them today
I ordered them through Amazon next time i will order direct
Amazon charges tax and there free shipping was extremely slow
If you order direct you can take advantage of a promo 20% OFF through Facebook and there is no sales tax
I thought Amazon would have faster shipping
not
Next time I need a pair I'll buy direct from jbuds site
Sorry Can't post there website amazon will sensor it
Pretty good but not great
Sound could be a bit better
Plus cord could be a bit longer
But for the money its good
These headphones are very good sound quality great price great product and is very high quality for 30 dollars
Amazing sound good base, and comfortable
I love the sound and the quality build of the earpiece
As i bought two, one for me and another for my friend, one of the earpiece I received was spoilt
As I reside in Singapore, I contacted the customer service and they were willing to send me a new one after I provided them with pictures of the spoilt earpiece
I gave it 2 stars off because they promised that they will ship out the order in 24 hours upon confirmation but it was only 2 weeks after that they shipped out
Their customer service was very prompt, however, due to whatever luck I was in, I received another defected one
This time I contacted them but to no avail after 2 days, thus, I am still waiting for their reply
I have had a few different styles of earbuds from various manufacturers and to date these J5's are my favorite
I have heard much more expensive buds before (about 150
00 price range) and these compare very favorably for a fraction of the price
The manufacturers "burn in" instructions were followed to a tee and DOES make a difference in the quality of the sound
I found the other key to the quality of sound is the fit
If you make the air tight fit you will get the full range with excellent bass
I love my pair and I'm happy with my purchase
Ordered on 27 Dec 2011 and received on the 29th
After less than one week of use, the left ear bud started to cut in and out and is now out about 95% of the time
Now, I've owned the J3M buds with the same problem with my first pair going out after 3-4 months but I could not have been happier with the second set provide under warranty, they sounded great and continued to plug away still after almost a yr
but unfortunate while helping my in-laws move, my buds were lost
It was for this reason I decided to go with the J5M as replacements as they were the upgraded version
Well, I haven't had them working long enough to find out
And now, as some other reviews have written, this seems to be a very common problem with these earbuds and yet I cannot process a warranty claim thru the JLab website because it is impossible to navigate beyond the Troubleshooting section
I have sent three emails to JLab concerning this in the last week but so far have not received any type of response
So it seems that I will be returning thru Amazon and forgo any type of warranty with JLab Audio
This will be simply money wasted
These Jbuds work great, sound good and are just about as rugged as they get
I've left them in my work out clothes and washed and dried them 3 times now and they still sound the same
I bought a backup just in case, havn't had to crack them open even after the washer and drier events
These headphones are cheap, not just inexpensive, but also poorly constructed
When I went to change the interchangeable rubber earbuds, the speaker actually detached from the body
It seems like they used cheap glue to put everything together
Since this happened within minutes of opening the product, I returned them
Even if I had been extremely careful (now knowing they are quite delicate), these headphones would clearly have eventually broken in the same way from normal use
I'm assuming most people will throw around their headphones in their pocket or bag or wherever
I doubt these would stand up to such mild "abuse
" Overall, I was hoping that these were high-quality, inexpensive headphones, but sadly, they're just cheap
I suggest forgoing these and instead purchasing higher quality products, as those will easily stand the test of time and be worth your while
I purchased these for $20
I used them once and the housing came apart on the right side
I tried again; this time the sound started fluctuating on the same, right, side
I tried a third time; this time the sound went out, I went to take the headphones out and the earbud broke off while still in my ear
This is why I buy from Amazon- Thanks for returning it guys
I purchased the Jbuds J5 Earbuds for my 14 year old daughter for the Christmas Holiday 2010
She absoulutely loves the product
The pink color also helps
My daughter is very technically connected and uses it for her iPod, and Ipad
The sound quality is very crisp and clear she can hear every beat her teenage heart desires
Usually when i make a purchase to enhance her technical experience i don't always get it just right, but guess what the Jbuds J5 earbuds did it
They are very lightweight and the cord isn't unusally long they fit into her ear snuggly and not just bothersome either
When they are functioning correctly, these earbuds are pretty cool
They look nice, and the button for answering calls also allows you to change songs forwards or backwards when you're listening to music
The problem with these is that when your ipod is in your pocket and you are walking around, the right ear bud causes occasional small shocks (at least once an hr)to your right ear that don't seem safe - especially if there is a larger shock later
I don't know if this has to do with the electrical wiring or connection, but I would be wary when purchasing this item
I got these buds for my son for Christmas
He was delighted-for the first hour of listening
Great range, clear highs, not excessive bass
Then no more sound out the Right earbud
What a bummer
I read some great reviews of this product, so I'm giving them a second chance and having them replaced by Amazon
Amazon certainly makes the replacement process as painless as possible
I hope the replacements live up to the great reviews
I bought these earbuds looking for headphones with great sound, noise cancellation, bass, good looks, and inline controls
These headphones met all my expectations except there are no volume switches on the inline controls
There is only a play/pause button and a mic
the play pause button is very very slightly wobbly/loose but it is definitely nothing to worry about
the mic works great with good sound quality(or so my friends tell me)
the mic is better than the apple stock headphones mic by a lot
the button itself performs well, it does play/pause/next track/previous track/and cancels calls
also if you hold down the button it activates siri for the iphone 4s
very good for if you are too lazy to take your phone out of your pocket constantly to change the song
as for the missing volume buttons it does not make a big impact because iphones already have volume buttons on the side
the only problem ive had with these earbuds is that i have small earholes so i used the smallest size(there are 4 sizes total) but the right earbud slips out every once in a while because it is too small
i think i might have differently sized earholes so it might not apply to other people
anyways the sound quality is great and the bass is decent
the line is not too long but it is a decent length, long enough comfortably walk around with your phone in your pocket
the stethoscope effect that everyone says plagues these headphones is barely apparent
not a big problem
these earbuds are fine to walk around in but i wouldnt recommenend jogging
Anyways these headphones are great, they look cool, and are definitely worth the price
(retail value is $50)
These are inner ear buds, so expect the normal rattling in your ear until they adjust
Very high quality sound, and quite cheap too ($29
95)
I ordered them on 12/30/2011
They were expected to come by 1/9/2012 and showed up 4 days early on 1/5/2012
I love the way they look, and I'm a very satisfied customer
I purchased these earbuds for my nephew as a Christmas gift
Here it is January 28th, just over a month later & they don't work
He said that for the time that they worked the sound was awesome but now he only hears music out of 1 side
I realize that they were not the most expensive; yet they weren't the cheapest
Even if they were I would think they should last longer than a month
These earbuds have a good quality sound when listening to music or playing movies on my iPhone
It's in a phone call that the quality diminishes
I bought a couple of these around Christmas with a special JLabs was running
I've used their J4M's so I decided to try these out
To my dismay both J5M's have the same problem that there appears to be a design flaw where the wire goes into the 1/8" jack because if it moves during a call the person on the other line can no longer hear me talking until I jiggle the wire and get it to reconnect
I have sent 2 emails to JLab in an attempt to talk to them about the problem I'm having with no response
So at this point I would vote against this particular model
when you touch the cord, you hear a static sound, something is strange about the sound when in contact with something, but it all comes from the cord when it touches thing
Great look and color and the adjustable earbuds fit, however the sound quality was inconsistant and would get static and every time I turned my head I would get a shock in my left ear
They had to be defective
NOT FUN
I had to return them
The cord for these earbuds pick up noise from the slightest movement or touch
Maybe mine are defective, regardless it is very annoying
I am not pleased with this product
I absolutely loved these when they worked as they were small and lightweight and didn't stick out at all
They also came with multiple size tips which is always a plus since these types of buds are never one size fits all
The sound was great straight out of the package and it did what I wanted in having a low volume setting while still having clear music
I was only able to use them for about three weeks before I realized it wasn't my ear clogged up (like when the altitude changes while on an airplane) and it was indeed the right bud that no longer worked
I don't know why it took me so long to attempt to see if I could hear out of the other bud with the "clogged" ear
Unfortunately in the three weeks I did use them, it was very infrequent as I wanted to take care of them as much as possible as they were new and shiny
I actually think they went out within a week and a half to two weeks with roughly 3-5 uses on them but at the time I really believed my ear was clogged since you plug up your ears and all that
This resulted in a total of under ten total uses before only one bud was left in working condition
The thing was that there was no indication of it going out at all, no snap, crackle, nor pop
Now, I just throw them around carelessly since they're already "broken"
TL:DR;Pros: Looks nice, lightweight, comfortable, does what it shouldCons: They seem to not last very long
Thats what I get for going for it as maybe half(
) the reviews I'd read about it stated they didn't live very long
I've dragged them through snow
I've rolled around on them all night
I'VE PUT THEM THROUGH THE WASHING MACHINE
They still sound amazing
Kthxbai
I have a thing for purple so when I saw these I just had to have them
They are a great length so they don't pull out of your ears easily, and they are small enough to be quite discreet when they need to be
I bought them for my Kindle Fire but they also work with my iPod
These earbuds have an awesome color-scheme that really adds to the "wow"-factor
They're a lot smaller than I expected since I previously owned a pair of Shure E2G's
The medium sized earpieces that came with these fit my ears perfectly, although I haven't worn a pair of in-ear buds in a while so my ears are still getting used to things being shoved into them
I've had it for 2 days so far and the sound quality is fairly decent considering the price-tag
The low-ends are pretty good for small buds but the highs don't seem too crisp to me
I'm not complaining though - I'll mainly use these at work or maybe working out (not sure since the wires do seem pretty thin) and not for any of the music editing/production or DJing I do
I'd go for buds that are of better build and sound quality for DJing
This set is also cool in that it has a built-in mic/remote on the right ear wire
The button works just like the ipod touch earbuds I've used before - 1 click to pause/play, 2 clicks to skip the current track, and 3 clicks to back up a track
I do kind of wish there were actually 3 buttons - 2 more for volume, but that's not too big of a deal
Overall, this is an awesome product for the sub $40 price and I'd recommend it to any mobile device users seeking a pair of cheaply priced earbuds
Being a poor college student, I was heavily debating whether to get these headphones or to opt for a less expensive pair
Now that I have them, I'm very glad I bought them
The sound quality is great
I tend to listen to a lot of rock and metal music, and it sounded nearly as good through these headphones as it did on my brother's brand new $250
00 beats
They're also very durable
I've used the J2, J3, J4, Q1 and now the J5's
The J5 earbuds sound the best
I've been using these J5's for almost two months and will update later about their durablility
As for the complaints about the cord noises----just run the cord over the top of your ears then insert----noise problem is solved
I bought these in anticipation of my buying the Kindle Fire
I used the ear buds with my iPod touch and they are phenomenal
Not only is the sound quality wonderful, but they eliminate outside noise (my co-worker had to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention, she said she had been yelling my name but I definitely did not hear her
)  That is soooooooooooooooo worth the price
I will get a pair of these for every audio device I own
CAUTION  Second day review
down from four stars to one star CAUTION
do not expect to be happy with these earbuds if you plan to move at all while wearing them, unless you can keep the cord from touching your body anywhere
Every single step I took this morning went right up my legs, through the wire, and reverberated like a loud drumbeat
Every rub of the wire against my coat produced crackling
AMAZON, drop this product
It is unacceptable
Fabulous sound
Fits great
Will be buying more when I lose these (premonition)
I'm no music affectionato, but these buds are bringing me closer
I'm bummed about these headphones
This is my 5th pair of JBuds in less than 2 years so I've accepted that none of their headphones last very long but one of the earphones on this pair went out after 4 hours of use
Prior to the earphone malfunctioning, I was very disappointed with the sound
I've owned 4 pairs of J3 earbuds, which I bought over and over again because of the sound
They blocked out just the right amount of noise so that I couldn't hear the music in the gym but could tell if someone was trying to talk tome
The J3s have great bass and dynamic sound quality
The J5 earbuds sounded like speakers that had blown because they had been played too loud with the bass too high
The sound had to be played at a very low volume, otherwise the sound quality deteriorated and sounded scratchy
I also didn't like the length of the cord, which I found awkwardly long
I preferred the length of the J3, which has a small piece that holds the cords together under your chin
This piece reduces cord movement and helps keep the earbuds firm in your ears
The J5 earbuds don't have this piece but come with a clip attachment
I couldn't find a way to make the clip useful
There were two improvements to the J5 compared to the J3
The earphone tips fit better and stayed in my ears better
The cord attachment to the plug appeared to be stronger
I'll give the J4 earbuds a try before I go back to my Sennheiser CX 680 Sports headphones, which last through everything but don't sound as good as the J3s
i wore them for two weeks till they fell out of my hears ,hit the ground and no longer worked
sounded good while they lasted though
ive droped other ear buds and they seam to take the hit and keep working and they were under $15
00
so my rating is two stars
These ear buds are good for listening to my music, but not for long periods
The bass is a bit too much and the high notes too high
The middle is lacking a bit
But, they are comfortable and the price is great
I have these earbuds for over two weeks now and they do seem to sound a little nicer before they were exposure to those pink/white noise
I originally bought them as a set of spare therefore I wasn't expecting anything spectacular
The sound on these are decent, nothing too dramatic in difference to talk about
Depending on how you place the tips, the bass will overcome your vocals dramatically
While I do like lots of bass, the bass seem a little off and not quite as good or clean
On some songs, it can be overly annoying
The mic seems to work well on an iPhone (mine was iPhone 4)--haven't tested on other apple products or devices
The call quality is above average
The person on the other line do notice a clearer call quality as compared to without the headset
I have not had any problems with the button--assuming you are using it for fast-forwarding, replay, pause, and continue
I primarily use this earbuds/headset for running
The earbuds does seem to stay on, and depending on what tips you use, it can be good or bad
The package come with a clip that you can attach to your shirt, thus making it easier when running so the wires wouldn't get in the way
I use a Belkin armband with a Belkin cord capsule (easily wrap your eadbuds' cord, this and the clip makes it a lot easier for me to run)SummaryBASS: 7SOUND: 8DESIGN: 8DURABLE: 9MIC/CALLING: 9BUTTON CONTROL: 10Ultimately, if you want a spare headset/earbuds that has pretty decent sound and are on a budget, I would recommend getting one of these
UPDATE as of 04
24
12The left earphone is no longer functional
I had couple of issues with the right one as well but it started working fine last week
My lifestyle is not a stress-test simulator for these headphones so I really don't know why they would die out and leave me hanging with just one earphone to work with
I take care of them really well and I usually carry it inside my backpack's mp3 pocket
Guess I have to check the warranty
Excellent turn around time
Excellent packaging
Excellent product
What more can be said
If you make it inconvenient to rate a package, I just won't do it
Although the sound quality is good for this price range, I am not particularly satisfied with my purchase
The inclusion of an inline microphone was a deal-breaker for me so I was very disappointed to find that the microphone does not include volume controls
I reread the product description and though it does not say that there are no volume controls, I find it a bit disingenuous that the absence of this feature is not mentioned
The closeup pictures led me to believe the volume control was part of the middle button, which looked to me like a toggle switch
Obviously I was wrong and I became so annoyed with the lack of volume controls (and my inability to break the habit of clicking on the inline button to adjust the volume) that I stopped using them altogether and have reverted back to the crappy Apple earbuds
That said, if you are looking for run-of-the-mill earbuds at a good price and couldn't care less about volume controls, these are a reasonable option
Unfortunately, since I haven't used them but a few times, I can't comment on their durability or longevity
The sound and everything was good
But within one week of having them the sound went out on one side of the earbuds, so it only works in one ear
I have had this problem in the past with cheaper headphones but they atleast lasted months before breaking
Very disappointed as I thought a more expensive pair would bring better quality
Better off just buying a couple of cheap pairs for this price
These really sound great
The fit could could be better, the buds tend to need to be reseated too often
These earbuds got good reviews, so I purchased them as a gift for my brother, who recently got a new phone
Unfortunately, after one day of use, the right earbud stopped working, for no apparent reason
As soon as I received the product I noticed one of the ear phones was not working as well as the other
I called Amazon to return the product
Since it had come directly from JBL I was asked the pay the shipping fees to return
Upon receiving the credit I noticed that they deducted a re-stocking fee, even though the product was defective
Upon contacting JBL I was told that the product worked fine when they received it, so the fee was deducted
Don't bother with this product, there are better options on Amazon with the same or lower price and no return issues
Shipped super fast (actually, it arrived before Amazon suggested which was super cool with the Christmas holiday being a factor), and was exactly as advertised
Will order again
Thanks
Love the attractive Sneakerhead Red/Black combination
They look pretty sturdy
Not too keen on the rubber hosing, as it gets caught on my clothes and bag
Sound is great if I can keep the buds in my ears
One size bud is a bit small, requiring constant tucking, and the one up is a bit big which gets uncomfortable after a while
The sound didn't take long to "break in" at all
These were replacements to my favorite Sony earbuds which stopped working in one ear after 3 years (I take great care with daily use, but stuff happens
) Unfortunately the current issue Sony earbuds, are now similarly ill-fitting, whereas they were once so comfortable I could wear them for hours
Perhaps I need more time for my ears to acclimate
human ear holes being what they are, no one style or size fits all
I bought these for my wife to match the color of her new Ipod Nano
She especially liked the fit and they sounded great
Unfortunately after an hour of use one of the speaker stopped working
Doing an exchange and hopethe next pair last longer
Update
The pair lasted a month before one of the speakers quit working
Unfortunately its now outside of the return time period
Life and learn
Won't not recommend these earbuds
Very satisfied
good fit
good sound
Would have preferred a more tangle free cord
Also you really should purchase some sort of case for them to keep from getting knotted up
Certainly not the sound quality you will get with some of the top brands but definitely a nice compliment to an iAnything
We'll see how they hold up to a couple of kids over time but so far so good
The packaging is pretty weak but then I can't complain about the price
Good value
I have no complaints to express about these ear phones
They have excellent sound, durable construction, and the service that was provided by the vendor was first class
I have problem with standard earbuds hurting & constantly falling out
Withadjustable sizes, they fit perfectly & are very comfortable
As a nice bonus, the sound reduction they offer is well done
The set I ordered from Amazon did not work
After problems with the JLab website, I was able to contact their customer service by phone
JLab replaced the earbuds after I mailed them the defective pair
The new ones work fine so far
Needed some earbuds that wouldn't fall out while working out
Sound quality is good for the price you pay, but something is lacking in the mids and highs
Bass is good
it was a very good headphone for its price until it broke 6 days later but the warranty will have it fix
DO NOT BUY THESE
They have very poor sound quality and you can get much better ear phones for less than $5
For the money not bad
You get what you pay for though the sound is really good its the fit thats not great-and the the fact that when nesteled in the ear canal can feel a bit uncomfortable
But when in just right the sound is really good
I gave these to my niece for Christmas who loves them and reports that they work great and fit very comfortably in her ears
She compares them to  her previous headphones stating that while working out at the gym there is no static interference as with her old headphones,  they don't slip out of her ears when sweaty  like her old headphones,  and they  sound is great compared to her old headphones
I do have to say I was a bit disappointed however that they arrived in a bubble wrapped coated brown envelope with not much mail crush protection in my opinion
The other point to be noted is that you will need to buy your own storage case  for these buds as I have found the case  included with my  more expensive earbuds a must for keeping them protected going on 5  years since purchase
Otherwise they would have been flung in a drawer, pocket, brief case or purse  getting twisted amongst other occupants
For the quality and price  however I consider them to be a  good bargain and well worth the extra cost of a case to hold them
If you are thinking about getting this do, it is great and you will be happy with the sound and the quality of the product and it is made very well
After doing some research on Jlabs and these J5 earbuds, it seemed that they packed quite a punch in the quality department
I gave these items as a gift, and after my giftee hesitated to answer my question about the sound quality, I tried them for myself and was absolutely mortified that I had bought such a poor, dry, bass-less sounding product like these J5s
I have a hard time believing that Jlabs would actually sell these if they all sounded like this, so part of me thinks that it was a manufacturer's defect
Seeing that this was the first JLabs product I ever bought, I was not willing to chance it again with a replacement set
I was extremely happy to find ear buds with good sound and a mic for android for my G2, but the mic and button didn't even work
I was quite bummed
Of course the J5M worked on my Blackberry
I even called JBuds to figure out a resolution to get the mic to work with my G2 but they didn't have anything for me
:(  Returned
back on the hunt for a ear buds with mic
I was a huge fan of jlab's j2s, and this one performs even better--great noise isolation, much improved bass
Great quality and worth  more than the price(lightning deal for $19
95)
The only con is that I had to buy the case separately, but worth it nonetheless
Love these earbuds
its has an amazing sound quality and it picks up your voice good even in high volumn areas
I tested this in my work place i barley whispered and it picked up my voice clear but it picks up all sounds too
I love these
I ordered two pair of these thinking that they would work on any cell phone
worked on the iphone but an adapter is needed for the Samsung soltice 887 now I have to try and find one of those
Check for compatibility that meets your needs
ass u me didn't work for me
Otherwise 5*
I have used these headphones for a couple of days I they don't have a good sound quality as I read from other reviews
Actually they are very uncomfortable and it's really difficult to have them on your ears without loosing one them
I bought the headphones to replace my old iPod ones, but I rather stay with those, that have better quality and are more comfortable
A real waste of money
The quality on the J5's is great
I love the look of the sneaker head
I did a few hours of burn-in and am quite satisfied with the sound (though I'm not much of an audiophile)
The fit is OK
I haven't worked out in them yet but they feel like they'll fall out so I may end up buying the around-the-ear adapters
The only real downside is the sound I get through the headphones when the cord touches something
It's loud and common
I wish they came in a case, too (they're folded a few times and twist-tied for storage for now)
Update after 8 months: My left earphone only works when I apply pressure to the back
They've been stored wound up loosely in the small circular JLab case between uses
I'm under warranty (1 year), so we'll see how they handle this situation
If I don't update, assume they handled it satisfactorily and I had nothing to complain about
I got the ear adapters soon after the original purchase, not impressed
Well I bought these headphones as a replacement for my OEM iPhone headphones, the sound quality listening to audio files is great but during phone calls is absolutely horrible, there's a lot of static and for some reason it cuts off my phone calls
I've used several types of the JLab earbuds (J2's, J3's, BOQARI Q1, and now the J5's)
I have to say that the J5 earbuds have the combined qualities of the BOQARI Q1's and the J3's
The J5's have the excellent clarity of the BOQARI Q1's but keep the low end bass response of the J3's
These J5's fit and are as comfortable as the J3's
I haven't even "burned" them in yet and they sound terrific
They are now my all time favorite earbuds
I'll wait  to see how durable these J5's are and will update at  a later time after the "burn in"
So far---good job JLab Audio
I normally don't write reviews on products, but these are so good that I wanted to add my comments
I'll keep it short and sweet
I received these as a gift from my wife because I left a different pair of headphones on a plane recently
I travel alot so the microphone feature comes in very handy when walking through airports
I definitely recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a really good pair of headphones without breaking the bank
If I'm going to be donating these to the next guy in 9D I don't want to be spending crazy money
I have to admit I am quite picky when it comes to earbuds
I am not talking audio fidelity, just simply price, comfort, sound quality, and durability
Certainly there are some amazing earbuds out there, however, I don't have $200+ to drop on one pair
This is my third pair of J-Buds and I am extremely happy
Originally I purchased the J2's which had pretty good sound quality and were really value priced
Build quality left something to be desired but hey for the price not bad
Then I got the J3's and to be honest they sucked haha
Terrible quality and just an all around awful product
As for this pair I am happy to report the quality seems to be quite good
Again, not amazing but for the price, very acceptable
The sound quality also seems to be good to me (plenty of bass and clear sound)
Also the earbuds are very comfortable
I got them on a gold box discount and only paid $19
95 so I would say that they are awesome
Pros:Good sound qualityComfortableRelatively durableCons:None really, not the highest build quality but as I said in the pros definitely not a con thus far
For only $19
99 from lightning deal, you will be very hard pressed to find better sounding buds
I havent had them burnt in
But mids and lows are very good out of the box, highs's a little muffled, but will get better over time
It definitely outperforms SONY's bland yet much more expensive EX310($60)
Great budget product
The only gripe, just like others have said, is that these buds produce crackling noise when you move or refit them in your ears
These buds are open, which means you share with surroundings what you hear, so it's not for library/quiet-room use
PS: I came from Shure SE 535 before making this comment
This is a pretty good headset, it works great
but I cannot give 5 stars because it didn't come with a case
for this price I would expect it will come with a case, or at least with a resealable bag
First off, I'd like to point out that I purchased these for 20$ during the lightning deal
The 10$ difference between 20$ and 30$ for earbud headphones is pretty big imo
I tried these on and right out of the bag to see how they were
They were really muddy, and sounded muffled, just as I expected
I burned them in using their burn-in player located: [
]
A total of 30 hours using this website and also 10-15 hours on my iPod playing pink/white noise
The difference was very noticeable
The muddy-ness was still evident, but barely
I expect it to go away after some use
These are not as bass heavy as a lot of sennheisers are
Also, these are not as clear as a pair of klipsch that I have
These J5's are a combination of both clean strong bass, yet clear vocals that you can expect from earbuds at this price point
The build overall is very solid
The perks of creating an earbud with metal
When you have it in your hand, it definitely is heavier than non-metal earbuds, but the weight difference doesn't really matter once it's in your ear
I can see this pair going through heavy use and still be solid
The wire is better than most, but still tangles and is fairly easy to untangle
I wish it was more the cx series sennheiser wires
Those are easy to untangle
Cons: For earbuds at this price point, I wanted more sizes of silicon
There exists a void between M and small that I and many others (I assume) prefer
The wires, as explained above
The size of the splitter, a tad big than needed, but I understand it's there for more support and strength
Now, back to the price point
I gave this 5 stars because of the price which I got it for, 20$
If I had purchased this for 30$ (which I probably wouldn't), I'd give this 4 stars
These earbuds are very respectable due to it's solid build, looks, and performance
The J5's, to me, beat out most of the sennheisers being sold on Amazon for the same price range
Be sure to burn them in once you get your pair
Excellent pair of headphones
They have great sound, good bass, and fit comfortably
Shipping was unbelievable as usual with Amazon
Ordered on the 21st and arrived today on the 24th
Love the buds and Amazon continues to impress
I've recently received these in the mail and despite using them right away (and not doing a "burn-in" that some other reviewers have deemed "necessary"), they offered a fantastic sealed-in (what you want from noise-isolating buds) sound with deep bass and zero distortion when increasing the volume on iTunes
Structurally, the buds are very strong
I tend to wrap my wires around my iPod, causing the wire at the elbow joint on the audio jack to fray after only a few months
The JBud 5s have a hardened, reinforced elbow that protects against that kind of wear
Also, other reviewers have pointed out the "thin wire" that's thinner than the JBud 4 model; trust me, the JBud 5 wire is pretty thick and robust
I'm a long distance runner so I need a strong set of earbuds since I run every day with my iPod
The separator between the right and left ear wires is far enough down from my chin that no snags ever occur while running or otherwise
If I had to include a negative, and I'm really reaching here, it's that the wire is long and may snag on desk items if you're only using them at your desk at work
Honestly, I like how long they are because my iPod sits comfortably in my running shorts with even the deepest pockets and there's never any pull or snag
Steal at $30
Paid $25 for these on a special sale and definitely worth it
I don't like the super high end models as I usually break these
I use them on my iPod and computer
Excellent
Would have been better with a case, but great earbuds
i ordered the j5 earbuds off of amazon and couldn't wait to get them
When they finally came 1st thing i noticed is they were not the color i ordered
i even checked the packing slip and i was right
they shipped the wrong ones
i was willing to deal with the color i got then i noticed that the screen on one of the buds was missing
So i go to amazon to exchange for a new pair and i'm told that i can't get an exchange cuz they are out of stock of everything
i'm not real happy about this
I have been buying earbuds for years and i have tried many different companies these JBuds are very well Hi-Fi quality and don't feel let down by the packaging
There worth every dollar they feel great and they don't weigh down your ears i really love these earbuds the sound quality is far better than V-Moda could ever sound
These are very competable with the SkullCady brand, When i recieved mine they do not feel cheap what so ever and the cord is very straight and not easy to get tangled
These are the easyiest earbuds to deal with that i have had
I will buy another pair of these or any other kind from JBud
If i could think of one think bad about these wonderful earbuds would have to be the tip designs and that the (Db) level is kinda low and you have to turn your volume up a little higher to hear it loud
But these are comfortable earbuds and have good quality all around
Surprisingly, my last two sets of these ear buds have broken
The first time was at the jack where the plastic meets the metal
I have no idea how it happened but one day it just separated so that only the wires were keeping it together
Eventually, they stopped working
However I was still under warranty at the time so they were easily replaced
The second set split at the metal microphone part
One day, sound stopped coming from that earbud and it was because the wires had broken
However, this time the warranty was up, so now I'm debating getting another pair or going for another brand
These sound great, but they break way to easily with little abuse
They are reinforced, so it may just have been my bad luck that gave me two defective earbuds
These headphones have been great
I've owned for about a month and everything sounds amazing
I previously owned a pair of the VModa ear-buds which I thought were a little bit more comfortable and provided more bass, however after going through 3 pairs of those because of cheap wiring and the sound dying out on them I decided to make a switch to these and I've been very happy with the purchase
The plug seems very strong in comparison and I think it being angled will really help keep a strong connection
The only reason I take off a star is because for me the fit is a tad uncomfortable, I had to use the smallest earplugs to get them to stay in my ears, while still making the "sound seal" that you want with ear-buds
That said I do wear these headphones for countless hours during the day, and they don't bother me a vast majority of the time
They work great for running and working out and in my opinion (poor college kid) the price is right
Overall a great product, would buy again, but sure hope I won't have to
These are the worst Earbuds I have ever owned
They wont stay pluged in to my Nano or my Classic
Ive tried them on other Ipods that were new, and other Nanos that friends own
They keep commingout of the socket
So, either the ones that I bought here were defects, or they are just crap
Im in Afganistan and have no way of returning them
I had to buy another set
This time Skull Candy
These were a ripoff big time
In addition to all of this, the earbuds themselves dont stay in my ear during my workout in the gym
One little brush of cord and they come out of the ear
Like I said, these are the worst
Ok, so the sound quality with these earbuds is the best you can possibly get at 30 Dollars
But the problem is the cable
Every single time the cable rubs on any thing or moves, you can definitely hear it
It is way too sensitive, so if you are planning to walk or go to the Gym with these, I would not recommend them
But of course if you are just going to use them for casual listening at home, these earbuds are great and well worth it
Just one more problem with the cable is that after just a few days of light usage, it seems like the black color of the cable is going away
I really like these earbuds not only for the sound and quality but for the fact that they actually stay in my ears
The earbuds come with different sizes so that you can find the perfect fit
I have purchased many earbud headphones in the past and I have never found a set that worked for me
I am not a "sound pefectionist" but I love the sound these earbuds put out so for me I give them 5 stars for great sound and great fit
plus they look very sleek
I don't consider myself audiophile, but it looks like these ear buds will turn me into one
I purchased the J5 ear buds based on the previous user reviews; and am very satisfied with it so far
The bass is amazing considering the size of the earphones
The J5 ear-buds are a snug fit with the medium-sizes buds
The good thing is that they come with 4 sizes; so at least one should fit anyone
They sound incredibly loud and clear considering they are under $30 ear phones
The build quality seems pretty good
I love the color combination of "Sneaker head"
The only down-side I see is no case
But IMHO, I don't need it personally, since they are always on my ears :)I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for good, decent sound for about 30 bucks and does not need a case
Price:At a regular price of close to $60 (Amazon's price was $30), these aren't cheap by any means, but they do perform very well
Background Noise:They are my first set that actually enter the ear canal, which blocks out a decent amount of background noise
I haven't had a chance to use them on an airplane yet, but they did a great job on a road trip I took
I spent a lot of time on dirt roads, and they blocked out almost all of the noise from the rocks hitting the vehicle
Sound:Overall sound is decent, nothing spectacular, but nothing terrible either
It's just a good all around sound
Wow, these sound great
Excellent bass and treble response, with emphasis on the bass where it should be
I got a "Lightning Deal" on these at Amazon which makes it even better
Highly recommended
I have recently received it and I am loving it so far
I love the idea that there is more than one sized tip included in the packaging
There is no case included with this headphone
The sound quality is quite good, and I do not have to turn up the volume on my ipod to get a decent sound
For $30, it is a good headphone for the price
I would definitely recommend it
The JBuds J5's are the best pair of earbuds I've ever owned
I'm no sound freak, but I know good sound when I hear it
Also comes with different tip sizes
The J5's are a real bargain, with superior sound and excellent build quality
Update 3, final review - 1 Week after buying
These headphones are decent, with the sound quality being just as good as a pair of $150 Sony's, if not better (Though with my set the sound seems to be more prominent in the left bud, rather than centred
Quite irritating)
The cord is nice and rigid, but still soft enough to move around freely
The biggest problem with these headphones however, is the fact that they just don't sit in my ear properly
This problem is so big that I've updated my review from a 4/5 star to a 1/5 star
The 'medium' sized buds slip out, as do the large ones
It's not due to my 'ear hole' being really big, as the isolating buds from my Sony headphones are the same size as the medium from the J5's and it fits perfectly
Not really sure what's going on there, but it seems to be the same for a few people
Basically if you're planning on doing any kind of movement while wearing these, I'd suggest buying a different set
Hell, all I need to do is yawn slightly and these fall out of my ear
For the price
Okay, they might seem appealing
The reality
You'll just find yourself buying another set and throwing these out
My final statement is simple, don't bother buying
Overall, 1/5
After using some JVC marshmallows for years I decided to get something different
I really didn't know what direction to go in, but I did know I wanted a mic on my headphone and them to be in-ear
So I started to look around and stumbled upon these, and Im glad I did
The build quality is really good and they look appealing
Also the fit is good too, nice and tight  with little to no outside noise
The mic is good also no problems with it and the button was nice to have, even though there was no volume switch on it (something that is not a big deal)  Now to the important part
the sound
they sound really good, the first thing i noticed about the sound was the amount of bass and the detail of the bass
Also they are loud and everything just sounds clear and all my music just sounded different (in a good way) after the headphones
I definatly suggest them, especially at the price they are at
For $20-30, this is a great deal
They are definitely an upgrade from the J3s which were really small and weak
The sound, I can't notice much of a difference but overall a pretty good buy if you just want standard in ear headphones with a little bit extra bass
UPDATE: After 6 months of use, the outer ring had become loose and I contacted JLAB immediately
They sent a brand new pair in just a week
They have truly amazing customer service and any of their products are a must buy
I got these today
The color of the pink lemonade is more pink than it looks (which I like)
They fit well in my ears and have good sound
I hate how earphones make the background noise when you move (ususally the wires rubbing as you move) and these still do that which is why I only gave them 4 stars
Of course I don't want to spend very much on earphones because I will eventually lose them
The cord is not too thin or too thick, not sure why this is a previous complaint but they seem very durable and lightweight at the same time
I love the 45 degree angle on the input
I am less likely to get it snagged
I am conflicted on the packaging
in one way I am happy I didn't have to work to get them out of that bubble packaging but then the little plastic bag they came in was not very protective
If they crap out on me before I lose them I will come back and let you know
:-)
I bought these headphones and have had them for at least a month now and after using them for a while and reading the other reviews, I think the other reviews give too much hype to these buds
They are good headphones and the pricing is good, but they aren't that much better than the regular stock iPhone headphones
They are barely a step up quality-wise, because they are not that much noticeably better
They offer great noise-isolating sound which can get annoying at times, but if you want noise-isolation, they are great
The microphone control button isn't all to special and it's debatable of whether it's worth the extra 5 bucks or not because the button control only allows for pause/play and next track/previous track features
In other words, it doesn't allow for the user to control the volume which for me was a problem
Overall, for the price, they're a good pair of buds, but don't expect them to blow you away
These JBuds J5s are an excellent combination of style and functionality
I was contemplating buying BOSE IE2s and then decided on these earphones
The packaging is great as they give you multiple ear buds(diffferent sizes) as a clip with a 360 angle swivel
So far so good
I have owned many of the JBuds models including the JBuds, J2, J3, J4 (gift to a relative), the BOQARI Q1 and now the J5
I was so impressed with the J3 that I have purchased many sets to gift to those on my Christmas list
The J5 has a sleeker designed housing but it delivers an improved bass response without distortion over the J3
I use them with an iPod and I import all the music to iTunes at the higher quality 192 kbps MP3 setting for better playback thru headphones and home stereo systems
From the very first listening with the J5
I am totally impressed with the sound performance and the bass response for a headphone that can be purchased for $29
95 (I purchased the J5 for $24
95 on Dec
9)
Sadly, I returned these earbuds
The reception was quite good but the sound of the cables brushing across my clothes was transmitted very noticeably to the earbuds
I could even tap the cables and hear the movement
Very disappointing
I've ordered two of these
For the first, right out of the package one ear had a loose wire and only played about 20% of the time, depending on the position of the wire
I returned it and asked for a replacement
It came, and within one hour of use at moderate volume, one ear picked up a loud rattling buzz whenever a track hit a peak (and by "track" I mean, people having a conversation in a podcast)
Needless to say, I will not ask for a third replacement
The earbuds have a sleek look and sound quality is a premium sound
Would purchase this product again price was very reasonable
I buy nothing but $20-$30 headphones
The sound on these was decent, the highs weren't very clear even for the price
Unfortunately they broke after one week
Needless to say,  I won't be buying them again
Bought it for $25 when it's on sale
The sound is nice and clear, good replacement for the iphone headphone
The audio quality is amazing
Yet, I have two complaints:1: When the cord rubs against anything it makes a weird noise2: My left ear-bud started fading in and out randomly after only a week of having these headphones
Sounded great for music
But would not work for phone calls
Complete static or glitching during phone calls using the mic
JLab said I was shipped a defective headset and that I should return it
I hope to update this with a new set
But my first impressions when compared to the $79 apple in head phones
The JLab's mic is too low
If you put the cord down your shirt for exercising, the mic is inside your shirt where you sweat and it will not work for phone calls while you walk or ride a bike
I'd suggest moving the mic up higher near the mouth like Apple's
The fit was decent, the build looked good expect that mine was broken out of the box
This headset doesn't have volume control like the Apple ones
I look the appearance of these but I'm not sure I want to spend the $ and give them another shot when the Apple-In-ear headphones are designed better
I was just looking for a cheaper version and I not sure these are it yet
The J5's are a very solid earbud headphone
I'm not an audiophile, but the sound seems very good with a full range
Wires seem like standard earbud gauge so they should be durable enough: caveat, I've only been using them for a few weeks but so far no problems
Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is that the plug is a 45� plug
Not sure if that is mentioned in the product description
I prefer straight line or 90� plugs, but that's a personal preference
Overall very good headphones and the $30 price seems pretty much on the money
So disappointed
I've had JBuds before and liked them, but these newer ones have the fatal flaw of picking up noise from the cord bouncing against or touching your clothing or earrings as you walk
I saw that a jogger reported in a review that he had a problem with this, but I took a chance since I would only be walking with them, not high impact bouncing around
Even casually walking, they are basically unusable-- they are fine if you are sitting still and the cord is touching nothing
But not useful to me
I have had these earbuds since 12/6/11, so it has been a week of me having it in this review
I so far love these headphones
When I am useing these earbuds, I cannot hear other people, and I listen to music at a fairly low volume, so these have a good noise cancellation
The sound on this is very high quality, and its a extremely noticeable difference than those cheaper run-of-the-mill earbuds
When I use the microphone while I am talking to my friends on my phone, they can't tell that I am using earbuds, as the microphone is really good on this
I love these earbuds, and the only thing I am not completely satisfied with is the design, as I find the J3Ms had the best design out of all of these earbuds from Jlab
As a bit of a preface, I tend to work in environments that are noisy, and the work I do leans towards long periods of concentration to maintain productivity
For this reason, I choose to keep music playing at almost all times
I have used many different kinds of headphones in my several years as an audio freak, going from giant over-the-ear bass boosters to hilariously intrusive canalphones
For convenience, seal, and price, I have found JBuds to rarely disappoint
What is more, they are surprisingly rugged (in my experience), and take the abuse I randomly dole out rather well
To break it down simply:PROS:- Impressive seal that allows you to listen to music lower and still hear more
This is important to me, as this causes the earbuds to function like portable ear plugs that shoot the wonderful tunes right into my ear, just the way I like it
- Not intrusive at all, and quite a comfortable fit
This prevents what some call "ear fatigue," or a pain that develops from having earbuds or canalphones in too long
I experienced this with the J4s, but the shape of the J5s are much more kind to me
- Sound range is very good for the price range
Keep in mind that while these may seem expensive, they are only mid-range for LOW-END headphones
The bass bumps a respectable amount, and the treble is crisp
It helps tons if you use your EQ intelligently, but these work well enough even on Windows Media Player
CONS:- Much like the J3s, these earbuds will seem to "short" if there is pressure placed on them from the outside while they are being worn
Typically not an issue, but if you are in bed or leaning your head sideways against a chair, if just about anything touches your ear, the seal will be messed and the sound will be ruined until the pressure is removed
- A lot of transferrence of external inertial noise through the wire
I forget the exact term for this, but it comes down to being able to hear any rubbing or bumping against the headphone wires
Mind you, this is a common failing of ALL in-ear headphones, and is generally something you will learn to ignore
I'm not sure why a case would be any sort of deal breaker or decision maker, but I will note that it made no difference to me, as I use the epic carrying pack that came with my J4s
In closing: JBuds are far from perfect products, and I would always caution a buyer to do their research on what kind of headphone is best for you
However, for their price and durability, I prefer no other types of headphones more when on the go
PROS:Very good sound quality, strong bass
CONS:Any sort of rubbing/contact with the cord causes VERY LOUD noise in the headphones
I tried workout out with them, and it was very annoying
I cannot recommend using these headphones unless you are sitting still, even wearing them just walking around is not pleasant due to these noises
I will stick with my Sennheiser 380's for the gymEarbud material not very comfortable, and feels somewhat cheap and stiff
The extra large buds are HUGE
I usually wear XL but these are just a bit too big
However the normal large is a bit too small, so I ended using some extra earbuds I had from another set, which fit pretty well
OVERALL:Good value for the 19
95 lightning deal, however material quality (cord, earbuds) is lacking
I will just be using these at work in my cubicle
For 30 dollars, I would recommend getting a pair of Sennheiser's
I was looking for a new headphone because I was tired of the ones that came with my iPod
After searching and reading many of reviews, I finally decided to purchase JBuds J5 Earbuds
I will say this
I am happy with the J5 earbuds
After putting the xsmall buds on, I put them in my ears and they were comfortable
I slept with them on all night
It blocks out most of the outside noise which I love because now I can enjoy my music without hearing all the extras
To me, the sound is amazing
The bass is on point which I like
I now hear sounds, etc in songs that I didn't hear before when I was listening with the ipod headphones
I will buy JBuds product again
These earbuds come with a great sound, slim design that fits nicely in your ears, and a pretty decent microphone
In fact, the only real issue with these earbuds is that the cord puts a lot of noise into your ears (stethescope effect) when you are mobile
Of course, if you plan to sit while you use these it isn't an issue
I got these for work, where I set 8+ hours a day, so for me they are perfect
But, I couldn't give them 5 stars because it annoys me to get up just to walk to refill the coffee
can't imagine trying to run with them in your ears
So
if you are going to be using these while stationary (flights, train rides, cubicle) they are a GREAT buy
just avoid if you are getting them for active use
**UPDATE**Had these for a couple months and they are already blown
:(  I don't listen very loudly
I'm going to go through and try to use the warranty
I'll report back
For the price you can't go wrong
They sound great and are built very good
I'm no expert in sound like some of the reviews I have read, but I have been playing music on and off for over 40 years so I do know a little about tone,mids,highs,and bass
These headphones touch on all 4
Not too much on any one
For me they are just right
And for the price you can't go wrong
I have a pair of Bose that I paid over a $100 for and they suck compared to these
And they arrived 2 days early
I am very satisfied, and yes I would buy another pair
excelent product durable and sound great cant get much better for the price I would purchase these agian
I had a problom before with them folling out with a different product but these work great and you cant hear much of anything with them on only the music
If you are "upgrading" from J3s, be aware that it doesn't feel like an upgrade
Was shocked that a case is not included
it didn't say there was, but family members and I have five pairs of JBuds J3 and let's just say it's an expectation (reasonable or not)
The phones seem pretty good (still breaking them in) so we'll see
Don't forget to play at high volume for 24-48 hours
Also, the J3 has a raised letter on the left bud so I can tell which ear in low light
Not so on the J5 - both feel the same
Buy the J3, get a tangle free, sturdy cord, neck tension adjuster, tactile marking on ear buds, and a free case
JLab J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones with Travel Case - Jet Black
I have personally bought 4 pairs of JLabs Jbuds, from the Jbuds all the way to the J4's
I had originally bought them for the colors and the price, but after hearing what they'll do, I can't bring myself to buy anything else
I usually rock a $50 pair of Sony buds, but after getting the J5's, I really have no use for them
These things are more comfortable than every other set of buds I've ever had
These things are very well worth the price
If you're looking for comfort, sound quality, volume, clarity, bass and really nice style, these are the way to go
The small cord is an added bonus for me also, I hate a thick cord weighing down the buds and pulling out of my ears
I haven't put them through the standard 24 hour break in period the other Jbuds need, but I'm not even noticing that they actually need it
I've only had them in my ears for a short time and have already had multiple eargasms
These buds are absolutely amazing, affordable, and what everyone on my Christmas list is getting
Bought these earbuds as a birthday gift for my husband and he has been very pleased so far
I had never head of JLab before, but the reviews were pretty good on Amazon and the price was right
He has no complaints and says the sound is as good as or better than any other earbud he has owned
Will give JLab another look for sure in the future
These earbuds are the best bang for the buck
The sound is crystal clear and the bass is decent for a pair of earbuds
The only problem I have with it is the cable
Whenever you move the cable around, the sound transmit to the earbuds which could be annoying at times if you are moving and you hear "thud thud thud thud
" I wish they could fix this problem by using some other material which doesn't make noise when the cable is moved
Other than that, I'm very happy with my purchase
Need to burn them in and the quality would probably be even better
Just got these headphones this morning af I already notice that they block outside noise better than the SonyHeadphones I replaced that were about the same price
Sound quality is good although I'm not an audiophile or anything
Currently using it with my iPhone and sound is good
I do notice a slight thumping when I jog in place but I might justBe overconscious
The biggest con I've notice is a crackling noise when I put them in my ear
Probably part of metalheadphones but it's a tad creepy
The sound happens when I move the earbud so I guess I won't be sleeping in these
I'll update the review later if the sound goes away or gets worse
Otherwise, once they're in your ears, everything is fine
The JBuds J5 Earbuds are the best sounding and best fitting earbuds that I have tried
They work perfectly with the Kindle Fire
They worked in both ears when I got them
But the sound quality is bordering on terrible
There is no audible distortion but the sound is very tinny without any bass or depth
I would not recommend these earbuds even for casual use
Better to pass on these failures and get a different pair that are the same price or cheaper, they are likely to sound much better
I did have high hopes for these since the JBuds J2s were fairly good quality for a cheap price
I used them in cases where they were more likely to get broken (like when falling asleep) and not feel too bad (not like sacrificing a pair of Klipsh or Senheisser earbuds)
Using the J5s make me feel bad even though they are working
After reading all the other rave reviews I started thinking that maybe it was just me that was having problems with bad sound quality, but my wife got a separate set and she is having the same issue
So unless they both were from the same bad batch I'm not getting it
Recieved these buds as a gift and was please with the cool look
I travel a lot and after a long flight my ears didn't hurt
The sound quality was crisp and they blocked out the quite a bit of the ambiant noise
Overall very pleased with this product and most of Jlab's merchandise
I got these J5's to replace some of the Skull Candy ear buds that I'd grown tired of
I am really happy with the purchase
The thin wires alone are worth it
I am not a fan of bulky wires because I travel quite a bit, and these wires are thin and flexible
I should probably also mention that the sound quality on these ear buds are as great as advertised
Its pretty simple, they are worth every penny
These are good, they just sound flatter/less dynamic then my J3's do
Combine with the J3's come with a case and thicker cord, ten dollars more in price, and this is actually an expensive "down grade" for someone
I tested using an iPod touch, flat mix, equal volume
The J3's just sounded better and were also louder with more bass
Equally sized ear canal inserts were used
One positive is the J5 seems to stay in my ears better then the J3 when I exercise
I'll keep them (J5) for back ups, and I prefer the "ear bud" style headphone to the stock in your ear iPod headphone
All in all a decent ear bud, just not as good IMHO as the J3s
Link for the j3:JLab J3 Micro Atomic In-Ear Earphones with Travel Case - Jet Black
I just got my first set of J5s and they are good
So far I have fond many things about them that I thing a buyer should know
Pros: The sound is good with very good base and sound but, this is only after the J5s recive a fourty hour burn in causing the buds to work at full power
Another pro is that the buds are light weight and comfortable which means unlike the J4s they wont fall out durning running or working out,Cons: the base is good but other sound qualities could be a little better for $30  no case, which i would recomend buying because the wire could rip in your pocket or jacket
i recently purchased this pair of jbuds due to the quality provided by the previous models
it seems that this new j5 model has worked out many of the problems with the previous models
the earbud is no longer heavy due to the metal composite (like the j4) but is still maintains a metal shell
the sound quality is amazing with a clear bass too
the track control is a nice feature too
track control instructions:1 press- pause/play/answer call/hang up
2 press- skip song
3 press- previous song
tips:like any other buds, keep them safe and dont handle these roughly
it only takes a a quick accidental yank to ddestroy ANY pair of buds
keep them safe and they will serve you for at least 8 months
I received the JBuds and was happy about the packaging because it was frustration free
I can't stand the hard plastic that comes with other headphones
I usually end up cutting my finger
The headphones came with different size earbuds
The earbuds really make snug fit inside your ear so you can hear just the music not the surrounding noise
I used these headphones this past weekend as I cut my lawn and I could not hear the lawnmower
All music which is a good thing
The fit and the ability to block out the surrounding noise is better than my Sony MDR-EX71SL and my Motorola SD-9 HD Bluetooth headphones
I don't even use the headphones that came with my iphone
I can't see myself spending $100 on Dre's headphones
This is a must buy
You won't be sorry
I hope they make some bluetooth headphones in the future
For now, I more curious about their swimming headphones, JLAB Wave
That will be my next purchase
If they are anything like these headphones, I will be extremly happy when I swim my laps
Will review them when I get them
This is my second pair of Jlab headphones and I'm really liking the brand so far
The build quality is good, sound is nice and balanced and they offer a wide range of styles and designs (I also have the J
Fi Wood headphones)
For roughly $30 (Amazon Prime price, anyway), this is a great way to upgrade the sound on any laptop or mobile device
I've been testing these on my iPhone 4 with the Rdio subscription service, as well as the iPod, and so far so good
I have the "Sneaker Head" color and they really give it a nice, contemporary look; somewhat similar to what you might find in a Beats by Dre product, but at a lower cost
I also like the graphite, but there are color options for men and women
This is also great for pairing with color iPods
Smart idea
These come with four tips, compared to the J
Fi's seven, to really help find the best size
In comparison, my Senns only came with three and only one is even close to fitting
I think JLab really hit the mark by adding more sizing options
Kudos
This company just continues to excel in quality
I started with original jbuds, moved onto the JBud 3's in which I purchased 4 pairs
Quality is just incredible over earbuds or headphones up to 5 times there costs
Now I was fortunate to recieve a pair of JBud J5's, these are even better yet
Do not take my comment lightly, if you're looking for quality and cost is a priority along with quality sound
Then you only have one thing left, purchase a pair, you won't regret your choice
Thanks JLab
I've been looking for a pair of buds that fit seamlessly in my ear without eventually irritating me
As a professional with a long commute twice a day, style comfort and sound in a bud are key
I have found what i was looking for in jlabs j5ms
These buds sound and feel as good as they look
In this price point, they can't be beat
I got myself a pair of the j5 and I was blown away by the quality of the great fit, the sound
The fit of these earbuds is awesome
The sound is amazing and build quality is solid
They are also amazing for blocking outside noise
A good buy for 29
95
Out of the package these look a lot like the j3s but in a great new package
It's like a foil bag that you just rip open
The 45 degree angle plug isn't quite as good as a 90 but it's an improvement
The stress pints on the cable are beefed up compared to the j3s but not as bulky as the j4s
The wire is plenty long and seems very delicate and its rubbery feeling instead of slick like the j3s
Most of my jbuds last 3 -6 months so we'll wait and see
The mic is in a great place, it's closer to the y in the cable and just feels better using the control functions
They changed their warranty and it sucks now
If you're looking for the best warranty it's skullcandy HANDS DOWN
These are SUPER comfortable, hardly notice them in my ear
The tips are soft
They feel light in your ears
no tugging or fatigue
I really like the grill on the back
Gives them a good look in your ears
Also great for sleeping because they don't stick out too far
As for the sound its very good
Very warm sound and crisp highs
Didn't notice any mixing of the mids and bass like the j3s but I haven't been using these long
So far seems very balanced and clear
If these had a lifetime warranty like skullcandy these would be 5 stars
Update 12-8-11 After a good 40 hour burn in the sound is quite stunning
They claim 23khz as the high end and you can tell
The highs are very crisp
The separation of the highs, mids, and bass are quite amazing for buds in this price range
They honestly sound as good as my klipsch image s4s
Def a good buyUpdate 1-15-12 I've had these less than 2 months and the left earbud tube literally separated from the housing
I have kept these in a samba case at all times and only use them at home
In other words they were well taken care of
The buds still function but when I pull them out of my ears the left one separates
I am going to try their warranty process but my expectations are low
I've had bad experiences with jlab in the recent past
I've heard from friends and here in the reviews that they often reject your return saying nothing is wrong
Guess we'll see
I'll update when I get through the warranty process
Gotta drop the rating a star for durability
If they mess with me on the warranty it'll drop another
I uploaded 2 photos so you could see what happened Update 1-28-12 Went thru the warranty process and received my replacements fairly quickly
It cost $4 to ship in the defects
Only thing that would have made it better was if they'd have let me pick a diff color like skullcandy does
Update 7-9-12 Thought it was worth noting the control functions do not work with my android device running 2
2(froyo)
They do work with my device running 2
3(gingerbread)
So I assume if you're running 2
3 or later you'll be good
I just got a pair of J5s and have been really impressed with the quality of the build
I have owned a lot of headphones before from all the major brands and have kind of stuck on JLab products because a) I don't like waiting in line at stores so I buy everything on Amazon and b) Jbuds are typically the least expensive decent quality earbuds on here
I go through my buds pretty quickly as I bring them everywhere with me and usually wind up leaving them somewhere eventually
I was a big fan of the J4s and have a couple pairs of those
I liked the durability and the sound clarity was great
For my most recent purchase, I decided to try the newer version because they were a bit cheaper and I didn't need a case
Here are my initial thoughts:Pros:Sound quality- These are some of the best headphones I have ever owned for clarity of the music
I feel like I do not have to turn my iphone volume as loud as with other buds to get a decent volume level
Also, at the louder volumes, there is no distortion
This has been a problem in the past with other earphones I have used
Look and feel great- I am a fan of the rounder tear drop shape of the buds
I prefer this over some of the boxier earbuds or the ones that look like they come from another planet
The J5s are super comfortable in your ears and you can wear them all day without any discomfort
The grill on the back is cool and is a nice touch
The jack- JLAB has restyled the jack and the new one feels really solid and well constructed
Cons:No case- The J5s do not come with a case
This was not a big deal for me as I have a couple extra
I think that you can buy the case separate if this is important for you
Thinner cable- The cable on the J5s is thinner than the J4s
This is a better design if you need it for running or when you are on the move but some people might prefer the heavier cable
Conclusion:The J5s are the best sounding buds I have ever used and it is pretty incredible that they only cost $30
If you want a thicker cable and case, look into the more expensive J4s though
When I ordered this product I ordered two pairs at once so when a year from now one of them finally broke I would have a back up (because that's how skull candy ear buds work for me)
Sadly, that wasn't the case
I placed a review not too long after I ordered about how great they were, but I kind of wish I had waited longer
Overall the sound quality is pretty good initially, especially for the price, but it didn't take too long before the first pair I opened started to get lower sound quality and eventually no sound all together in the left ear, then damage to the casing holding the ear buds together, then diminished quality in the right ear as well
I had hoped that the first pair was just bad luck on my part, but the second pair I opened STARTED with the left ear not getting any sound
I really hate leaving 1 star feedback so I guess I should leave the few pros
this product did ship quickly, and despite the problems with the sound from the ear buds the microphone continues to work flawlessly
Really sorry seller, but I will NOT be recommending this product :(
I like to  fall asleep to music with earbuds in to drown out my neighbors
These didn't last a month with such use
I like Skullcandy headphones, and I was just looking for a pair of earbuds so I could listen to music when I'm in bed
These get the job done, but they don't sound as good as other Skullcandy products
I've purchased Skullcandy headphones for under $20 and the sound was satisfying, so I know not all low priced headphones will be disappointing
Pros :Skullcandy headphones come with a warrantyCons :Sound quality is unimpressive
The sound quality is not as good as expected but is worth buying something the will last you a couple of month
Great sound
great speakers
This wasn't what I was expecting
One of the buds came with a defective cover and it feels like a little cable or resistance is loose inside, so it feels a little energy discharge in the right ear everytime I put it
Now, it's too late to change it since I'm in Venezuela
If you're thinking about buying this product, think twice, you will receive poor/defective quality for your money
works great so far
the last one I ordered lasted about two weeks
They worked well for a while until they started sending electrical pulses through my brain
I take very good of my electronics so when it started shocking me I was shocked
I would guess every 10 minutes or so it happens
I would spend a few extra dollars on something that won't hurt you and will last a lot longer
Just received my headphones and only 1 of the ear buds actually works
Good
I've been using Skullcandy headphones for years, but this pair in particular broke after two months
The sound quality is great, but I'd be careful when purchasing
Broke after a month of use
Very dissapointed
Pros:Great fit, improved cord, still good for the price
The cord on the pair I recieved is flat and rubbery, not braided as described in the listing
Cons:Straight plug, 'Supreme Sound', require equaliserThese earphones have crisp bass, flat mids, and sharp highs- which is great if you like those descriptions
I dislike all three
I used to buy Scullcandy specifically because they avoided all three
If you are familiar with the older Ink'd line, do not expect these to sound the same
The bass is not boosted, the mids are not expansive, and the highs are annoyingly piercing
Not as painful as other 'audiophile' earphones I have, but definitely not what I was expecting
They CAN produce fantastic sound, which I can tweak if I have access to a decent equaliser
I buy in-ears for travel, though, and my portables have terrible equalisers
I need in-ears to sound at least near my preferences out-of-the-box
Three stars because they are still great earphones
You may like the new sound stage better
I will be giving mine away
stunning sound, great noise cancellation, and durability
finally great sound for a affordable price
i bought mine 4 months ago and use them everyday and don't hear a major decrease in the sound quality
These come with two sets of silicone earbuds and of course the larger ones are on it when it's packaged, which are FAR too large for me
One of the small silicone earbuds is ripped
I thought I would just use one from an old broken pair but I cannot get the small ones on the earbud posts at all and cannot get the large ones back on to ship it back
I'm so frustrated
I haven't even used them yet because of this
work great and arrived on time
thanks
The sound is wonderfull
Awesome And Worth The Price
Good
Amazing
The mic works & activates right away
& good clear sound
Working perfectly thus far :) I love skull candy~
I ordered 2
Both of them were defected
One was having issues with the earphone and the other was having bad microphone
Returned both of them
Clean clear sound, I would recommend
It broke in 2 weeks
Great deal
I think it was just these earphones or maybe the color I bought them in but if u get them in black and white the sound is crisp,material of the earphone feels comfortable while in your ear, these are uncomfortable I definitely will not be purchasing these again
I hate my headphones
Not loud at all and my mic does not work
That's how I got them
The only reason I bought was for the mic
Very unhappy
The rubber material that the wires are made from get caught on EVERYTHING
The pair received were knockoffs
The packaging was different with the fonts on the package incorrect with a dot over the y that shouldn't be there, no L or R on the bud, and the mic on wrong side
Great sound quality but after about 3 days they broke so that i have to mes with the audio plug before it sounds like its supposed to
All time worst purchase from Amazon
It bro right out of the package it doesn't work on my phone nor my tablet it is complete trash
Great sound
Shipped fast
If your ear buds break skullcandy has a LIFETIME warranty
Go to their site and if you didnt break them you can get new headphones of equal value
One of the greatest headphones when I get my ps4 fixed I cant wait to use them they are loud to be advised
I had a similar pair that I broke, so I bought these
They block out ambient noise but not as much as my first pair, which is a good thing if you want to be able to keep them in your ears but still notice when someone is trying to talk to you
These sound great, don't be fooled by the higher priced skull candy
if you have an adjustable equalizer on your music player these get great lows and natural sound when you e_q to your taste
if you have an Apple product don't bother, everything I've ever heard on an Apple music player sounds flat and colorlessI prefer a more live sound then compressed studio mixes
It does not have the volume control
Build quality seems to have degraded, I have gone through 2 pair in less than 4 months
Honestly I think these are a lot better than the urbeats which cost $100 and I got these for about $20, i had these headphones for over 6 months now and I still pick them over my urbeats
These stay in your ears and provide really good sound and it's very high quality
The only sad part is you can't turn up or turn down the volume, you only can pause, skip, or reverse
But really, if your looking for really good earphones that aren't too pricey Id say buy this one, the low star reviews could be over exaggerated but maybe there was something wrong with their set of earphones but over all Id bring these everywhere I go
The pair received were knockoffs
The packaging was different with the fonts on the package incorrect with a dot over the y that shouldn't be there, no L or R on the bud, and the mic on wrong side
Excellent buy
These headphones are great
The button on it doesn't really do anything but pause music play back but the sound quality is good
great
Good deal
Well, they did replace mine when it broke after using it for 3 months
I enjoyed using it very much and one day, even with proper use and careful handling, the earbud piece got separated from the hard plastic housing, and that was that
They did honor their warranty, though, so yay
I'll probably be buying something else the next time, though
The earbuds broke
I had to superglue the two parts of the hard plastic bud together
These did not stand up to the same abuse as another pair of Skullcandy earbuds I had
They broke after a week
I have been using Skull Candy for years and they have always lasted forever and sounded amazing
These lasted 2 months and then just fell apart
Honestly I think they're knock offs, the symbol on the ear bud isn't quite right and they are really low quality
I love skull candy and would recommend them to anyone but these are not the real deal
I use them as both headphones and cell phone conversations
They work as designed but are not very durable
I plan to use them until they fall the rest of the way apart
My next pair will not be skull candy
Just received my headphones and only 1 of the ear buds actually works
Skullcandy Ink'd has been my earbud of choice for many years and these are just as good as my last pair
The sound is amazing, far better than any other bud I have tried
And the price is awesome
I think for the price and the expectation I had for these, they are wonderful
I just wanted a nice alternative to my current over the ear Skullcandy headphones
These have a very rich tone and seem to keep true to the musics intended the
I'd definitely recommend these for this price
Now hopefully they last awhile
thank you
I brought this a year ago
Have been using it heavily
Great sound clarity, volume and durability
I love it
Would recommend this product
ok, they broke on me when i removed them from one ear
these are very good ear buds
this are quality eaebuds and least every one should try this
Good
My first I am leaving the review on Amazon because this product was so horrible if I could give it a zero I would
Their quality is definitely decreasing, I bought these headphones in order to have a backup pair in case something happened to the ones I was using
Usually they last me around six months, and I will admit that I am the most cautious person with my headphones
However, when I open these the microphone did not work and neither did the play button
I am extremely disappointed
I have a friend that also had this experience
I will not be buying any of their products again
Awesome product for a great price
use it mostly to talk on phone, haven't had any issues so far
Thanks
works ok
spent extra money for better sound they are just as good as cheep ones
The ear buds separated from the cap continually, even with careful handling
Recommending superglue to fix it before use as mine broke second day
They broke less than a month after I purchased them
There was no mic
good one
no back drops
I've strayed from the Skullcandy earbuds many times and always quickly come back
They sound great, feel great and they don't fall out
The mic on this model is the only one I've found that consistently works well with my cell
Great
first pair was defective so they sent a new pair
was satisfied after they said that
Good
They broke already :( not really happy with this product
The things are great for what they are
only problem is one of my ear buds hasn't ever worked
if it worked i definitely would give 5 stars
Very good headset for the price it is going for
Audio quality is very good as well
Saw in ear headphones 2 to 3 times as expensive as these ones and also compared reviews and features and etc on all rhe different ones
My conclusion is why spend all the extra money on a overpriced in ear headset that has the same features at half the price
Give these headsets a try
LOVE IT
I would buy another
It came early and in good condition
Purchased these at the very end of July and they stopped working yesterday
Sound no longer comes in unless I hold down the microphone button, and even then it's spotty
Also, there is no way to raise/lower the volume with these headphones, and I frequently have had issues with conversations when using the microphone
Waste of money
can't adjust volume
button use is for pause/play music or answering call
It works fantastically swell
True quality
About 3 years ago I picked up a $5 pair of earbuds from the discount bin at a local bookstore
These lasted me until 6 months ago when I lost them
So I picked up a pair of these
2 months ago one earbud went out
I endured
Tonight, the second one did
When I looked up the warranty, they want the original receipt, something I do not keep
Why the second star
Well, they did work at least for a while
I will go back to that bookstore for another $5 pair that will hopefully last me 3 years again
they are great
When received this item it was already falling apart
Not sure what happened but it was already opened and missing an ear piece
This are bulls***
Don't buy them
Shorted out three days after I g I t them
Good
They sound great just hard to keep in the ear
I love skullcandy headphone
I love the way it sounds
when it comes to headphone, the #1 thing I look for is the bass and skullcandy deliver that on those headphone
what headphones are not original, so check it for perù skullcandy store, I want an explanation, they are of very poor quality
Have bought a few skullcandy sets because I am in love with the sound, bought these and another set on Aug 5th, i look after them like anyone valuing great sound would, but in all my efforts i have failed
Just above the headphone connector seems to have an issue, the sound is broken and distorted until you move the cable in that area, on both pair, manufacturer defect
has to be
I cannot recommend these to anyone on the time frame they lasted me, but gave 2 stars for the sound quality they gave while they lasted
i guess you get what you pay for, i so wish they were better
I'm a crazy skull candy fanatic
For me personally it's probably the best deal out their they might be a little bit more expensive than others but skull candy has the best sound in my opinion
I've probably washed my skull Candy's about 12 times already and their still sound brand new out the box when I got them
Their not over priced their worth every penny you spend on them I can tell you that for sure
This earphones are by far the best you can get
And for a heck of a deal
I would recommend them to Anyone
Bass is deep and the sound is clean and Chrisp and they come with a built in pause/play/skip button on the earphones
AMAZING
I used to love these
I'd have them break (one ear go dead) every 8 months or so, which was acceptable to me because the sound is good and the clicker is wonderful
In the past 2 months I've gone through 2 pairs (both ears died)
I'm not sure if I just got unlucky or if their build quality tanked, but I can no longer recommend these
as advertised
Amazing sound quality
I had skullcandy headphones before but these were just terrible
They only lasted two weeks before one of the earbuds broke and the 3
5mm port broke
Do not buys these, they break really easily
These headphones have good sound and don't cost a lot of money
I like them a lot and will buy more if I loose these
Despite my sister reminded me not to buy it as hers broke within few months
I am a caretaker so I took the risk and bought it
Guess what, it broke within 3 months, 1 bud stopped having any sound
I gave 2 stars because of the cheap price but I guess that explains why
the headphones stopped working within 2 months
Amazing sound good price quick shipping just amazing worth your money and time AMAZING
good sound but does not last long
Very good
Work and sound amazing
Bought a month ago and the right ear bud lost sound already
I'm shocked considering this isn't a nock-off
Great
These are great headphones over all
They just look a little cheap to me, nice bass design
The microphone worked great for me no problems at all with it using it on my iPod 5
The one thing is they broke very quickly
One of the sides wasn't in correctly and it got loose
Now there are unusable
I'm really disappointed on how fast these broke
I've only had them for 3 weeks
I would recommend but they do break quite fast
I enjoy Skullcandys products but half of there products break quickly
Awesome earphones and awesome buy
great product fantastic service
Skull candy earphone headphone for under $30
Yes indeed
You can't beat this deal this for this excellent product
I love skullcandy because of their low prices and high quality items
These headphones are no exception
They provide a strong, good quality sound and also have a built in microphone for phone calls
Highly recommend
Hated these for this reason
they cancel noise so much
that its terrible talking to someone when you can barely hear yourself talk
For example
plug both of your ears
then try talking normal
Thats what its like
Nice headphones
Works great when I run
Have had product for a couple of weeks and so far, so good
Very good sound quality both ways, mic works well, and buds are comfortable
For the price, a very good value
They broke the 2nd day
Purchased this for my boyfriend after the one he originally purchased stop working, and other than coming a day later than it was suppose to, this has been an AWESOME product
He says the ear pieces are so comfortable and fits perfectly in the ear
I normally love skull candy earbuds and hadn't understood the hate they got until i got this pair
Immediately started failing once i opened the box, now they don't work at all
good product
Great product, I've never been disappointed by Skullcandy for an inexpensive option for my earbud needs
I can sing the praises of having the pause/next/previous button on here, but no one cares
Just rest assured that is wildly convenient
As per quality, they're just fantastic for the price
I am not an audio expert by any means, but the noise reduction and quality of sound is great to my (untrained) ears, so I would recommend these
Fantastic ear buds for this price
You can't hear anything but te music once you put em on
Flat cable so no tangling
All in all these are excellent
Good Quality - Great Product for the $$$$No complaints
Work and sound amazing
Exactly as advertised
Great product
I like the fit and they make great headphones
Everyone I talk to says they can barely hear me
I don't think that the mic quality is what I expected from Skullcandy
I was a big supporter of Skullcandy, and I would buy their earbuds without question, but finally after having the same problem over and over again with their earbuds, I have to stop
I am a heavy earbud user, and I seem to run in to the same issue with Skullcandy, at some point the wires connecting to the port loosen up and you can no longer hear out of one of the earbuds
I have bought this specific style of earbud and the happened every time
boring color (i like fun ones), but just as high quality as any of the skullcandy 2
0's, and for only $10
love these headphones
Work great
Better sound and fit then apples headphones
My 15th pair I've had to purchase because I have a problem of misplacing them
Awesome, because they are skull candy and they really block out the sound nobody but me can listen to my songs
I've been purchasing headphones between the $5 and $10 dollar range that sound pretty good
My last set was picked up at a dollar store because life presented me a moment to get headphones before I went to the gym, so I took it
Those headphones were horrible, these are equally as horrible haha
I DJ so I have a pair of high fidelity $350 headphones, so maybe I'm just jaded to what good sounds like, but I truly believe these are terrible
The JVC Gummy's that are $7 to $8 sound phenomenal for the price
My only problem with them is that they don't have a GPS tracker so I can find them when I misplace them
;)In addition, I paid $17 for these thinking I was getting a deal
Then I came on here and saw the price
:(
More than worth it
Bass is nice quality is outstanding and they don't break easy
This is what great head phones should be
It was my fault for making assumptions but this is the first time I've seen inline controls that didn't include volume, it only clicks
The description said there were 3 sizes of gels but mine only came with two
They sound good, though
great quality
they are great
This is the second pair I purchased and both had the same issue
After the first 5-6 months for the first pair, the ear bud became separated so that the speaker portion dangles by the two wires inside
I purchased another pair 3 months ago and the same thing happened again
I have had success with Skullcandy in the past but the quality seems to be slipping now
ear earphone very sturdy and excellent cost benefit
Excellent for daily use
I used them for two days and they are already broken
It's amazing and helped me be able to hear it :)
The sound quality on these things is Horrible
Very unbalanced, heights were extremely scratchy and the lower range just never happened
Physically they feel good and strong, but to be honest I could hardly bare to listen to these for more than 5 minutes
These are better off left in the warehouse
HORRIBLE after only a week i could only hear out of one hear, dont bye this, it will break after a couple days
I've been using Skullcandies since I was a kid, and let me assure you of the quality of this brand
The sound in these earbuds are pretty good, and the quality of the product is great for the price
Furthermore, you get a lifetime warranty with the earbuds, which come in handy as the cheaper models tend to wear out in the span of a few months
All in all, this is a great product
Both earbud parts broke off the day I got them
Don't waste your money
Exactly as advertised
Great product
If I could give this item zero stars I would
I have only used these headphones twice… both times while sitting at my desk working and already one of the earbuds (the one with the mic attached to it) is faulty
90% of the time it does not transmit sound, and the other 10% of the time it is faint sound, or sound only comes through when I move the wire (although this is no guaranteed fix)
Do not waste your money on these
It's been a few months, and these still work perfectly; great for their price
I have always liked Skullcandy, so these earbuds are nice
The mic is good for when you want to talk to someone on the phone; You can use the earbuds to listen to them and the mic to speak
Well worth the price
Delivered quickly and in good condition
The phones work
Sound is loud and clear
My grandson loves them
Worked great for 4 months then the jack broke
Now the headphones are no good
I've had two pair previously
These have uneven sound and have cracks in the plastic
Just got them and they sound great but some of the copper on the inside and starting to come up already
but still sound great
Great sound quality
I recently purchased these headphones at my local Wal-Mart
My only complaint is the size of the driver
It took a bit of breaking my ear in, but its not like the old apple headphones
They fit 90%
The sound quality is great
A lot of depth in the bass
I use these every day for music and movies
The mic works very well and haven't had anyone complain of quality on a call
Don't hesitate to purchase these
They work great and I received my order quickly
Very pleased
good
Good sound quality
Pros:- Rich Sound Quality- Noise cancelling button works great with an iPod Classic- Comfortable in ears- Don't need to crank the volume to hear wellCons:- Earbuds fall out easily (Even with normal activities like cooking)- Be careful of the wire connecting to the plug (My flip case caused the wires to have problems and the music to become tinny and then stopped working after 3 months)- Mic doesn't always register on Windows 7 computerIf you want some cheap headphones that work well and have some cool features then this will work great for you
If you have a flip case I'd recommend either change your case, or find another set of headphones
I've had the case for 5 years, as long as I've had my iPod, and I've never had this problem with any other set of headphones so quickly
I'll either get another set of these, since I love the sound quality, and change my case or I'll try another type of Skullcandy earbuds
these are great mines came refurbished but at least theyre real
I don't know if this is what it's usually like from this seller, but only one ear bud worked, nothing came out of the other one
Awesome
They work great
good ear phones
nice base good sound and keeps outside sound out well
Left earbud had bad sound quality
Right is perfect but if both won't work correctly what's the point
Ended up ordering some LG bluetooth
Didn't really want to deal with shipping back
GREAT SOUND, GREAT FIT
best sounding earbuds for the money
but
they wont last long
I've gone thru 4 sets of these earbuds in 3 months and I take care of my stuff
mu advise is buy these earbuds from Wal-Mart so u can take them back when they fail and they will fail
No mic or volume control on head phone's
Main reason I got it was I need a headset with a mic
Works great
very nice
Great sound
Great quality
Great price
Ok fit
I like the no tangle chord and the button functions as promised but these things keep popping out of my little ears
Right ear bud didn't work out of the box
What happened to the compact original Inkd ear buds
I initially thought I might have gotten some kind of generic chinese earbuds but I guess the Inkd 2
0 are really just garbage
They feel cheap and poorly designed compared to the original
They lasted for a few months but I think it was mostly cuz I blast my music on full volume & do it almost 24\7
These skullcandys are good if you just want to listen for a few hours but listen to them more than 3 hours & your ears will start to hurt over the load volume it gives off

The ear bud ripped off from the cord within  2 weeks
Not comfortable in the ear
Music quality is average, and the ear cushions were uncomfortable and didn't fit at first
I either have gotten used to it, or it has adjusted to my ear
Good for the price though, but don't expect high and amazing quality
Boom Boom,nice crisp sound
If I could give this item zero stars I would
I have only used these headphones twice… both times while sitting at my desk working and already one of the earbuds (the one with the mic attached to it) is faulty
90% of the time it does not transmit sound, and the other 10% of the time it is faint sound, or sound only comes through when I move the wire (although this is no guaranteed fix)
Do not waste your money on these
They didn't work only one ear bud play and the one that did play you could barely hear it
So no I did like them
I paid almost 20 DOLLARS for something that was such a waste of time
Nice headphones
My kids used to only rely on Skull Candy brand headphones, however we find them not lasting near as long as they used to
I have bought several over the years but these only lasted 2 months
Not worth it
I made sure to read the reviews before purchasing these but since they were more good than negative i went ahead and bought one anyway
I admit they do sound really good and loud BUT like some other review here said mine died after 4 months of use, i made sure to take extra care of them no falls no water, they were always hanging around my neck when not in use or on my table
I gave them another chance and bought another pair just to be sure and sure enough the other paid did the same thing worked perfectly for 3 months and just died so at this point i'm done with skullcandy
Does exactly what it's supposed to
The quality of sound is great
I only use these at work while I'm sitting at my desk so I don't really put alot of stress on them but the sound is great and they feel like pretty good quality
I had to switch the silicon covers that came on them to the smaller ones (also included) but maybe my ears are tiny
Eithert way, good product for the price
Broke after 1 month
Terrible construction
I bought these a few months ago and love them
They're indestructible
I accidentally left them in my gym shorts and threw them in the washer and dryer
They came out and still work great
Got the headphones and one of the speakers did not work
The guy refunded my money
Good headphones, bang for my bucks
I have several pairs of Skullcandy headphones, and these are my favorite
They fit comfortably in my ear and they sound great
Very nice for the price
Didn't buy these from Amazon, but got them at Best Buy
Lasted barely 2 weeks before the left side stopped working
They're garbage
1
earphone comes apart,  i have to tape it
2
People cannot understand me if I am moving at all
Headphones are working well so far
I have a few complaints as far as their ability to remain in my ear goes, but I think that might be because of the shape of my ears
The best earbuds I have ever had in my life
These eaphones are really good but dont last that long
Especially if your a skater like me who moves alot while listening to music
Great bass and sound
Would have given it a 5 star if they were a bit more robust
They just don't last long enough with 12, 13, and 14 year olds fighting over them
Extremely bad product
Nice for an inexpensive set of ear buds with microphone
I did use the ear cups off my old Sony ear buds, so deducting one star
Would buy again
Skullcandy makes a great product
Beats Dre any day of the week
Sound is satisfactory for inexpensive earbuds
One of the buds fell apart within a month of buying, which is apparently a common issue
Avoid

Good quality while they lasted (2 weeks)
This item suck it stop working on one side
I've bought two of these make of headphones in the past and this is the last time I'll ever buy from Skull Candy
Firstly, they're poorly made
The first pair broke within a month of use
The headphone jack came clean off of the cord without any warning or observable reason
So I bought another pair, hoping that maybe I just purchased a faulty one
This one I've had for about 3 months and ALREADY one of the earbuds refuses to produce noise and the other constantly pops
And secondly, these earbuds are HIGHLY overrated
You could buy something much better at an equal price
This will be the last time I buy a pair of Skull Candy earbuds
A true disappointment
Pros: Cheap, durable, lifetime warrantyCons: very muffled sound
I had an ink'd 1
0 and thought that these second generation headphones would be the same or better
Turns out I was wrong
The sound is very muffled that things don't sound good at all
Was hoping for more Skullcandy
I love these headphones
I have multiple pair and I can honestly say these are the only actual earbuds that do not bother my ears
I also noticed the sound does not blast from them on a low volume like my other headphones did
It comes with adjustable ear padding too for smaller ears
I will buy these again and I have already gotten other pairs for my family and friends
It has a good price considering its excellent sound, sounds powerful and best of all it is very comfortable on the ears
----------------Tiene un buen excelente sonido considerando su precio, suena potente y lo mejor de todo es que es muy cómodo en las orejas
Great
I have it for more than 2 years and it works great
When I got them, I would have rated them at 5 stars
They fit great, had a stellar microphone for skyping and phone calls, and the color/design was cool as well (my coworkers liked them a lot) for the price I paid (about 15 at the time)
The biggest problem was that they broke probably about a month or so after they arrived
Working absolutely great for the first 2 weeks I had them, I had them attached to my iPod or my Droid in my pocket
The bass was amazing and so was the sound quality (for a 10-20$ pair of headphones)
The upsetting part of this situation was that they didn't last
Just above the input (the gold/silver part) the rubber on the chord came apart exposing the wires
I started losing reception in the left earbud, followed by the right about a day or two later
I plan on filing warranty with my headphones
This has happened twice, but I just figured the first time was my fault so I didn't complain about it
I may never buy another pair of these again (I've owned 2 pairs), despite how amazing they were when I got them
Hoping for better experiences with Skull Candy (who know how to create great sound quality, but seemingly poor craftsmanship) in the future
- Overall, great headphones if you aren't using them to go jog, or do work outside
Just my experience
Hopefully others didn't have the same issues
We'll see where the warranty goes
My husband buys, on average, about 6 sets of earbuds a year
Mostly because he leaves them in his gym shorts and they go through the wash
But, that's beside the point
I'm leaving this review because he has tried many, many earbuds and has paid 4X as much as these cost
Yet, these are the earbuds he has finally settled on as the best performing and most comfortable
And they are very reasonably priced
I received this item with good condition
The Skullcandy S2IKDY-003 are perfect
The sound quality is great
They fit snug in your ear, work just like a pair a Skullcandys would
They messed up
They only worked for a couple of days
Total thumbs down 
Good earphones for the price
The base is good
It doesn't amplify sound to an annoying levels like the Skullcandy Titans which I was afraid of
The quality of the wire is also good
They don't pop out of the ears like some of my earlier earphones
The only drawback is that if you are sitting in silent places like office or library and have been listening to songs with these earphones on, chances are that the person sitting next to you can hear the songs as well
This happens even if you are not at full volume
Other than that, these are good for the price range
Another good earphones for around $10 are Sony MDREX10LP/BLK In-Ear Headphones
Sturdy and durable for a guy who destroys ear buds
I really liked the sound specially the bass performance but it lasted only 9 days, the left side lasted 7 days and the second two days later went silent also
Skullcandy makes an exceptional great product
I loved those headphones I care here my music very good they are very comfortable in my ear
I am not happy with this order first of all its defective this is supposed to have bass on both sides right
Well you'd be wrong plus they are really easy to break even if you're careful
3/10
It was disappointing not being able to adjust volume from the headphones, and I'm actually not sure the mic works very well, I've been avoiding using it because my girlfriend couldn't hear me when I tried using it the first time
Pros: Excellent sound quality, nice tangle free cord, seems to be well constructed
Snug fit for my small ears
Cons: None yet, though other reviewers complained about durability
Will have to watch out for that
I lost a more expensive pair of Yamaha earbuds that I was no longer happy with
Anyways, Best Buy had these on sale for like $12 bucks, so I figured why not give em a try
Honestly, I was a bit skeptical because most of these "hot brands" produce pretty meh quality products
So far, these headphones have great sound quality, especially for costing less than $20 bucks
Much better then my Yamaha earbuds
High are crisp, while the mids and bass are well represented
So long as these ear buds prove to be sturdy and last more than a few months, I will be very happy with this purchase
These are the worst earbuds I've ever used
The initial sound quality was decent for the price, but that's the only positive thing I can say about them
The earbud are uncomfortable and fit very poorly
After 2 weeks, the sound would occasionally cut out
After 4 weeks, the left earbud stopped working completely
At 6 weeks, the mic and button stopped working, and after 2 months the right side failed as well
I imagine that the reason they broke so quickly was due not only to the use of cheap materials, and the poor production quality, but that the design of the product itself is foolish and faulty
The texture of the material used for the cords feels similar to that of a rubber band, so they tend to stick to almost every surface they touch, resulting in a constant tugging on the earbuds
The part of the cord that splits at the Y is covered by a bulky mass of the same material and made to look like their logo
That massive chunk of material in line with the thin wires ensures that it will catch on absolutely everything it touches and the earbuds will be violently yanked out of your ears countless times
As you might imagine, this can be quite painful and could possibly result in a ruptured ear drum
Aside from being extremely irritating, these issues put addition strain on the wires at the connections and cause them to break
I wouldn't recommend these to anyone I liked
I purchased these Skullcandy earbuds after hearing a lot of positive comments about the company's products
I am deeply dissatisfied with my purchase, however:1) The earbuds to not fit well
This is likely a product of the "one size fits all" plan
One size has never fit all
The earbuds constantly move around inside my ear and require readjustment once a minute or so
They also feel remarkably bulky despite the fact that they are supposed to be small
2) The click control is a joke
Yes, you can play and pause
But that's all you will be able to do
Trying to double click to skip a song or triple click to go back a song is nearly impossible
I don't even think a professional gamer has the manual dexterity to click fast enough for the earbuds to register it properly
3) I get strange feedback whenever I plug them into my computer
The feedback does not render the earbuds unusable, but you definitely don't want it when you are trying to enjoy some music or a movie
4) The sound quality is okay, but I have purchased cheaper earbuds with comparable or better quality
Can't wait for this pair to break now
Delivered on time
Product was mint condition in original packaging
Worked amazing usually very expensive headphones but I got a great deal would definitely deal with this company again
Thank you
They don't even work
GREAT BUY
I'll never buy another pair
Bought 2nd pair, lasted only two months
I love these things
I used them on my motorcycle under the helmet and they fit really well
Good stuff
I will buy something else later on
thank you
Great head phones
Usually when I  buy headphones, I break them a few months later on accident (rolling them over with my chair, laundry, ect)
With these I put extra effort into taking care of them, as I needed them for work and play and have always liked Skullcandy products
Unfortunately, three weeks after purchasing, one of the ear pieces stopped working
Holding the cable the right way worked for awhile (loose wire) but that doesn't work anymore, and I really shouldn't have to be repairing something I just bought three weeks ago
They are comfortable and have good sound, they just stopped working correctly after 3 weeks
It is possible that I bought a faulty set but I'm not going to be taking my chances with these again
My girlfriend said that earphones are not bad, but not great either
When she made calls with them, she said it was very hard to hear the other person; she is on the fence about these earphones
Thank you again for everything
When the headphones came in the mail I noticed that the plastic that they come in opened way too easily
I also noticed that the ear pieces had dents and gashes all over them
This seller is very untrustworthy and is false advertising this as being new when really he is selling used pairs
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER
I got these two days ago and they are already broken
The reason was that the cord came out of the mic
I had bought one without the mic before and it was very durable
So I thought that I should get one with volume control
This only has a pause button
UPDATEBtw tried to return them but they didnt believe it was broken out of the box -1star for that now ive paid the price for the I assume better quality 50/50s Somme advice do not buy from hendersons variety shop
These worked very well, however, after a month or so one ear bud had already stopped working
The mic quality was great and so was the hearing quality, but I wished they'd worked longer
fine
Speakers work very well, but wiring is not very good contributing to a shorter life, I reinforce with some heat shrink tubing to reinforce the cable
Louder than i expected
Nice quality i use it with my Galaxy s4
No problems, cord is really long, gets in the way at times, but i can't complain
I bought these earbuds less then 6 months ago, I liked them fine, but they eventually cut out in one ear
If you buy these, save your receipt to take advantage of the warranty
I am buying a different brand this time
Ok, so the highs are a bit tinny - but just a bit
The mids are slightly muddy, but only slightly
Bass is solid and clear
For a guy like me that loses headphones so much he should just buy a subscription - these are a great value
I like bass heavy music
If you do, I think you would not be disappointed at this price point
Or you can spend another $80- $180 for < 10% quality boost
These headphones have phenomenal sound quality for the price point, as you should expect from Skullcandy
The problem I had was with the build quality
Again it was good and very comfortable but, they broke after a month and a half
Now normally I only expect ear buds to last on average 3 months but, before buying these I had 50/50s which lasted 2 YEARS
I know, crazy right
I came to the conclusion that it was because I was exercising and using them at work which I move around a lot and that caused them to break very quickly
So my advice is if you are only using them around the house or at the computer, get these
Great sound for the price
If you're going to be using them during activities, shell out the extra $10 for the 50/50s
I had purchased these because my other skullcandy earbuds had been stolen and I had gotten skullcandy in the past and they have lasted me years and as soon as I got these, I tried them of course, and one side didn't work
Of course me being all about my music, I messed with them till finally I got both sides to work
But, if you don't have the time to mess around with them, don't buy them
Seriously, I've never had earbuds that broke this fast
I've actually owned two sets of these
I forgot how s***** they were the first time, and ended up buying them again :(  Never again, never forget
The sound quality is terrible, they slip out of my ears, and they are tacky as s*** with tack tacked on
I have purchased these ear buds in the past
The sound is excellent for a reasonable price
I love that I can listen to music or audiobooks on my iphone and pick up a call with little effort
My family and friends tell me the microphone sound is really good also
I would definitely purchase these again in the future
they are great working loud headphones they have great bass i would recommened these headphones over many other headphones  and they are cheap to
Pros - Price, iPod control, light weight, cord doesn't tangle or break where it comes out of the plug, plug is small enough to fit with a phone cover, comfortable, sounds great for the price range, cheap enough if they break or I lose them I won't be madCons - No volume control, no little slider on the cord to tighten it up closer to my chin, they will invariably break apart (not really a huge deal if I use them daily for 6-12 months)To the people complaining about sound quality - You're comparing $17 earbuds to $200 ones
What are you expecting
That's like me comparing my Corvette to a 84 Ford Tempo and calling it slow and ill handling
I know Skullcandy's QC and durability can be a little suspect, as I have had a few pairs go south over the years
So far these have been great
I have used them daily at the gym for 2 months and they show no signs of damage or wear
Overall earbuds are good
Money wise its bit expensive compared to other brands
Sound clarity is good
There are other options available in the site do more research before opting for this
I always knew about skull candy, but I always had the iphone versions  or some off brand, after reading the reviews I finally bought one, and i can say i love it better,  the base take a little bit to get use to but worth it
The earbuds are great to use
They are high quality, the mic is very useful for me daily
And I just gotta say it's fantastic and worth the price it is
I have bought 3 different variants of these buds, only because they were the cheapest I could find at the airport
34$ a pair
What the expletive
Every one had had one of the buds blow out in a week
And when I say blow out, I mean dismantle as you pull them out of your ears
Terrible product
Boycott
Please don't do yourself the injustice of buying these for yourself
This newest set was doing great, until I pulled them out and the metal sound piece was stuck in my ear completely detached
Horrible quality, tons of background noise
The only thing these buds have going for them is they are the cheapest in Baltimore and Philadelphia airports
Once again, BOYCOTT
Do not buy these ear buds, unless your only expecting a week out of them
Apple buds are much better, and they are terrible
That's a serious, statement please take it seriously
Sound quality is ok
The cords seem to tangle easily
Great as Always
Wonderful product
Worked for a solid three weeks until one earbud decided to stop working
Second pair of Skullcandy headphones that have broke in the past two months
If you enjoy a hassle, this is for you
It stopped working after 2 weeks
My expectations for this product was so much
Then I came to realize it was just the same as the others
Yeah, it'd probably be great if it lasted longer, the product was nice looking, but it wasn't much, since it stopped working
So good I use these as my go to set for gifting friends and family
great
Great sound
I bought these headphones at Meijer, thinking they were going to be something I would regret buying
You know, bad quality, sounds horrible, just a flat out waste of money
They were $18
99 at the time, and when I started using them, I died inside
I've used headphones and earbuds from so many different companies (Bose, Beats, iHome, etc
) and they never made me feel the way these earbuds made me feel
They were in my opinion better then Beats by Dre
The only downside is that they stop working very quickly and without warning
About 2 months after I bought the earbuds the left earphone stopped working
It didn't blow out, it wasn't a shortage in the wire
It just stopped working, but with all skullcandy headphones they come with a warranty
So keep your proof of purchase (Receipt, or Proof Of Purchase Paper) in a safe place so when they do mess up, you can take advantage of the warranty
But other than that, they are amazing
And I really do recommend them to anyone looking for some great earbuds without spending a fortune
The headphones sound good
But I may have missed all the notes on compatibility as I have an Android based phonebut none of the additional noted features work for me (play/pause, track forward etc) and the male end doesn'tmate well with my phone
I have to keep playing with it to seat it in, to achieve stereo sound
If I don't fiddle with it Iget sound in only one ear and the audio is quite faint
Otherwise the fit of the ear buds is great (it doesn't hurt my ears)and it gives a nice full sound once the ends mate well
The sound is good and the microphone functions as needed, but the ear-set with the microphone has already fallen apart as the glue clearly weakened and stripped off
I will glue it back together, but it should have already been set in strongly
My husband was going through earbuds monthly until I purchased these
He loves them
They fit in his ears, stay in and have lasted longer than others purchased
This is the third pair of Skullcandy earbuds I've bought for myself at this price point, and the sixth pair that I've bought for my family at this price point, but it will probably be my last
Although the price point for these earbuds is good, Skullcandy has now apparently decided to cut corners on quality
These earbuds don't have the little rubber things that serve as a buffer between the hard plastic part of each earbud and the cord
This means the earbuds will short out earlier because when they flex, they will always flex right where the cord meets the hard plastic entrance of the earbud
It also makes the earbuds uncomfortable because the hard plastic cord entrance is rather sharp, unlike a soft rubber gasket
Poor, cheap, corner-cutting design
Skullcandy, you can't retain customers with your brand name alone, and you've lost this loyal customer unless you learn real quick from this boneheaded mistake
First of all, these dumb things keep falling out my ears
They either fall out completely, or they kind of just hover right outside my ear so the sound is half as audible as it should be
I don't know if my ear holes are too small or what, but I'm a grown adult
I've tried cramming them in but alas they manage to slip out within seconds
And I just end up with wax on them
Ew
Second, even if I could use them properly, the sound quality is just lame
I don't know if these other reviewers are listening to the same earbuds as I'm listening, but I am not hearing any bass whatsoever
It's a very flat sound
Even my old jank on-their-last-leg earbuds still have quality sound
I have avoided this product because I have never had luck with "cute" electronics (with names like Skullcandy), but this was the only one available
Looks like this one is no different than the rest
for the price you cant find better quality or comfort
The buds stay in my ear fine even when working out/ running
the control button stopped working a week after i got it and its hard to hear out of them when using them
Got these for my son as a gift
He actually pointed these out as Best Buy
I went home and checked Amazon
Naturally they were a lot less
Great product, no complaints
Barely audible bass response
Tinny highs
I got these as a backup for my VMODAs
No comparison at all
Good to have them in an emergency, but I won't use them for everyday
I loved how they paused an unpaired whatever I was watching or listening to these skullcandy headphones are truly amazing
Louder than i expected
Nice quality i use it with my Galaxy s4
No problems, cord is really long, gets in the way at times, but i can't complain
I bought these earbuds less then 6 months ago, I liked them fine, but they eventually cut out in one ear
If you buy these, save your receipt to take advantage of the warranty
I am buying a different brand this time
After about a month the right earbud is dead, I only use them in my office computer so they do not get beat around my pocket or anything like that
They sound ok, but the durability is in the gutter
Great sound but doesn't matter if only one earbud works
I wasn't wasn't even hard on them
Literally just sat them on my desk so I could listen to music at night
I wouldn't recommend these
Had these same headphones but had to buy a replacement
Don't get me wrong the headphones did not break
It was my fault
I always seem to lose everything
These headphones are amazing
My previous set had been washed 3 times due to me leaving them  in pockets of clothing and forgetting about them but surprisingly they still worked like the day I took them out of the packaging
The current set has lasted me since mid February
Several reasons I decided to purchase them again the mic/control which can pause/play music among other things
They also have flat wiring instead of the round you get on other headphones which provides for easy untangling because i just stuff them into my pocket
At most retail stores you can get them for about $20 but luckily i found them here on Amazon for $10
50 free shipping from bargain accessories
Not sure if you can get them for that price any more but you still only have to pay $14-$16 instead of $20
These earbuds have the sound quality I would expect at this price range
However, the mic muffles every sound and makes it very difficult to understand what is being said
If you don't plan on utilizing the microphone often, or for important conversations, this is a cost-effective product
These headphones are very nice, but the ear buds come off way too easily
I have ad to replace lost ones three or four time already
I've use many headphones in my time & used SkullCandy's for the last 5yr or so & highly enjoy them but these "Ink'd Headphones w/ Mic" aren't up to my standards
Mainly due to the fact that for some reason the RIGHT earbud gives more bass than the LEFT (which is the side the Mic is ON) as well as the Highs being a little too high for me
I'm more into bass and boom since I listen to a lot of Rock/Metal, watch movies/TV shows on Netflix along with viewing gaming videos on YouTube all with my WindowsPhone8 while heading to work on the bus
Now I've done many tests to prove this & I'm not wrong
A friend gave me the Ink'd "Rasta" Earbuds w/Mic before purchased this pair brand new a few days later
Used them both on multiple devices & even switched sides of earbuds (Used left bud on right ear ect
) & got the same results every time
Don't get me wrong, they WORK as stated but I'm not 100% satisfied with them & that's just me
Hope my Review helps your decision
Thank You
Initially they worked great
After about a week of minimal use, one of the earphones stopped working
Very disappointed with Skullcandy as this is one of several times this has happened
My previous ones were sent directly to skullcandy since they have a lifetime guarantee and I never received anything back,
For 12 bucks you can't beat the quality of skullcandy's
They never get uncomfortable and they come with some extra sizes if you feel like the default buds are too big or small
The mic works really well
This is my second pair, (I am pretty rough on them
first lasted me over a year) I will continue to buy
Good stuff
I will buy something else later on
thank you
Good quality
Utter piece of crap
I bought it because my Dell laptop always showed it as one of the options for a headphone whenever I plugged anything in
Damn it
The wire is weak and cracked one day (2 weeks after I bought it
End of story
These headphones have lasted longer than any pair of headphones I've had before
I was unsure about them as they're the kind that fits inside your ear but I got used to them after awhile
Faulty production: as soon as I received it in the mail I tried it, and notice a significant sound difference in the left ear bud
Now I have to waste my time trying to get a refund
terrible product
What a rip off
These are the worst buds I've ever had, I received a crappy buds, they sound terrible, they look on very low quality, I will never buy them again, please don't buy them or you'll regret
Even better than my old ink'd earbuds
They're practically noise cancelling with the right size silicone tips, and the sound quality is great
Compared to my other 20$ earbuds, these are crisp and clear
I am surprised that the bass is not overwhelming as was in other skullcandies I've had
I have another similar set with flat cables that I got for 20$ and the sound is so muddy and pretty mono
These have a very dynamic "surround" feel to them, and again everything is clear and sounds right
I'm also pretty pleased with the materials, they don't feel like cheap plastic
everything feels rubberized
The flat cable is not very wide, so there's still tangles but pretty minor, take a few seconds to get out (vs minutes, or never, on round cables) They feel a little delicate so I wouldn't tug on them if they're caught some where
These headphones were delivered June 2
I thought the sound quality especially the base was great for inexpensive headphones
Today July 9, I went for a run, and the earbud separated into two parts
The window for returns was over July 2
Glue may work
For the price I figured  I would be satisfied with six months
But a few days over a month is unacceptable
They might be used but there perfect i couldnt ask for better they have nice sound & nice texture thanks
I've owned a couple of pairs of these
The sound is very good for a small earbud--better than the Apple earbuds--and the mic works fine (I use it for work calls regularly, and everyone can hear me just fine)
These also fit my ears better than any other earbuds I've used (the two sizes of rubber covers are key)
I like the flat cord as well--I find it tangles much less than a regular cord, and untangles more easily
However, don't expect these to last very long
Both sets I've had have failed--i
e
, one of the stereo channels suddenly goes dead, making it pretty much useless for music--within a few months
Fortunately they're not too expensive, so if you just think of them as disposable and are OK with buying a few pairs a year, you'll be OK
Used with my Samsung smart phone
Superior sound quality to the ear buds that came with it
I like the limited lifetime warranty too
These get a second star only because while they work, they have good sound
I have owned five pairs of Skullcandy earbuds in the last year
They fail on average after about 60 days
Somehow, though, they seem to have cornered the market for relatively inexpensive headsets with mics--so it's buy and replace (and replace and replace) or nothing
Cons: The microphone plastic cover came off the second I took the headphones out of the packaging
The sound quality of mediocre with almost no base
Pros: Shipping was fast
Edit: I got a full refund thanks to their customer service
The product may be bad but their service is great
Why do we buy new headphones
Usually we are replacing lost or broken headphones
In this case I bought these to replace my iphone 5 standard headphones
I bought skull candy because i knew the sound quality was decent, and it had a microphone for practicality
However, these broke very quickly
And I was only able to use them for a week or twoReally bad quality headphones, and it's clear skullcandy's business plan is to upcharge shotty headphones
Sound was good till the mic and headphones broke in under a month
The wire next to the audio jack must have come loose because as it moves it causes my audio to skip and the volume to change
At this point the mic only works in certain positions
Really disappointed with these headphones
The audio was good till they broke in 2 weeks
Decent headphones, but the plug material accumulates dust like no other
It also stopped working after 3 months of use, which is quite disappointing
The didn't send me the right product
In the photo, the headphones have a mic connected to it
But I received headphones without a mic
2nd pair i bought only because i gave the first pair away
accidentally left them in my pocket, they got washed, then dried, and they still worked flawlessly
skullcandy for ever
I guess because I was rough on the wired headphones is the reason they broke
so I purchased wireless instead
I did quite a bit of research and these head phones kept coming up as one of the better bangs for the buck
After using them for about 6 months I have to agree that they offer great sound quality, the cord is rather flexible and the Mic actually works with my Android
The One Problem:They are a metal housing
That means every time I roll in my office chair I get zapped(Static Shock) in the ear
It's a little annoying, since I'm stuck at a desk all day
I put a wrap of electrical tape around them and they work great
Other than that I am very happy with these head phones
These head phones are light weight and have great sound for the price
Once you use these, you won't use anything else
Just got these today
They offer good bass, mid and fairly clear highs
Yet to check durability of these earphones
People can't hear me on the other end of the mic
It is kind of nice that I can play/pause music, but prob will just stick to getting the mic less ones from now on
Ive been using these headphones every day for 3 months
They work great, good sound quality, and the mic has worked great for skyping as well
I have only one beef, but its really annoying
The material used to cover the wires is of a rubbery texture, not plastic like on most headphones
This makes it more durable, I think, however also grippy rather than slick
So the cable drags on clothes, or gets caught in a fold or something, and yanks earbuds out of ear
At least that's my experience
Really annoying
These ear bud were only used a few times before one side stopped working
Thought all would be well until I tried to get the warranty covered
I don't have a printer and you must print out this long form and go to a UPS or fedex place to send them back
Guess we are out $17
I bought these in order to use them on my motorcycle
I rode them on the highway for a 40 mile ride and the remote became unresponsive within the first 20 minutes due to being exposed to the wind
Also due to the vibrations or wind audio would cut out
Terrible Headphones
Very disappointed and will return them
Great headphones
They fit  great in the ears, have good sound, and are lightweight
Like the on and off switch too
I liked the non tangle cordige but the gentle care one ear bud stopped working within a week
In a word "junk"
Purchased these headphones to be used strictly for my mobile phone
Noise reduction works great and the clarity is excellent
For the price, these are a great
I've bought several other cheaper brands in the past and will no longer buy anything but the skullycandy brand as long as the price remains competitive
I guess because I was rough on the wired headphones is the reason they broke
so I purchased wireless instead
My other skullcandy earphones finally broke after 3 years of use
Those didn't have the microphone in line so I wanted one that did
I got these for a good price on Amazon and the buds fit comfortably and the sound is good
(I'm not an audiophile but I appreciate good speakers and headphones)
It is not bose noise-cancelling headphone quality sound, you will get some background noise leakage but it is good enough for my purposes (at the gym or running outdoors), plus now I can take calls without holding the phone to my ears
I'm not a fan of bluetooth earsets - you don't have to recharge these and they double as headphones
It okay I haven't broke it yet surprising but there loud and I like really loud headphones
I love bacon
one earbud stopped working after two weeks
I was just listening then the next morning, one earbud didn't work
I was mad
I have another pair(the exact model) that louder
But overall this model, for the price is my favorite set of everyday ear buds
Great for the gym, work, drowning out the kids(& you can take a call if you get one)
Made a lot of calls with these, they work great(don't have top worry about blue tooth interference from things like servers)
The sound that comes out sounds really muddy and has a very low audio quality
It only favors lows and bass
I guess if you buy Skullcandy headphones, that is all you want
Vocals sound awful, and acoustic music is pretty bad
Also, the mid and control device on the cord of my pair broke within a month of buying them
I have no idea why
There were no cracks or any sign of damage
It must be a techincal problem
I always get techincal problems when buying Skullcandies, whether sound only comes out of one bud, or it has static after a few weeks
Don't buy these headphones
There really good work great have no proble with sound or mic just what I new they would work like
These work great with my Windows phone and are excellent for phone conversations
I haven't used them for listening to music so I can't comment on them in that regards
I have tried other ear buds in the past from other companies and i like these the best
I have had them for over a year and they are still kicking
I use them for everything from my iPod for music, to my PC to watch movies
They are also easy to clean by removing the rubber part and just as simple to put back together
I'm a long time Skullcandy fan and this particular pair had the left earbud just stop working on me for no reason
Forums said this is a typical problem
The "warranty" however only refunds you whatever you paid on Amazon and then you have to buy the "replacement" from the Skullcandy website, where it is a few $ more, plus shipping both ways
So "replacing" this defective product if you land a bad pair will run you another $4-8
eventually stop working- barely hear anything, the microphone eventually stopped working
I am extremely dissatisfied with this product
don't buy this
I bought these almost exactly a year ago and I love these headphones
Great sound, and the mic is good
However, I have to wiggle the cord to get the left side to work
They seem like good quality but after reading other reviews of how one side quits working, it may not be worth purchasing
Bought these for my boyfriend, and they are just fantastic
I do not buy any other headphones other than these
The flat wires are fantastic
The quality of the sound fits the price I paid for them, and the wire is long enough for him to place the phone in his pocket without tugging
Overall, I am very happy with this product and would most definitely re-order
These are inexpensive, and a better quality than most you find in cheaper stores
You do get what you pay for
For the $15 pricing i pretty much thought it was worth the money
Ive bought a couple of these but they eventually die out(abuse) accidental strong tugs/pulls when cables gets caught on something (often) OVERALLThis is well worth the $$ and are pretty durable even if you blast your music, bass is VERY nice and remember guys its cheap headphones not your (highend) beats/bose headphones but hell they sure sound like it
The sound was good but not a lot more from cheaper product
After 1 month it was not working anymore
used them for 2 days (use them to study at school) and then someone STOLE them
:( but over all they are really nice and like how it has a mic too
ive had 4 pairs of these (usually because i lose them or the rubber piece gets lost
every single pair ive had is amazing, and always works great, the sound quality and the bass is really good, i 100% recommend these to anyone who needs slim good sound headphones, with a mic, the mic works very well for calls
I bought a pair of these that lasted me two years
I'm assuming they made improvements to them because the sound is WAY better, especially the bass, and the cord is longer
Hopefully these can also last me two years
I bought these to replace a set that I'd gotten at my local gas station
My old ones had a hollow, muffled sound that didn't translate music or speech well
These work much better
I've heard better, but they are still a vast improvement over the ones I got at the "gas station"
I did quite a bit of research and these head phones kept coming up as one of the better bangs for the buck
After using them for about 6 months I have to agree that they offer great sound quality, the cord is rather flexible and the Mic actually works with my Android

Other than that I am very happy with these head phones
The headphones offered great quality sound and an OK microphone
Additionally, the in ear fit is very nice
I think there are quality problems thoughThese headphones broke after about a year of use
This is the second pair of Skullcandy headphones (others a different model) that broke after less than a year of use
I am not sure if this is the nature of sub $20 headphones but it feels like they should at least last a year
I like it
There is slightly more bass but being a person who likes slightly more bass, it is ok for me
These headphones didn't last for s***
In less than a week they started cutting in and out and then broke in 2
I treated then with care and hardly used then but the wires got disconnected near the base
Do not buy these they are crap
I have a very small ear and this type of earbuds usually make me feel uncomfortable, but not these ones
I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to spend a small amount of money on this type of headphones
The noise cancelling DOES work
After my original skullcandy ink'd earbuds broke after 2 years of heavy use (left earbud went out), I quickly went hunting for another pair and noticed skullcandy had these ink'd 2 ones out
They looked a bit different from the originals and that's when I got a little weary
My gut feelings were correct
Pros: Flat cable really prevents tangling, the mic works well for my iphone 4, the pause/play/skip track functions work wellCons: SOUND
I've been reading these reviews and keep seeing people mention what great bass these things have
Am I missing something here
I've burned these headphones in with a shuffle playlist on my phone for one night (like I did with my last inkd pair) and went about using them normally
After 2 weeks of use, l still have no ear-filling bass like the originals had
I tried adjusting the EQ, tried different sources (PC, other people's phones/mp3 players, etc) and it was just pitiful
Also, it really sounds like there's a sound imbalance in the right earbud, it's like it's somewhat quieter than the left side
While it's subtle, it shouldn't even be there because most people would prefer even sound distribution
Con 2 is a little more nitpicky, but there's no slide-thing that adjusts how close the headphones can be gathered together when you wrap them up around your phone/put it into your pocket
They just kinda dangle everywhere and
well, again it's just a little gripe
Overall, these new models are vastly different from the old, sound-wise
Unbalanced sound-distribution, static in some songs from overload of bass (even on low volume), and terrible bass overall even after 2 weeks of use
Glad I was able to find more of the old model for sale
skull candies are great headphones and i like that they give you different earbuds too perfectly fit my ears and the no tangle cord is great
First, I love Skullcandy Ink'd headphones in general and have bought these before BUT this set was different - cheaply made - the wire was very flimsey, the mic did not work
Sound was ok but I wanted to use for talking on my iphone
Very dissappointed - unfortunately did not discover this until after I had thrown the packaging away so unable to return
The headphones will randomly send commands to the phone
Example: Pauses and Starts Music on its own
Google Now will randomly alert me to start talking on my android
However, I will say that the audio matches that of Monster headphones
Amazing sound
I got this 2 days before estimated delivery date
When I got it, i tried it on, and I loved it
The bass is amazing
And when you put it on, you can't hear anything from the outside
:D these are worth the price for me
I found these ear bud's very comfortable, even if they did have Skulls on them
I felt these were of good quality
Well I used these for workin out and they are horrible
The stupid mic would turn on everytime I lifted my arms
Also it would pause my music all time
Would not buy ever again
As a man who was deaf since birth, I can imagine sound is very nice
And these headphones would help you hear sound  with great detail
But seeing as I have never heard sound I will assumue they are not the best
Hence the 4 star
Sounded like I got a new playlist
I could hear so much more in my music, definitely a great set of earbuds
I had no idea what I was missing with my other ones
I ordered the skull candy inked 2
0 eadbud headphones
The headphone I receiver were not the 2
0 style but an older version
When they worked they were great but they developed a short quickly and for the price, I would have expected at least 6 months or a year of usage
They work fine but after about 1 week of use, you could hear a short starting to form and the mic
Buttons are a bit overly stiff
-Same issue with the two I purchased
One had to be returned and the other is still working
these little guys sounded great when they worked and the mic sounded good for calls and they where very comfortable, but after 2 months the mic and the button stopped working and then at 5 months the left ear didn't work unless the it was plugged in just right
it does have a good warranty and i should be able to get a brand new pair :-)
The product was not defective, but it would not stay in my daughters ears, even with the adjustable ear pieces
I did not like how they in my ears either
They are fairly good
The microphone is not perfect,  but I think it has worked for me for the most part
these skullcandy earbud headphones with mic really worked out great it was simple and easy and also pretty loud I actually still have them I will recommand everyone to buy this product
These earbuds are a great value
The sound and fit are good
The only reason it's not a five is that the mic could be a little clearer
it's not awful, but I get some occasional comments that I don't sound that clear when I use these earbuds
I have really small ears, so it's often a problem that earbuds don't fit
These come with different ear bud pieces so you can find the right size
The sound quality is OK, but it does the job
I've left these in my purse, pocket, etc, so they've been beaten up a bit--still working
I use these for the gym and for work
I think I've had them for about 9 months
Given the price, I think they're worth it--and they're MUCH better than the ones that come with the iPhone
The sounds quality is ok
i don't really like the grip on the heads but it fits on my small ear
it doesn't have the volume control
overall,,, it is ok
This pair of headphones has good sound quality, fits well in your ears
So far loving it
Bought another pair
these headphones are the best
these easily lasts almost 2 years
They are pretty sturdy and great because it also includes a mic
I bought these for both of my girls
One pair had to be returned because it was broken
After just 2 months we are replacing both pair due to them shorting out
I personally wouldn't waste your money on these
My daughter asked me to buy her another pair of the Skullcandy Titan which lasted for well over a year until they got stepped on
Great headphones, exceeds my expectations for the price
Has a mic included, don't use it much on calls
Great sound, good base
I hear a static sound every time I plug these in
This ruined everything about these headphones for me and my reputation for skull candy is pretty much gone
From the first day I used these, constant quiet static sounds in the background, so annoying
These headphones shorted out after one week of use without any wear or tear
I take real good care of my electronics
These are not worth the price even if they cost $5
GARBAGE
It's a really good headphone for the price but I lacks in the bass but it still good for the price
Its a nice headphone for cheap price, it works perfectly for listen music for cell phones computers and others
I bought these specifically to go running it
They worked pretty well at first, and had good sound quality but they died in the first two weeks of me owning them
I do not reccomend these to my enemies
The sound that comes out of these are amazing
It has great deep bass and the music sounds very clear and crisp all around
My only issue is that the mic seems to stop working rather quickly, I've had 3 of them and all of them have the same issue
After only 3 weeks the socket that plugs into my phone became loose and destroyed the headphones
Unless I have them positioned in a very specific manner, the sound is distorted and low
Absolutely no further reason to keep them
Great sound and mic is awesome for talking on a cell phone
I really like the flat wire design and they fit well inside my ears
They work very well, and I don't hear outside noise when I am listening to music or watching a video
I've been through lot's of low level earbuds
Not saying that they are bad but generalizing them by price
When I initially tried the INK'D they sounded great
Better than many others in it's price range
However they do have unreliable hardware
I've been through too many, some one ear failed, others they just began to sound awful
All these problems begin within 2 months of use
Same things happen to my friends as well
They do have good customer service however, so if they do break you can exchange them
But note that I've exchanged them almost 5 times just this past year
My advice is to stay away from these earphones
I bought this as a Christmas present for my son and his is more then thrilled with it
I would recommend it
i love skullcandy brand anything
i refuse to use anything else
they always last a long time and even if they don't, the return policy is killer on the website
definitely worth it
For these being ear buds they are great
They have great sound and quality
I would buy them again when I need to look at getting replacements or an extra pair
First night both earbuds and mic worked
Second night one ear bud worked
Third night one ear bud worked off and on
I broke my first headphones
Then saw this one and boughtit only lasted a 2 months then one side stopped working
I had this one for like less then half a year and didn't regularly use it until recently
I used it to talk to my wife over my iPhone, which means no more than 2 hours a day
The sound quality is good and have no problem talking on the noisy street because of the rubber cap which fits perfectly
But in the past two days it starts have some connection issues and I have to place the plug in the certain position and depth into the socket to hear the voice
Otherwise it's all about noise and disconnections and I cannot use it anymore
These headphones actually sound pretty good for the price
I have problems with the mic button sometimes connecting to Siri instead of pausing a song or changing to the next song
Other than that a good cost effective headphone
They were great and worked fine
for the first month till the mic side stopped working all together
Ridiculous
They were not abused at all
I received them broken, but when I noticed they were broken, the package was in the trash and couldn't be retrieved
Overview:I'm an audiophile
I'm a music producer, an experienced DJ, and I go to literally hundreds of concerts every year
I also make a dozen phone calls each day
That being said, I rather like these headphones
Pro's:1) Cord is square, doesn't easily tangle
2) Mic picks up voice rather well
Good for phone calls when you need your hands
3) Bass is bumpin', and the mids & highs aren't ignored
4) Fits in ear snuggly and easily
5) Decently hardy for the price
Can survive in sub-zero temperatures
6) Doesn't cause ear fatigue as quickly as other headphones
7) Cost effective
Con's:1) Can't sleep with them
Don't let these go to far into your ear
2) Doesn't play the true sound of the song
It EQ's the bass louder than the rest (can be a good thing)3) Button on cord only stops/plays for iPhone's; it doesn't activate Siri and doesn't skip songs if pressed twice
4) Static if you bump the bottom part of the cable while connected to an output
5) I worry that like all skullcandy's, one earbud will go out
So far it hasn't
Conclusion:Bass is loud, but doesn't play the true EQ of the song
Earbuds fit well, but can hurt if pushed in
Mic picks up, but buttons don't work with iPhone besides play/stop
A very cost-effective pair of earbud headphones for casual, everyday use, and those that enjoy bass in their music
I was replacing a pair of Skullcandy earbud headphones and liked their sturdy construction, particularly the flat rubber "tangle free" ribbon cable they use (and portray on the pics on the Amazon product page)
When I got my replacement pair it was branded "Scullcandy" but was completely different from my earlier pair and not as pictured on the Amazon product site
Wiring was small stiff flimsy circular type, typical of the junk free earbuds you get thrown in when you buy an MP3 player or other audible device
Difficult to untangle
Where the old headphones lasted for a couple of years, these are cheaply constructed and will doubtless fail pretty quickly
I won't send them back because I need a pair of earbud headphones, and this product does work, but my next pair won't be Skullcandy
They're good and I liked them
They sound good I love skull candy head phones because they are loud and nice
Its a nice headphone for cheap price, it works perfectly for listen music for cell phones computers and others
these skullcandy earbud headphones with mic really worked out great it was simple and easy and also pretty loud I actually still have them I will recommand everyone to buy this product
Horrible horrible and horrible, they fell apart within 3 days, I am completely disappointed, never again, the plates that keep it together fell off, one stopped working and it was just terrible
I was really hoping to get these headphones as pictured, but it's a different model from skull candy
The ones I got are okay but not as nice as the ones I thought I was gettings :/
They were good for 4 months,  after that the left ear went out,  the mic/button worked sometimes
You get what you pay for
speakers sounded good until they blew
but what should you exspect from a cheap pair of headphones
if they could improve the life span i would get another pair
The BASS kicks, the sound is pristine, but one of my headphones has started to falter and stops the sound at time
This has happened with all my earphones, so I guess I need better earphones than this one
These were great for the first month, and the sound quality is very good
But after about a month of use the sound from the mic while talking on the phone became bad, garbled and hard to understand, plus background noise cancellation must have stopped working
Bought a $5 pair that works just as well and if I have to replace them after a month any way I wont spend the extra for the name
I ordered these for a relative as a gift; I already had a pair and they said that they really liked mine so I decided to get them the same exact one
Unfortunately, I didn't receive the item as advertised, instead I received a different pair of Skullcandy earbuds (model number: S2INBI-FZ)
They really aren't that different so it's probably not going to be that big of an issue for most people but THEY ARE NOT THE ONES PICTURED or titled on this page
Nice, decent quality sound for its price
Don't expect an expensive-sounding bass, though
It's got clear sound for mic
The cable's material is superb and easy to untangle
I would get another set
i know many people doth like the shape of these type of headphones but i would say i personally do
the reason i like them is because when you place them fairly deep in your ear, you can hear an awesome bass
also, these particular skullcandys keep the outside noise out and all you can hear is the music
I received a pair of iBeats by dr
dre for my 16th birthday and managed to keep the alive until a few weeks ago
Desperate for a pair of earbuds to use while studying and going about my day, I bought these from my school's store
I was a bit skeptical at first but quickly noticed that they worked just as well if not better than my iBeats
I used a different silicon tip than either of the original ones that came with the earbuds (the ones I use are cone-shaped) but the sound quality is superb
Highly recommend these
Definitely go for the headphones without the microphone if you can spare it, because I find I don't use the mic at all (and the ones without are cheaper
)
These ear buds are about all you can ask for at the price of $15
I was telling friends about how great they sounded and how there was really no need for anything more expensive, but then I went home and popped them in after having my studio monitor / DJ headphones on for a while and I definitely noticed these buds were no match in sound quality
The highs are a little touchy and break up occasionally, and the mids are a bit muddy
The bass that comes out of these things with the larger drivers is great though, and overall I would say the sound quality is average to above-average
For listening to MP3s on my phone and to get some quiet-time with the noise isolation at work and on the subway, these are great
If you are doing audio editing or demand accurate sound from your ear buds, you'll have to look elsewhere
At $15, you can afford to lose or break these and not really sweat it and overall the sound is pretty good
I didn't really notice the shortcomings in sound quality until comparing them to professional headphones
Was going to give them 3 stars for overall quality of the buds, but bumped it up to 4 stars because you are getting a lot for $15 here
I purchases these headphones earlier for my husband, and he lost them at the gym
He liked these ones the best so reordered them again
They work great, fit in your ears while working out
Provide 3 different size ear buds for the best fit
Sound is excellent
Assembly seems to be better
Last pair I bought the earbud actually broke
So far so good
Quality is great and it arrived on time
Only minor drawback is that when you twist the ear bud plug in the audio jack a certain way, only the left ear bud works
Other than that it was a great buy
I love these earbuds
I have small ears so it is very difficult for me to find earbuds that will not put painful pressure on my ears
These earbuds deliver great sound for the price and the mic works really well with Siri and music
The ONLY reason I docked off a star is because the silicon buds come off ridiculously easy
I have lost and found one bud several times and have finally lost it permanently
It is just as expected
Very glad I bought this
It works well for me
I would recommend
You will not be disappointed
They block out BOCK ROUND noise, good micro phone and sound is clear
The long cord makes it an easy use and it's durable
So I do not like Big earmuffs to listen to my music especially if I am working out
These are perfect for me, as I do not like the apple ear phones
These put off great sound and also can use to activate siri or the microphone on the iphone or ipad
These earbuds are a great value
The sound and fit are good
The only reason it's not a five is that the mic could be a little clearer
it's not awful, but I get some occasional comments that I don't sound that clear when I use these earbuds
This is my second pair of Skullcandy earbuds
My first pair (1
0) stopped working properly after about 2 years
Intermittent problem probably from being forced into my pockets/armband
I run a couple of times a week and these have been so useful
I loved them so much I stuck with skullcandy for my second pair
I love the size of the earbuds, I have small ear canals and these fit great, though they come with different sizes
I have tried many different ear buds and Skull candy are the only buds that do not hurt my ears
My liked me, but personally they would not return to buy new ones that are really expensive for what they are and are very fragile in the connector part is that you injures while connecting and disconnecting
I like these ear buds
They were at a good price bought them for my PS Vita
My only complaint is that Skullcandy found it necessary to put their logo on the rubber part of the earbud that goes inside your ear
It is raised up on the rubber so this kinda makes my ear raw if I use them too much
Pretty dumb design
If you have sensitive ears these are not for you
Don't know what they were thinking doing that
Someone needs to check their design team and realize comfort > looks
Very disappointing purchase for multiple reasons
-The listing says these are "Ink'd 2
0" but they are basic "Ink'd"-There is a microphone, but it does not control the volume - I never would have bought if that was clear
-One ear bud is louder than the other
Great sound and noise isolation, but the inline mic and remote broke after 5 months
Luckily skullcandy has a great lifetime warranty
Didn't buy these from Amazon but have owned 2 pairs
First one sounded wonderful at first, but after 2 months I lost the sound on the left earbud, AND the microphone feature in the cord stopped working
Sent them back to Skullcandy and got a voucher for a replacement
The second one also sounded great, and after 2 months the sound got very staticky and intermittent due to the cord coming loose where it meets the jack
Keep in mind that I never abused these at all
Just normal usage
Absolutely garbage
Within 48 hours of use, they began to crackle
Now I have to physically hold the headset plug in the phone at a particular angle to make them sound correct
Terrible quality
These headphones are great quality for the price
I always buy skull candy headphones and these have to be the best ones that I've used yet
I would recommend these ear buds, especially for persons that utilize their smartphones for both digital music use, clear and concise phone conversations
The Skullcandy products always exceed my expectations, I utilize more than one set but as I said really like to use these for devices that I need to utilize not just great digital sound but also clear dependable conversations via smartphones, internet, google hangouts, and or any other way you may need to utilize a quality set of digital quality headphones with a built in microphone to use as needed with social media, phone, and smart phone use
the mic failed after about 4 months, but they do sound good
overall they are not my favorite headphones, but they are alright
Its sound is great
among the headphoners I've used i liked this ones a lot but it longed just about 1 month to stop working
I don't recommend them because they break too fast
These are hands down the best cheaper earbuds I've tried, I now own two pair of these, one for work, one for home
The audio quality is excellent, and the earbuds themselves can stay in my ears for hours, without causing pain or discomfort like some others I've tried
They fit securely, and need to be airtight to work best
I purchased these for use with my cell phone while at the gym
I wanted to be able to tune out the noise and listen to music, but still be able to catch calls if they came through
The noise-canceling is amazing, and the call quality is crystal clear
I also love that they don't get tangled up in my purse or gym bag
I have already recommended these to several people
I have had a LOT of Earbuds over the years
and after you've tried about 3-or-4 dozen Earbuds
for the most part
they sound all the same to me with very minor differences
the fit is just different for each
until I got a pair of these
They have to be experienced for those doubters out there
The Bass in my Music is DEFINATELY felt when I pop these into my ears
clean sound and great bass
I have a $350
00 Closed-Ear Headphone set from Sony
and shockingly
these puppies truly do make the difference
I use these over my Sony ones
I bought these when they were about $12
95 for 1-pair and since then
every member of the family, friends
guests/associates that have heard me raving about these were doubters until they tried them
I really got these because of what 'TopTenReviews" had posted on them in addition to a 'Lifetime Warranty'
When I buy anything at all
I buy for quality, and because I want them to last
Give'em a shot
You won't regret it
When i bought this i totally did not consider the possibility of it being in ear
The sound quality is great and the bass plays very nicely
I am in no way an audiophile but the difference in audio quality vs other earbuds is very noticable
The only downside is that even though the earbuds come with 3 different sizes, there is no gurantee that these will fit you
And from experience, if these do not fit you absolutely perfectly, it becomes highly uncomfortable and almost impossible to keep in for a prolonged period of time
I recall switching out to regular earbuds despite a drop in quality simply because the earbuds were so uncomfortable to keep in my ear
Final thought: if these fit you, the earbuds have great quality sound and a decent mic attached to it and is a great buy for only 9 dollars (at the time of purchase)
If they do not fit you
then a pretty uncomfortable buy
I guess the main problem I have is that I am used to Sony earbuds and these are just a little different than I am used to
The cord is a kind of rubbery material that does a pretty good job of not getting tangled up
But it also drags on my clothes and so sometimes the cord pulls on the earbuds
I feel like I'm adjusting the fit in my ears more than I did with the Sony buds
One other thing is the jack
It is a straight plug and not a 90 degree plug
Maybe the cord is more rugged than the Sony's and it's not a concern
I'll see how long these last
the isolation of the exterior noise is fine, but the sound clearance not so
plus, they are keep dropping out from the ears,  doesn't matter if you use the small or the big rubber
not the worst product, but not the best either
I got this headphone a few weeks back and it is working wonderfully
I listen to lot of music and it sounds awesome on any music type
I am loving it
I really hate the weak sound of most MP3s
Depending on the device and the speakers or earbuds/headphones you are using, MP3s can sound like dog crap
But these Skullcandy earbuds really boost the bass and give a fuller sound
I can actually enjoy my MP3 music now
They fit great and really are a great deal for the money
Love the earlier version but they weren't durable at all, one side would blowoutBUT these are different
Love the flat cord and the high volume
Nice bass for some Ear Buds
Thinking of getting another pair in another color
I bought these for my husband on his birthday & he is extremely hard to buy for
He says the quality of sound and product are superior
Definitely a good buy
The headphones work awesome
They are very affordable and they've worked great for two months
The microphone works awesome too
Usually with my other purchases, the mic would always give me some problems, but this one works great with my phone (Nokia)
I would definitely buy it again
Fiirst off the headphones are great
Soung quality is good and the bass is exceptional for a pair of earbuds
Since the buds squeeze into the ears so snugly they also serve as earplugs
I've used them when I try to sleep but me little niece and nephew want to play or argue
They come in real handy on long flights
But, the reason I've purchased six pairs of these is the inline remote and mic
I would be wearing them on a run, cleaning the house, or cooking enjoying my tunes or podcast when a call comes in
Not only would I avoid missing the call but I could answer it without even touching my phone
Just a click of the inline mic would take the call
The standard Apple earbuds are too uncomfortable to wear on long trips
The Skullcandy's come with two sizes of rubber fittings, allowing you to get a comfortable fit that doesn't fall out or ache over long periods of time
Great sound, great price
Highly recommended
This earphones are nicely built, relatively cheap and have great sound
They sound great, with deep bass, well leveled highs and good contour, and I can't hear any distortion in a regular volume level
The flat cord and the material it's built with are nice details too, helping me keep the cord from getting messy
I purchased these while in Afghanistan
I expected the shipping to take much longer but they got to me really quick
The earbuds are top notch
Amazing sound quality
They even suppress most of the outside noise
The microphone works like a charm
The only difference between these and the headsets that come with the iphone is that the iphone allows you to change the volume
With the increased sound quality and noise suppression that these give, screw the volume control
Highly recommended
These are ok
Nice long cable,and they work after a few months still
They are also pretty comfy
The sound is nowhere near as crisp as Apple Earpods
But for the price and considering I only use these at work,  they are fine
Next time though, I will probably just get another set of Earpods
Summary:Pros: Good audio quality, good bass response, very good build quality
Cons: Absolutely horrible mic, non-existent noise isolation, didn't come with 'large' eartip size
Details:Audio quality: Pretty good, no tearing, very good treble, excellent bass as claimed by manufacturer
Build quality: Looks very durable, love the flat cable
Looks very nice too
Mic: I have used the mic with 2 different phones, and once on my laptop, on all occasions, the person on the opposite end asked me to disconnect the mic in a few seconds, they either can't hear my voice loud enough, or have significant amount of noise
I purchased this so that I could have earphones with mic, that can be used everywhere, but it doesn't work for me
Button: Works fine, no issues here
Single button, works fine on an Android phone
Noise Isolation / eartip: Didn't come with the 'large' eartip set, came only with two sets, presumably the small and medium
I need the large, and the medium doesn't cut it for me, with regards to comfort and noise isolation
When I'm in a train or a train arrives while on the platform, I can't hear anything
I have a pair of Shures, when I'm using them, I can't even hear the train sometimes
I haven't tried these on a plane, but its pointless IMO
Overall: Very good build quality, very good audio quality
If that works for you, go for it
If you're looking for a good mic, or good noise isolation, then keep looking
I purchased with the intentions of using them during my workouts
At first I was disapointed by the sound quality; it sounded very muffled and plastic
However, after using them for an hour or so, the quality did get a lot better
I would even say they are as good as some 50+ dollar earphones
They are really durable and I have taken them into the sauna without a problem
The earphone jack connector was a little too big for my phone case but you can trim off excess rubber from the sides using a sharp razor blade
The headphones work great
Music sounds great, movies sound great, and even phone calls sound good
The problem is that the buttons do not work with my Nexus 4
Its not a huge issue as that was not a priority for me
But since it doesn't completely work, it doesn't deserve a completely perfect 5 star review
I own Skullcandy headphones so I thought I would try the earphones and I was pleasantly surprised at how great theses earphones sound
Wanted a cheap pair just to have in my work backpack so I wouldn't have to keep remembering my other pair
They work admirably but dont expect to stay in activity wise with sweat and such
They sound good enough although I dont use the mic on it so i cant comment on the quality
These headphones can pass for very high end headphones, the sound is very good, i am a bass person and these headphones hit hard, ive own'd many headphones my life and im at a school where people are always wearing headphones, so i will test them out to see whats better before i buy
I have listened to the big bose headphones and the big turtle beach headphones at my school and i have listened to these Skullcandies here as well, these headphones sound better than turtle beaches and are either equal too or greater than the bose headphones, i picked these over bose due to the great price on these headphones, if you folks want headphones that hit hard, here she is
I love these headphone
They are very comfortable and the noise cancelling is a little too good sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music at work
=) I only with they had volume control on the mic
The way that these were package caused kinks in the cord, which might have contributed to the hum and sound degradation
Printed off a return label and returned for a refund not 40 minutes later
I wasn't expecting these so soon
I love my purchase and the price I paid for them
The sound quality is awesome
I LOVE SKULLCANDY
Can't get much better than this for the price of the earbuds, they got to my house quick and I love them so far, totally recommend
I bought these headphones thinking they had the volume control also, but it is only the pause/fast forward/rewind button
other than that, the sound is good, and the price was good
I use these to workout in, sad to say that i had bought two different Beats earbuds headphones and both of them messed up
never paying that much for headphones again
You cannot go wrong these head phones
I paid somewhere around $18
00
Do not let the price sway you
In recent weeks I  wanted to replace my Bose quietcomfort first generation headphones
A price tag of $299, I would have never replaced them but found if you return your old pair you get a 50% discount
I went ahead and replaced
I use my quiet comfort headphones for watching movies on one my many tablets
Ear buds for walking about, mowing lawn ect
My stock samsung ear buds gave out, the search was on
I read many ear bud reviews at the price point I was comfortable with
Cnet, Headfi, Techcrunch all had good reviews for the Skullcandy product
I took a chance and glad I did
In comparison, if it were not for noise cancelling on the Bose, this product Skullcandy S2IKDY-003 in my humble opinion sound just as good
The bass is thumping without distortion, the highs are crisp
I use both of the aforementioned products with the creative sound blaster X-fi go pro usb sound card
Listening to music is a big part of my life
While I am no expert, I know good sound and this product simply delivers
Skullcandy is my favorite brand of earbuds / earphones
They fit snuggly in my ear, and rarely if ever cause any issues
I'm glad I was able to find the Ink'd line with the mic
I have two pair so that I can always leave on in my bag so I'm not without them on the go
The sound quality is great
I would recommend these to anyone who wants a good set of earbuds
Love these headphones, they look cool and they feel solid
Only thing I have to criticize is that the button on the mic doesn't change track or volume but no big deal
Sound quality is great as well
5/5 would buy again if mine ever breaks
Purchased these as a replacement for some terrible ear buds I had for awhile and after using them, I really understood what I was missing
These earbuds were much better with bass tones than my old ones and I enjoy listening to music much more now
The mic works great as well
Use it for work conference calls and have no issues
I will likely buy another pair to keep in the gym bag
As a Utahan I like to buy from a local company like Skull Candy, located in Park City, UT
My daughter goes through ear buds like crazy, I started buying her the Skull Candy because of the warranty
There is no hassle on returns if they stop working, they are great to work with
The buds themselves aren't the best you will hear but for a young teenager thy work great
Headphones are amazing
I had been buying the cheap ones at the dollar store of and over again until my daughter talked me into getting these
I bought two, one for here and one for me
I can't believe the difference
I will definitely buy again
If you want quality headphones, these are it
ive had multiple pairs of the inkd 2
0's
and every pair ive had i loved them
a couple pairs went through the washer and dryer and they still worked as good as when i first plugged them into my ipod
the best ear buds for 15 bucks, by far
I like them but the first one I ordered stopped working within 2 months
At first the left ear piece was going in and out
Withing the next couple of days it just stopped working
I ordered a 2nd pair through Amazon and so far still working with no problems
I will update if there is a problem or lack there of
And I sent my original pair to SkullCandy after filing a claim on there website
Hopefully they will send me a E-credit for there online store
I like them there comfortable they look kool there built great but the sound quality isent amazing my apple ear pods are better
I use these for jogging
They're light and they don't fall off my ears
I still have to test durability, but the seem pretty reliable
I guess that you get what you pay for
Its ok but I don't think they are very comfortable to be used for hours
They are a little to big and heavy
I like how it looks I don't like how they fell
These earbuds are perfect, ive had them for over a year and they still work perfectly
In fact the mic and control and everything still work as they always do even after being used completely submerged underwater countless times, I dont know how but they do
This is my second set of these exact headphones they serve the purpose that I need them for
Thinking of upgrading to the next level of Skull-candy phones for my smartphone though, solid great sounding headphones in a neat package
Sound quality is good for both listening and talking
I ride a motorcycle, and I use the earbuds as ear plugs, also
At highway speeds, the earbuds stay in your ears, but is a bit too noisy to enjoy music at those speeds
However, if you crank the volume, then you can hear instructions from your GPS, which is more important to me
There is no way to carry on a conversation on a cellphone while riding, but the sound quality when pulled off the road is excellent
I prefer wired earbuds to wireless
These are among the best
Would receive 5 stars, except the cord is very thin and do not expect them to last long
Feels like one good snag could result in failure
I always seem to be satisfied with skullcandy's products
I think these earbuds are a good product overall
Sound quality is good
They seem to fit snugly in my ears as well
The only con is that there is no volume button which I didn't realize when I purchased them
Other than that I'm satisfied
I liked it very much because the sound quality is amazing
Sounds great
Sounds like if your in your own world
I would recommend  this
(:
It is more usefull than I expected
perfect voice quality and mic
Unreal clear vocals that is amazing
If you are looking for ear plugs
You really should try these
thank you
These feel very durable
The ear pieces are a little stiff but other wise they are great
The cables are flat
Maybe to keep from tangling
Delivered to my door quickly and sooner than the expected delivery date
they fit comfortably in my ears (no pain or abrasion from the rubber piece part of the headphone
I will definitely buy another pair of these if/when these expire on me
Love the earlier version but they weren't durable at all, one side would blowoutBUT these are different
Love the flat cord and the high volume
Nice bass for some Ear Buds
Thinking of getting another pair in another color
Have been looking for mono-headphones to use with my smartphone as I am deaf in one ear
The sound quality has been excellent and from my conversations with others, the quality of sound transmitted by the microphone has also been first-rate
I have operated without headphones for so long that perhaps I had lowered my expectations, but I have been very pleased with this product
Well done
As long as you aren't some kind of audio snob, this yet of inexpensive buds really do the trick
Pros:Price is lowBass is deepMic works like a charmCables never knot and are a good lengthCons:After a few hours they can rub some people (ear size dependent)No volume rocker on the cord
I ordered those because I've only heard great things about Skullcandy, but those earbud headphones are just bad
The sound quality is worse than from my previous, cheap Apple iPhone imitation earbuds, the treble was painful in my ears, and when compared, was just bad
I live in the Caribbean, so sending back isn't an option for me, but if I could, I definitely would, and I don't think I'll ever buy Skullcandy again
Rather spend some more money and buy Bose, because I have owned earbuds from the major brands so far (Sony, Maxell, Philips, Apple), and all of them were by far better
Also, I hate how the earbuds are made these days, way too big, with those round rubber things that just wouldn't stay in my ears
I wish they would go back to producing the old designs, at least they stayed in my ear
Sorry Skullcandy, never again
My son (twenty years old) bought these for me for my birthday to replace my iPod
The old ones stopped working
Oh but son these blows the factory ear plugs away
My son has a pair that cost him over $100
00 He later heard these from one of his friends and he was blown away; They not only sounded as good as his
But was unreal cheaper
So YES I would highly recommend these to anybody
If you buy a pair and you see someone with the higher costing ones
You have got to let them listen to these and watch their faces seriously
These ear plugs bring out the best bass
Unreal clear vocals that is amazing
If you are looking for ear plugs
You really should try these
prefect sound
dropped them in the sink while working in the kitchen
full submersion
but they are still going strong
at 15 bucks this is a steal
kudos to skullcandy
w
These are cheap, sound good enough, travel well and work well with my galaxy III phone
I'm happy I bought them and now use them for when I travel and use another pair when I go to sleep to a movie so I don't bother my wife
I'm not an audiophile and don't want the sound completely blocked out and these little guys do a great job
These are comarable to many $30 dollar headphones I owned in the past
The only reason I would not give this product the last star is due to the in-mic feature and skipping songs
It doesn't actually work for me however I have to commend this for being able to amp a phone with beats audio and it serves its original purpose as ear phones
Overall, I do recommend this product but I'm just giving it the benefit of the doubt because I probably haven't figured out the  other features
Decent sound quality with these although I am not a picky person at all when it comes to sound quality
Stay in my ear pretty well and the microphone works with my Samsung Galaxy S4
I would recommend
great
product use them everyday
i love the way they sound
very stylish and look and sound amazing all the time
These are my second pair of this brand
The first pair I purchased last year, in August
I have never had a pair of earbuds last that long before
I love these because they fit comfortably in your ears and they have fantastic sound
Great earbuds
Got the Skullcandy ear phones with mic for a very reasonable price
So far I have been very satisfied with their performance, I highly recommend this item
I am a high school student that goes to PCEP (Plymouth-Canton educational park), this high school is actually three large high schools on one large campus and at this school you have to walk between schools for classes; so i lesten to music to pass the time of the comute between schools, my old headphones had just broken and i needed a new pair so i checked out customer reviews and these seemed like reliable headphones so i got them, Dont Get Them and ill tell you why, whenever you move and even when you dont your perverd music player will: fastforward, stop, skip songs, turn on voice control, etc
and there decently uncomfortable, there is one good thing to be said about these headphones is that they have amazing sound quality and are nearly soundprofed but these things cant be enjoyed while its malfunctioning so often
I bought and used them for when I walked to school and for when I ran
They stopped working in about 3 weeks
I would avoid getting these
This is your warning don't get these
i used it carefully , and within one month one side stopped working
not worth buying, please dont buy this product
I owned a pair of the last model of these headphones, and they held up through two plus years of everyday use before one of the wires frayed and they failed
Good value for the price
These new models sound great and work great, but they only come with small and medium gels
They fall out of my ears
What gives, Skullcandy
Do you really save so much money not putting the large gels in the package
I couldn't even order them off the Skullcandy website - spare gels aren't available
Luckily another seller on Amazon is selling them, but I shouldn't have to buy something like that in order to use my new headphones
I'm 6'5" tall and my ears are correspondingly large
There was no mention in the description of the new model not coming with the large gels
I deducted 1 star for the hassle and expense of ordering the gels that should have come with the product
the worst earbuds i have ever bought
I have gotten better ones from walmart for less money and free with devices
After 6 weeks, the audio cuts in and out with cord movement
Useless, don't buy
Would live to return them for credit but the return window has closed
Disappointed
Nice sounding, they have good bassgood pricegot here fasthella happy with these
well recommended, these are good
The headphones work well with good sounds and nice control for a good price, except that the cable, where the flat cable meets the plug, fails quickly especially if you have it in your pocket
I've gone through two pair and can't keep buying them due to this issue
I absolutely love these headphones
Especially love the tangle-free cord
Great sound quality
I also enjoy using the built in microphone and also the buttons on the cord to skip songs and control the volume
Great quality

Great quality
I do not know why Skullcandy hasn't included this as a feature, but the cords of the earphones are those tangle free ones
They do not get tangled when you are not seeing them
:)
High quality yet still inexpensive earbuds
They do a good job of cancelling out ambient noise and are not overly big in or on your ears liek other noise cancelling options
Albeit they won't completely block out all ambient noise like some of the over-the-ear options, they do a more than sufficient job
I've always liked Skullcandy and wasn't disappointed when I got these earbuds
Great sound, everything works flawlessly
I'd recommend Skullcandy to anyone who's gonna buy earbuds or headphones
Very Nice
I have them in right now and the mic is very sensitive and there is no defects
I love these and if they do break
Skullcandy has a lifetime warranty
The sound quality is better than beats
These are pretty bad headphones
I payed a little over $10 for them, in my mind, they are no better than a $5 pair from china town
No base, horrible audio quality, and uncomfortable in your ears
Not worth the money
The quality and usability I was looking for, thank you
I use them all the time to talk to people and listen to music whilst running
Great for the price
I like that it has the mic built in too
I'm able to pause/play music from it too
she wanted something like this for a while
she is pleased to beable to here and also speak when answering a phone call
I just love the Ink'd 2
0
I am using them as in-ear monitors for singers, and for personal listening pleasure
It's got some serious bass response, and it's got crisp clean sound
The price is incredible if you ask me
The only issue is when you turn them up too high - they start to lose the bass response and highs take over
That's normal however, for most headphones
Thing is, the Ink'd 2
0 reproduce sound louder than stock iPhone headphones for example, so you won't need to go higher than 90% where it starts to go crazy when using an iDevice
These are good quality headphones, however, I was misled because I thought the Mic on the cord included a volume control
It only contains ONE BUTTON that can stop, play, answer a call, end a call, etc
I'm kind of disappointed but I should have read the product description more
I've been using Skullcandy buds for a couple years now, mainly because of their lifetime warranty
I like the sound, but they have had a problem losing sound in one bud eventually
I just return to them and get another pair
I should mention here that I recently learned that their warranty system will only hold your credit for one year
Return it, get credit, and then use it within a year, or LOSE it
Also, if you have a return credit, it must all be used at once
Return a $70 pair, and use it all at once, or again, lose the difference
You can't use half today and the other half some other time
As for these buds, they seem built better than before
The wire is heavier and seemingly stronger
They must be getting tired of the returns
It could be me, but they even sound better
Nice deep bass during music plays and great clarity overall
The mic works very well and is heard noticeably better than my bluetooth for phone talk
Overall, these are a great value with or without the lifetime warranty
If these do last longer than what I've had in the past, they'll get 5 stars
I usually get headphones and they last like 4 months and one bud goes out and then I have to get new ones, But theses ones are very durable
I also like the flat cord
I think it looks cool
I bought these headphones about two months ago and they are already broken
I can not stress this more: If you want durable, quality headphones, DO NOT buy these
The same problem occurred with these that occurred with all other Skullcandy headphones I have owned: Lack of strain relief
The sound completely cut out of one ear after two months of daily use
The only possible redeeming factor to these headphones is that they are not uncomfortable to wear
However, it is entirely possible to get the same comfort (and sound quality) in a pair of headphones that will last a reasonable amount of time
The lack of durability and quality, two of the most important properties in headphones and other electronics, makes these headphones a complete waste of money
I will not buy another pair of these headphones and neither should you
These are good, but sometimes I feel very hard in my ear
I get pain sometimes
Ear buds are not very soft as others
For the price I thought these were a good deal
The music has a nice sound quality to it and the buds fit comfortable
My only complaint is that I now notice some static when listening to video podcasts with them on
I do not know if this is an issue with the headphones or on how the podcast was released
I do know I never noticed the static before but it has not limited me from using them
If they hold up over an extended period of time I would definitely consider ordering these again
Needed headphones, saw how cheap they were, and snagged 'em
They have good bass, and the quality is pretty good, I'd definitely get another one
I am not a fan of single ear Bluetooth devices
I prefer two ear wired
These earphone do a pretty good job for phone calls as well as listening to music
one ear piece not working, muffled sound, one side works but the other does not work well, muffled sound, cannot use
Back story: I am involved in recording and studio work
I am used to my beyerdynamic DT770s and my event monitors
I have owned these a day or so
First impressions are not good
They are much like other skull candy products: lots of bass and treble
The mids are very undefined, but they are present and accounted for
Ill keep listening and check back after some burn in time
I had some of the headphones given to me as a gift and I liked them so much I have purchased two more
Time of use at review - Months (ish)PROs - nice clear sound, love the micCONs - not really a con, but the flat cable to the earbuds might be something people might find different
RATING - 5 stars, works as advertisedRECOMMEND - Yes, I bought these for my friends daughter and she loves them
if you dont want to spend a ton of money on beats then get these they sound great and last a long time
I really liked these i really love the price for them feel really comfortable, "tangle-free" and the best part is the amount i paid and i got a lot more than i expected
With just a bass boost app you're good will sound great because of the great big 11mm speaker it packs
I really love the new design on the Skullcandy ear buds
I run every day on my lunch and they never come out of my ears
I love the controls on the cord
Great product
Very nice headphones and I also love the fact theres a built in mic since I listen to my music thro my galaxy its very easy to answer a call with a simple click
Ive had them now for a couple months and Im very rough on headphones and theses seem to be well built and the flat cord is what helps I thnk
Deff order another set when needed
Nice earbuds
We are pleased with this product
It arrived to our satisfaction and on time
They are good quality earbuds
Happy Listening
What I got was sub-par
I don't know if it was a shipping problem but whatever it was
But the sound wasn't good
And half of the microphone casing was missing
I would rate it 0 but they don't let you
The right earplug didn't cancel out noise at all
The sound is pretty decent, but when I put it in, the left earplug fit snugly
The right earplug went in, but my ear didn't really wrap around it
And when I was listening to music while being driven, I could hear the radio that was coming from the car speakers clearly
Most likely the best earbuds in it's price range
Astounding quality
Yes better quality than regular Ink'ds
I'm extremely impressed
These ear buds will last you about one month if you are lucky
The the right ear bud broke on the past two I've bought
Waste of money
Recommend buying a better pair for slightly more
I've had these for plenty of months now, no wear and tear
They're loud and barely tangle in your pockets
They keep the same quality and throughout the rough wearing, it still looks brand new
Loving the amazing gold color plated connector
Initially, I was surprised by the great sound emitted by these fairly inexpensive headphones
Unfortunately, "cheap" translated to the build quality as well
After two short weeks, the left earbud came apart
I keep the headphones in a special pocket in my backpack and my jeans backpack
I am able to reattach the earbud, but the sound is gone completely
I like this product
It has many sizes for you ears
Sound is good and clear
Only problem when you try to talk through it the people your talking to care barely understand you
THESE CAME TO ME WITH PIECES MISSING AND DID NOT WORK
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT
IT IS AN INFERIOR PRODUCT
NOT SATISFIED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AT A GREAT PRICE
Used daily on walks with the dog, after a month they stopped working completely
Go elsewhere, these have the bad habit of breaking quickly
I use these on planes and they are wonderful
The noise isolation and sound is excellent and they fit my ears perfectly
Previously I used noise canceling earbud headphones, but have since stopped bringing them on trips
I don't need noise canceling when I have these
The flat cord doesn't tangle either
For around $20, they are also a good value
The mic is good too, but I primarily use these for listening
This is my second pair gave the first to my wife to use for hands free operation in the car and she loves it, audio quality is good enough for me and at the price even better
Has fulfilled all of my daily needs when it comes to listening to music and talking
I'm 100% pleased with skullcandy
Poduct will not stay in my ear
I've tried all the different iterations, doesn't matter
Won't stay in
I'm not satisfied
I thought they were pretty good until the left side went out today
I will not be repurchasing, since I know in another eight months I'll just have to replace them
Pros:- They are comfortable, I could wear them for a long time without my ears hurting
- The noise cancelling was good
*See "Cons" for additional info on this
- Small enough to carry around in your bag or pocket
Cons:- They do not last long
(Nothing does anymore, it seems)- I could hear some "static", which was presumably the noise cancelling feature
My previous headphones (a different, over-the-ear brand) did not do this, and they were better at doing the job than these
After awhile I did get used to it, but sometimes it still irritated me
great for the price, i got it for $13
the stock squishies are crap, get some bluecell memory foam tips to go with it
i put it through the tone generator and got a little background buzzing an 400 through 500 hz
thats about the most frequently used range in a lot of music unfortunately but its minor enough so that i dont notice it
it also has a ringing above 20,000hz but music will rarely go that high
it seamed to go down to 5hz, i couldnt hear it but i can feel it at hing volumes and thats normal
it looses 2 stars for the ear tips and the buzzing but they are great for the price
ill update this later when i know more about the durability
i used to love these earbuds headphones or their quality now it is like they blow out in a day, i dont know if ill be buying more
The good:Sound quality is pretty good for the price
These headphones were definitely an upgrade from those supplied with my Note II
Decent bass for earbuds
I also like the flat cables
This feature does make them less likely to get tangled
The bad:When used with my phone, I get quite a few complaints that my voice is muffled
So, I feel safe saying that the mic isn't so great
The ugly:3
5mm jack and housing are failing after a few months
I am getting a lot of static and crackling when any pressure is applied to the area where the cable meets the jack
It doesn't take much either
To me these seem to tangle easier then the old round wire ones
Great sound and do what they need to
Satisfying sound quality
Haven't owned many other earbuds to compare to, but these get the job done
I keep them in work laptop bag for when I need sound at the office
Also work well with my phone
ok
They stay in my ears much better than the last pair of phones I had, but the sound quality is not there
I would not recommend
These are great
Mine have been through the washer AND dryer, twice
Still work great
Also work well for phone calls
I didn't even realize they had a microphone until today
Good quality headphones and mic
There is no volume control though
If it had one, I would give it 5 stars
As it, it's just middle of the road
These are great headphones but they (the black ones specifically) do not have a mic :( Not sure if I was sent the wrong ones or if that's why they're the cheapest color
Poduct will not stay in my ear
I've tried all the different iterations, doesn't matter
Won't stay in
I'm not satisfied
After trying many different types of ear buds, I am very happy with Skullcandy
The sounds quality is great
They appear to cancel other noises
The ear buds stay in place while working out at the gym
It is nice to have the volume control on the wire
I do notice I go through a pair a year since the plastic around the ear buds get gross after a year, but again I am using daily in a gym
pros : durable, good sound quality, good build quality, tangle proof
cons: wish it had volume controller
Also when you put it in your pocket the ear buds rubber fall off sometimes
other than that its a great buy for your buck
Sound quality is really great
Great lows and highs, blocks out all noise
Gotten them wet a few times from rain, still works perfectly
Thrown around quite a lot
From my work bag to my house
I use it on my computer and phone works great
Flat cord, lessens the chance for the wire to get pulled out
So far works really great
Only thing I have issues with is the mic
Most people can't really hear me when I use it unless it's right next to my mouth, even then it doesn't work but still a great buy
I would buy it again definitely
First of all the sound quality of these ear buds is very solid
The fit nicely and block outside noise
On the other hand, however, I received these headphone on September 26 and after three days and maybe seven uses the part of the headphones with the speaker that the rubber earpiece attaches to broke off from the housing
It is still attached by two wires and they still play music
Overall solid headphones they're just not held together very well
I choose this rating because it suits my needs
Perfect the way I wanted it
I don't get pain in the ear no more
I like his style and the rubbers at he end to fit your ears good
Yes i do recommend it
As a big Skullcandy earbud fan, I think this is the best pair I have purchased so far
They don't irritate my inner ear and the microphone is convenient, especially because it also contains the volume control
I highly recommend Skullcandy products
These earbuds are much more comfortable than iphone earbuds and stay put
These do not ache after use like the iphone earbuds and do not fall out when running
I bought these to both serve as earbuds for exercising with my iPod and for using with my android phone for hands-free calls in my daily commute to work
These are perfect for both
As a plus, I also use them with my iPad for watching TV shows and movies
I find the clarity and bass response to be excellent
Another big plus is the cord untangles very easily because it is flat instead of rounded
This is truly one of their best unheralded features
They are very comfortable as earbuds go and have longer than average cord length, which is a big benefit for when I use them at work, connected to my laptop
Really great earbuds for the money
I'm delighted with my purchase
It works really well with my samsung android phone, other headphones typically make my phone flip out and lose control but these headphones work perfectly, Id recommend them for anyone
Good quality headphones and mic
There is no volume control though
If it had one, I would give it 5 stars
As it, it's just middle of the road
These are great headphones but they (the black ones specifically) do not have a mic :( Not sure if I was sent the wrong ones or if that's why they're the cheapest color
These headphones have good sound quality and are great for regular everyday use such as commuting on the train or bus, watching videos and movies on your smartphone or tablet
However, I don't recommend that you use them while exercising
Whether you're biking, running, or lifting weights, these headphones have the tendency to slip out and require constant adjustment
Also, they're not that durable
After about a month of regular use while exercising, the left year bud's sound has become quieter than the right
i'm assuming it's because sweat got in there and messed with the internal components
I bought these headphones with the hope they would work with my work laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad) - unfortunately I wasn't able to get them configured/these are not compatible with this laptop to use the headphone AND microphone feature
As some other reviews note, while the package includes differently sized earphone covers, I can't wear these for a prolonged amount of time without experiencing some discomfort
However, buying in ear headphones is always a hit and miss venture
What doesn't work for the shape of my ear may be great for someone else
I do use these with my Samsung Galaxy S4 to take phone calls and listen to music while I'm running
They perform great with my phone - I can use the headphone and microphone feature without any issues
I prefer putting one ear bud in to use while I'm driving (per CA state laws) versus my bluetooth headset and haven't had any complaints as far as call quality or outside noise
Ive been using these for about a month at work
I work in a factory for 8 hours a day and these headphones hurt after a while
I used to have jvc marshmallows and I could wear those forever and they didn't hurt at all
The sound is not that good and they constantly fall out of my ear and the mic isn't bad but its not great
I recommend jvc marshmallows which is what I am going to get again very soon
One earbud stopped working within 100 to120 hours of use
Verified it was the earbuds by using multiple devices and another headset
skull candy always delivers great sound for the price
we have tons of these all over the house and in all our bags
mic always works well
Based on the reviews I read around the 'net, I figured these were great headphones (for the money), so I bought two pairs
boy was I wrong
The sound quality is terrible, and everyone tells me that the mic cuts in and out
Plus, no answer/hangup button on the cord
JVC Marshmallows are soo much better, found some at Fry's so we've gone back to them
Broke
Didn't last long before the one side stopped working
Clicker also failed eventually
Wasn't sad when I lost them
The Skullcandy brand has always produced some nice earphones and earbuds, and the Ink'd 2
0 definitely doesn't fall short of my expectations from this brand
These earbuds have very clear tones, especially with acoustics
The bass with them is good, but I have heard better before
With the price that these earbuds are at, though, I definitely can't complain, because they sound really nice and I use them daily
Overall, if you want some great earbuds, but don't want to spend $50 or more, these are a great option for you
Highly recommend
These have great sound quality and also help damper alot of the background noise
It is perfect for anyone (like me) who works in an office cube
These are okay but lack in bass
The Skullcandy headphones that are similar to the iPhone headphones are better for bass but these stay in your ears better
It just depends on what you are looking for
Came in good condition, pretty good
no defects or anything
Good quality headphones like these will last you a long time
I bought these to replace my Urban Earbuds that broke about 3 months after purchasing
The price on those were about $34 and after I tried to take advantage of the "lifetime warranty" that doesn't exist in reality I opted to try something new
I use these for my morning and evening commutes so they do get a lot of use and so far so good
The sound is clear and better than the Urban Ears although sometimes if I'm walking at a brisk pace they do fall out of my ears
I would not recommend these if you plan on using them to exercise or do physical activity
I love the cord design because it is flat and doesn't tangle easily
The microphone works well although I do wish that it also had a volume option but I guess I can do without it for the price
Overall they are a good buy and I would definitely choose the Skull candy brand over Urban ears any day
I bought a set of these at the airport as I had forgotten my own
They were SO uncomfortable it was almost unbearable
They got me through the movie I wanted to watch on the plane, but my ears were so sore afterwards
I would 100% not recommend these earphones to anyone
These earbuds/mic work great
I am a casual user of handsfree
They aren't the best quality but they are perfect for my usage
I ordered for a headphone with mic
The one that I got doesn't even have a mic
Don't konw how ppl ship it without even seeing the description
These headphones were awesome
too bad the left earbud stopped working about 4 months after I bought them They had great sound, awesome bass, and listening to music was very enjoyable with them
I just wish they would have lasted longer
But hey, I get what I pay for with headphones under $20, right
I'm a big fan of Skullcandy and recently my old headphone set with these
They stay in my ears better than most pairs (which I've had a problem with in the past), but I've noticed 2 things
1) I can hear the headphones moving (a dull thudding sounding of them hitting up against my ear or shoulder as a run) and 2) this might be my fault, but I can't seem to figure out how to use the buttons near the earphones to increase the volume of my music or call
This was easy on my last model, but seems to hang up the phone now
I still like them and use them and I'm not likely to replace them, but I can't say I'm "100% satisfied"
You get what you pay for
these stopped working in less than a month
However, Titan by Skullcandy have proven to be much better quality
Good sound quality and good bass
The mic is also great
The price is justified
I totally recommend this product
I ordered these and apple head phones because I didn't know which one was better so why not try both
Well after trying these while at the gym I came to the conclusion that I did not like them
They go really far into your ear, which hurts
They suction to block out outside sound and ends up hurting your ear drum
I can't imagine it being good for your hearing to have that much sound so close to your eardrum
I would not order them again
The apple ear phones win in this case
There is a malfunction with these headphones
When the speaker button is press to activate either calls or music it automatically chooses the function that you did not choose
For example, it will automatically dial the last phone number without you making the call or wanting to make a call
When i ordered these headphones i expected to be rocking out to awesome tunes
Instead, I am now looking at myself through a small heart shaped, sticky on one side, mirror
Why this company thinks that mirrors and headphones are the same, i know not
When i attempted to stick one of the mirrors to my ear in the hopes of WiFi or Bluetooth enabled headphones, i was disappointed to find that not only did it not have audio drivers of any sort, i now had a strawberry mirror stuck to my ear
However horrible my experience was, the company did refund me completely, though i may want to sue for emotional scarring as having a mirror glued to your ear is quite possible the most disturbing thing in the world
Arrived in condition described as quick
I don't love these headphones for running as I can hear the cords shifting and thumping, but that is not the sellers problem
The buds have a good ear seal and are great for use on planes and when not in action
Sound quality is good, and they do last quite awhile
Bad news is that if you use them in a gym or for physical activity, know that the sticky rubber-like material that the cord is made of sticks to almost everything, especially skin
So even though there may not be anything restricting the cord's ability to move around, it won't flow with your movements, leading to the never pleasant feeling of earbuds being yanked from your ears unexpectedly, even during a weight set
This is unacceptable
Sound on these headphones is fine, but mic is almost useless with my Nexus 4
People are always complaining they can't hear me
I would not recommend
good sound quality and the mic works great on these headphones
if u want good sound and a cheap price these are it
I like it a lot, nice style with a lot of choices colors plus the sound is amazingIts worth what I paid for :)
I bought these to serve me as a handsfree for my Nexus 4
They are awesome as headphones with a nice bass and great sound, and the microphone is decent at least, however they provide way too much insulation, regardless of the buds that you're using
If you plan on using them as both headphones for music and a handsfree while you're walking, jogging and everything else, they are a prime choice for the price, however when you're driving they stop too much of the outside sound for a safe drive

Product as described, price was about the same as our local retail store but having Amazon Prime makes it easier than having to make a trip out to get them
I've used them almost daily since purchase and they feel like they'll hold up for some time
I would purchase again from this retailer
***THIS IS A REVIEW FOR ONES I GOT FROM BEST BUY*****the ones I got from amazon
com were NOT that great
I bought two; one didn't even last a week
The 2nd pair fared better; TWO weeks
**These were great for me
The fit perfectly in my ears and provide excellent comfort and noise isolation
i was always wary about skullcandy because I thought they were cheap and HATED the logo which are right there on the earbuds and kind of stick out
I don't like bringing attention to myself
But after trying them out for the first time, they're really good and I was very pleasantly surprised
I wear earphones ALL THE TIME
Because of that, my earphones get a lot of abuse from getting caught on things to being twisted and crushed and rolled on when I'm in bed
These amazingly and surprisingly lasted months for me when most earphones barely make it 30-60 days before cutting out
I would recommend at 100% except that I'm pretty sure I just got lucky with mines
*If you've read this far, then you know that perhaps I WAS just lucky, because the ones I got from amazon to replace the Best Buy pair have totally SUCKED
*BUT, despite the bad luck with my current pair, I still think these are good earbuds and are a good price
I've lost these headphones 3X and each time have just gone on the mobile app and did the 1-click buy
Easy decision
Better sound than the previous model of Inkd'
They are the only slim connector headphones that will fit the maxboost external battery case without the extension
Only complaint I have (minor one) is that they tend to work their way out during long workouts (over 2 hours)
Overall they're excellent, I don't mind readjusting the buds once per workout, not really an inconvenience at all
The product is what I expected it to be and it is perfect
Thank you and good job
Great for road trips
I was excited about these: Good sound for the price, inline remote (although no volume control), relatively low cable noise--all essential for my daily bike commuting and jogging
Also, if embossed skull logos on every conceivable surface aren't your thing, the good news is they're pretty subtle on the dark colors
However, these earbuds failed disappointingly quickly
The left bud fell out once and the plastic housing actually broke when it landed on the table
(I've been able to simply jam it back, and a drop of superglue would fix it for good
) More frustrating still, within a month of regular use, the remote has stopped working, and the connection at the jack is causing popping and cut-outs
Can't recommend them
Too bad
I chose these headphones for one reason, in the description of the product they are described as having a "1
3-meter nylon braided cable with gold-plated 3
5mm plug"
They DO NOT have a braided cord
Instead they have a cheap, really thin flat plastic cord
The sound is ok, but nowhere near worth the $16 they're charging
I'm returning them immediately
As the title says, I liked the earphones
I mostly bought it for the remote attached to it and its price but both earbuds stopped working really quickly in about 3-4 months
I would've loved it if the durability was better
These things actually sound pretty good for the price
I was not expecting the bass and clarity
I would recommend if you are looking for something you dont mind losing, but you want them to sound good too
Good buds for the price, stays in the ear pretty well - shares the amazing ability to tie themselves up in knots when you are not looking, like all good earbuds do
I've tried many brands and these are hands down the best
They stay in the ear very well
They are made of a high quality, silicone like material
They look good and provide great sound
Highly recommended
Got these for my android phone
they sound great for music
but in calls they are lacking
either these are faulty or this mic just sucks
had high hopes
but really let down
I've tried a few headphones from different providers looking for good sound and durability
All my previous headphones couldn't survive my daily exercise
walking
The cords would fray and the sound for both music and phone calls would become annoyingly noisy with static
So far these skullcandy are holding up to simple walking without crying uncle and being sent to headphone heaven
It's still early but so far so good
Right now I would say good quality for a good price
These do not fit my daughter's ears
or mine
I love Skull candy, conceptually very cool but if you are jogging or fast walking keeping these in your ears is impossible
I spend more time adjusting them and keeping them in and less time losing myself in my run
Kills the purpose
Maybe it is just me, and my daughter
but I will stick with the factory provided ear bud's which have never given me an issue
Very well crafted however, and they look great so I will give them 3 stars based on that alone
Pros:Great sound quality for an inexpensive pair of earbuds
Inline Mic and mute buttonTangle-free cordCons:It feels like a expendable pair of earbuds
The silicone covers are a little uncomfortable after a while of use
This is pretty comfortable earphone that I've ever used
I've been using it for about 8 months, and it's really good compare to the price that I bought
I wish they wouldn't break so easily, in a month, one side of the earphones completely stop working I bought a next one and the same thing happened
The sound quality is amazing though, the only problem is the part where one side just stops working after a month
I used these earphones with Samsung Galaxy s3 if this is useful
These have very good base and seem like a quality product
Extremely happy I purchased and I have had no issues
I have been using these for a few months now
I bought these because I'm not really an audiophile, I just wanted something cheap that worked, which it does just fine
I'm giving it four stars because of the fit in my ear, which might not be totally fair because maybe my ears are just strange, but I can only call it as I feel it
I was buying them to replace the ones that came stock with my S4, which fit really nicely and stayed in forever with no discomfort
In contrast, after having these on for a long time and taking them off, my tragus was a bit tender for a while
That said, this was only after hours of leaving them in, which I don't usually do
The vast majority of times, it's fit well, felt fine, and sounds decent, at least to my non-audiophile ears
I usually need to buy a pair of headphones every month because they would either break or fall apart
But not Skull Candy
These are amazing
I've had them for 6+ months and they work like brand new
It's a little pricey, yes but your paying for a good quality, long lasting headphone
Money well spent and highly recommended
Pros: Bass hits HARD
These headphones bump
Cons: Mic SUCKS
Person on the line can hear everything in the background louder than they can hear you
Good sound, fit, and call quality out-of-the-box
However: sound is already getting crackly and distrorted after only 2
5-months of commute-only use; no exercise use (and associated sweat damage
) Will probably attempt a replacement, or just shift to Bluetooth headphones
There are 3 reasons I love these:1
Good sound for the price
2
The ear piece shape fits better than all the others for me and blocks out sound the best
3
The flattened shape of the chord resists tangling
Why don't all ear buds learn from these great innovations
these things will not last you more then 2 weeks
do yourself a favor and do not buy these
they are JUNK
I paid $24 for these as a replacement to my beats in ears that lasted a year
These are the worst earbuds ever
The custom for is either too small or too big so they call out after 2 mins of running
The push button freezes so it either pauses mid workout or Siri comes on for no reason
If you're just sitting there listening to music then they are alright but there's no volume control so you have to leave your player out
Not worth the money no matter how cheap
Plays perfectly, durable, fell in water twice and still works
would recommend to anyone else to get a pair of these head phones
One of the earbuds stopped working within 2 weeks
But I guess you get what you pay for
Next time I'll spend a little more for better quality
Had to change the rating from 4 to 1 because the mike stopped working after 2 months
--------I mainly using it for making calls not much for music
The mike could be better, u need to hold the mike close to ur mouth for clear conversation
Sound-wise, these are the best earbuds I've ever had
Nice bass, good reproduction of other ranges
The non-tangle design works great
I've managed to get the beginnings of a knot in them twice in a month - that compares to getting actual knots into other earbuds more than twice a day
The microphone works well
It does pick up other sounds going on around, so it is not useable in all situations, e
g
, when the AC in my car is on the person I'm talking to can hear it, so I either put the mic right up close to my mouth, with my hand around it to dampen out the noise, or I turn off the AC
So I'm very happy with these earbuds
They are much better than I was expecting
I ordered Skullcandy  Ink'd 2
0 Earbuds and I received the old version
Called Amazon and all they would do is send me a shipping label to send them back and then I would have to re-order the correct ones
Very disappointed I did not get what I ordered after spending extra for the newer version
I have hearing issues and this product works great for me (audio books and music)
My teenage son's have several pairs as well (mostly for music and movies)Great product - I travel over 100,000 air miles a year, these headphones make flights, as well as layovers in airports a much better experienceI'm past the half century mark in age , but good products sell regardless of the name 'Skullcandy' which  is clearly targeted for the younger folksKeep up the great work, I'll pass on the word regarding SK headphones
BTY I've tired lots of earphones and find yours the best regarding performance, cost, and ruggednessThanksE
G
I like the headphones and the sound great
I recommend Skullcandy over Beats
Prepare yourself for a really great sound
I had skullcandy previously as well and was always satisfied
The jack broke while trying to use on Airplane
Ordered new set and all set
I am not one to normally write a review, but this item has made me angry enough so I can warn others
First off I want to post this link: B003HKTWKOThat is the old ear buds I had but they finally wore out and I seen they had a new version and I wanted to get it
Since the one w/ the mic was the same price as the one without, I figured I would get it
The sound is the exact same on both of them
It being Skullcandy you will know it has superb quality
The mic is a basic mic that can work with normal handheld electrics that can auto-detect a mic and it works well
My voice comes through fairly crisp and it does its job
That's where the good news ends
My problem with these "newer" ones is the design
If you compare these to the ones I linked you can see they changed the design on it
The older ones curve downward to snuggle into your ear and fit into it
These do not curve at all
They are made of a harder plastic than the other ones
They will cut into your ear if you wear them often and you will bleed
They aren't meant to fit into your ear like the other one
They are meant to cut into your ear so they can stay in place
After a month or so I started to get severe pain in my ears
Eventually I seen it had cut the insides up and I did end up getting a ear infection in both ears
So just beware if you get these
They have great sound, but they hurt over a long period of use
I do not suggest getting these
I highly suggest getting the older ones
Hell, I ordered myself another pair of them and already enjoy them
the first time I tried these i thought I had just wasted my money
I'd call myself an ''audiophile wannabe'' because I've never owned a high end sound system, but I always try to get the best sound out of the ones I can afford
When I tried this on the first time I was very disappointed because the sound was truly terrible, in the first songs I played some sounds overlapepd others, and there was so little bass that I thought the earphones had a terrible sound range
So I tried a different song, Maria maria by Carlos Santana
and the Ink'd responded good, which was strange, but being the only headphones I had for traveling i kept hearing through them all day
Turned out after all, the next day they sounded great
just like that
Apparently they needed some ''burn in'' which I wasn't familiar with because my older headsets sounded great out of the boxNow about other things:-The microphone is excelent, even if I'm in my laptop using skype, my friends say they listen to me a LOT better with the Ink'd's mic-The cord is flat and it helps a lot to prevent tangleing, and definitely improves untangleing, my old CX300II used to become a mass of cable after just leaving them on the table-the music control is ok, sometimes I have trouble making a double tap for next song, resulting in pause and play back, but thats probably my fault :)overall i give them 4 stars, they sound pretty good ~once they burn in~, have a excelent microphone, and for the price they're a very good choice, I won't say the best but I would buy them again
These are the best sounding earbuds I have gotten so far, I listen to lots of audio books, and these have the best sound quality and have lasted the longest so far
This is my second pair, my first pair I am still using, just reordered so that I had another pair if the first pair got damaged, I am rough on them, and they get tangled up on stuff, when i am wearing them, especially if I only have one in my ear
When I do listen to music with them, its great sound
I also use them when making phone calls, people say the ear me just fine
I would recommend this product
Great for the price, and the only downside is that I have to sometimes hold the mic a little closer to be heard
I always have problems with mics picking me up (Xbox 360 headsets, PC headsets, handset speakerphones
you name it, I'm too soft-spoken or something)
These things do the job I need them to though, and they sound good doing it
They're durable too - I've accidentally stood up while these are plugged into my laptop, ran over them with my office chair, and you can't tell a bit
They should be broken and gross, but they're not
The headphones work great
Music sounds great, movies sound great, and even phone calls sound good
The problem is that the buttons do not work with my Nexus 4
Its not a huge issue as that was not a priority for me
But since it doesn't completely work, it doesn't deserve a completely perfect 5 star review
I own Skullcandy headphones so I thought I would try the earphones and I was pleasantly surprised at how great theses earphones sound
I got these on sale at best buy on black Friday for 10$
Thought they wouldn't be good for price
They are BOSS
When you play music they are almost noise cancelling
I wear them at swim meets (which are really loud) and sometimes I can't heat anything but my music
GET THEM
My experience with skullcandy has been a boss one
l
They are okay but not the best headphones
After a few weeks of use they started shorting out a little bit so I'm not sure how long they'll last
These headphones rock
I love my new pair; the clarity and the bass in these headphones are amazing and I use them with my Iphone 5
I recommend spending the extra bucks on the mic because it is nice to have in case you are driving and need the lightweight headset
I was impressed with the earbuds that came with iphone 5 until i listend to my friends skullcandies then i had to boss up ;  I immediately made the purchase
Gotta stay handsfree so you dont get pulled over and these are simple and lightweight coming with 2 sized ear pieces depending on personal preference
The microphone version is lightweight, simple and has a great warranty
They stand behind their product
not to mention i got  the item free with amazon gift card dollars  i earned from instant gift cards
(if u like swagbucks you will love this) look up instant gift cards on google and add me as your referral please username: KIEREKULOFT we both earn points for each other
Free is good
Great headphones, good quality
Shipping was awesome and the price was right
I just absolutely love the skullcandy headphones
I use them for everything webcaming, biking, etc
I also like the thinness of the wire
I love everything about these headphones
Glad I purchased this product
They really served my needs
Definitely satisfied with my purchase of this headphones by skullcandy
Sound is very clear and sharp for the price
Nice look and convenient button for use with Android
Much better than my previous headphones, which cost twice as much
Though the microphone clicker never worked from the start with my GS3 the earbuds themselves seem to have good enough sound quality
I am also noticing after only a few weeks that the place where the cord meets the headphone jack is starting to show some wear and I will likely be replacing them within a few weeks
Overall, I am much happier with the $5 Samsung GS3 OEM earbuds I purchased as well and will likely not buy these again
These are my 4th or 5th pair of Skull Candy headsets
Each pair are made well, put up with a beating, and sound great
The bass is enough to satisfy, but not loud enough to make you deaf
I bought this in October 2012 and they are amazing the sound is perfect and bass is increased a lot from the ifrogz i had, the mic is really helpful and u can talk on the phone hands free my mic started to act up at the end of January 2013 b/c i fell asleep listening to music and during my sleep i guess i pulled the cord
The cord has a little bit of grip and the connecting end has like a hard cover to protect the wires inside from being pulled to easly like with cheap head phones which then causes sound to fade away sometimes or completly makes one side broken so now u gata walk around with one earbud
Basically this head phones will prevent that from happening they are the best
They work very well and they I haven't taken them to the gym yet but I don't think they will fall out
The product is quite nice considering the mic function along with the button to skip, pause, or whatever, single function, the earphones are decent, they have nice bass I like using the small buds they seem to give my ears a nicer bass and it has high hats so i keep my ipod in the equalizer mode in Bass Boost, so i get a higher bass, because i love bass and high hats, it sounds nice
I definetly recommend this product
Great quality headphones
the sound is so clear
I'm a really big music fan, so I use them on my iPod and iPhone and works awsome,
I like these headphones, and the bass is terrific on both the music and podcasts that I listen to on them
But I don't love them
I found the small covers to be too small, and the design went too far down my ear canal, causing me to feel nauseous without knowing why at first
The large covers are a little to big to be comfortable
I suspect that the medium sized covers will be just right, but they didn't come with this version, so I need to order the additional covers for an additional $3
50 to find out
If they had 3 sizes of covers, why not include all 3 in the package, so I'd know which ones to get more of
I love the cord itself
On cheap headphones, the cord feels flimsy, which I find is a huge reason they don't last very long
This cord is anti-kink, and in freezing weather doesn't cause problems
And these have a microphone on one of the two speaker lines that seems to pick up my muffled voice pretty darn well
I haven't even had complaints yet about background noise on my train
Update:  I ordered the medium rubber covers
They fit terrifically
With appropriate headphone covers, these are 4-star earbuds
The sound quality is good for listening to music and the remote works well
I have the flat cable type and they don't tangle
I can not use them for phone calls
If there is any minor background noise, I can't be heard on calls
Don't hold well in the ears
Keeps falling out
Sound is nice
Would not purchase again
Does not stay on ears
Do not purchased very cheap product
Must handle with care or ear plugs separate from the wire
They lasted 2
5 weeks
Dont let the name Skullcandy make you think good product
HA
Okay so i m a 15 year old and music is a huge part of my life and i bought my first skull candy headphones a few years ago, and those ones ended up failing on one side
I have gone through 5 PAIRS of these headphones and every time they just stop working on one side
My dad had the same problem with his and he takes AMAZING care of his electronics
The sound is amazing and these are very comfortable but don't buy it without knowing you will have to buy one withing the next 4 months
the longest mine lasted was 3 months
So go for it if you think you can take PERFECT care of them and just know side will eventually fail
They have a really clear sound for music, people can hear me clearly when im talking in the mic, no problems
don't buy this junk it was broken when delivered to me
microphone isn't working and it has no sound in right bud
i regret that i bought this piece of junk
Let me start by saying that I am a Skullcandy snob
I love their earbuds and find them the most comfortable brand for my small ears
I was excited when I discovered they sold earbuds with microphones, and quickly ordered a pair to use with my phone
When they arrived, I tested them out with my Ipod and found that they sounded great
Unfortunately, using them to talk on the phone was not so great
Whenever I spoke to someone through this set, my caller complained that I was "breaking up
"  Not only that, but because the earbuds are so snug (fit slightly differently than typical skullcandies), I felt like I was talking under water
I couldn't hear myself well and found I'd raise my voice to talk, not that the caller could hear me anyway
All in all a disappointing purchase
I got these on sale at best buy on black Friday for 10$
Thought they wouldn't be good for price
They are BOSS
When you play music they are almost noise cancelling
I wear them at swim meets (which are really loud) and sometimes I can't heat anything but my music
GET THEM
My experience with skullcandy has been a boss one
l
Audio quality is excellent
But it isnt tangle proof, not that its a big problem for me
Now to see if its as durable as advertised
Great product, however there is sometimes an echo of your voice about a half a second or so when speaking
Very good product for the average user
Don't expect anything top-of-the-line because lets face it, these are cheaper-ish headphones
Great build to themthough
Good value although sound feels a bit muffled to me
Overall decent sound and mic works well for its purpose
I have no complaints with the sound quality
It's the usual great audio quality I have come to expect from Skullcandy
I only gave it 3 stars because I do have issues with the button functions of the buds
The mic works okay but the button is supposed control volume, skip forward/backward, play/pause and dial
I'm not sure why but only the play/pause button works with my HTC Evo Design 4g
I have read that other customers had similar issues also
Whenever I try to use the multiple click function for anything other than dial or play/pause it only dials the last number I called
I have read other reviews where others have downloaded additional apps to solve this issue but I haven't tried it yet
I needed a pair of headphone to listen to music on my Smart phone
I can use these headphone to answer and talk on the phone
That is a wonderful plus
When it is time to replace, and that day will come, I will replace them with more Skullcandy
I am constantly impressed with the quality of these earbuds
I generally would go through a pair of earbuds every 3 months or so but with skullcandy this is only my second pair in as many years
Not only are they durable, but they sound great, especially for the price
I picked up this pair with the mic but I haven't had an opportunity to use it yet
Very comfortable headphones, not my primary pair but may become
Love the non-tangling cord
The shipping was on time and the product was also properly packaged
These are not the absolute greatest earbuds period but they probably are for the price
Good construction and sound great-especially for the price
They fit fine in my earsThe sound is realy goodAnd the price was fineSo I recommend them
Awesome sound for $20
The only issue I had was that the pause/skip feature on the headset doesn't work with my Android phone (Motorola RAZR MAXX)
Still, you can't beat the audio quality for the price of these headphones
I haven't tried out the mic feature yet; the other problem with my phone makes me worry that the mic won't work either
If you have an Android phone save a few bucks and buy the version without the mic
But definitely buy these if you're in the market for a cheap pair of in-ear headphones
I've had these earbuds for about a month now and I am always impressed with them
I almost bought 200 dollar Beats By Dre earbuds which are very similar, but I searched a little more and came across these
They come with two sets of gel-like ear tips which are comfy and help block out sound well
I was, however, surprised to find only two, not three, or four
The cable is a very soft plastic wrapped material and is flat, so I can just throw it in my back and it will not tangle up and I can pull it right out and listen to my music
It comes with a mic
and buttons to control music
There are no volume controls which is inconvenient though
The earbuds themselves have a matte plastic finish and are attractive looking
Now to sound
These block out sound very well, so you don't have to blast the music to drown things out
But if you do turn the volume up, you will be surprised
These have amazing bass
Very sharp when needed and rich too
Great lows and highs
I have never had a problem with them at all
I would highly recommend these to anybody
The sound quality for these are good for their price
However, the earphones are uncomfortable and fall out very easily
The wrong movement and they'll jerk out or come undone
Like the title says, for the money, the sound quality seems in-line
But then the rectangular clicker on the left cord, (which I suppose is also a mic), is supposed to Pause/Play with one click, go to the next track via two clicks, and go to the previous track with 3 clicks
Well, this just isn't happening with me and my Samsung Galaxy Fascinate; this screen just lights up out of being black
Maybe I'm an idiot and am incapable of clicking the thing properly even though there is a clicking noise being emmited from the item when I click it
Maybe this feature isn't meant for MP3's on phones, but CD's, which would be ridiculous to create a mic for a CD player
Or just maybe it's the phone's fault and I need to go to Korea and let Samsung know about this, the food is pretty good over there
i like how long the cord is to be able to rout it through my shirt so i can listen to music while at work & when im on my on time
they sound great & phone calls are clear as well
skullcandy quality, i would  & have recommended these
They are amazing
I don't have much experience with other headphones but these are very good
I love the noise cancelling feature a lot
Just returned my Bose SIE2i's for these, woot
Bose were nice but I don't see much of a difference to be honest except for the bass on these on these are so much better
, which is the main reason why I returned the bose
They fit great and I don't mind chucking them across the room when I get home because they're pretty cheap
Man I have a lot left over on my gift card haha
Product was recieved on tie but broke days after
So if you want better quality then choose someone else
smh
These headphones sound great and I love the build in mic on the earbud cord
My gripe with this pair is that they constantly fall out when I'm running
I've even tried wrapping the cord around my ear so they will stay in and they still manage to fall out
So if anyone is thinking of getting these primarily for running, DO NOT buy them
If you're just going to use them to walk, or ride a bike then they will be a great pair for you
The sound is good on these, perhaps a little light on the lower end, but still good
My issue may be caused by my physiology, but these things don't stay in my ears
Even after putting on the smaller rubber fittings instead of the bigger ones that come on them, the phones never feel like they're really properly fitted in my ears, and fall out with the slightest turn of my head
I'm an average-size adult male -- maybe my ear canals are just small
If I really push them in, they stay, but the pressure will get uncomfortable after too long, and I can't imagine having speakers right against your eardrum is a good idea for anyone in the first place
I'm happier with the old-style iPhone (pre-iPhone 5) earphones that sat in the outer part of the ear
The iPhone headphones seem to have just slightly better sound, too
They're fine for sitting at my desk, but I'm never going to be able to use these running
They sound great but Ive had three pair and they ALL went bad out of one ear
The sound becoming staticy and then just cutting off all together
Two of the three the play pause button stopped working as well
I would NOT recommend these
I bought these earbuds to replace my broken Apple Ipod earbuds
The sound quality of the Skullcandy earbuds are good but the earbuds will not stay in my ears
If I move slightly, eat or anything, they immediately fall out of my ears
I have average size ears and even with the smaller earbud covers on, the earbuds won't stay put
I can't recommend these and will be purchasing new earbuds from Apple
i bought this headphones two years ago, the exact same model, and they were way better than this ones i bought now
makes you wonder what happened with the product 'cause the price hasn't gone down, that's for sure
Just a waste of money, the right side does not work just opened the BOX
Buy something earbud else but not skullkandy
Beware of the on-off switch on the wires
In theory, this seems like a good idea, but in reality, this extra switch means that my headphones are constantly turning my i-Pod on by themselves when the button happens to get jostled in my purse
It's a huge annoyance to hear it turn itself on or to realize that my iPod has been running all day and the battery is nearly dead
I hate this feature
I give this 5 stars because of how well the bass is compared to the aftermarket Apple earphones
I haven't had them for a while, so I can't say much about the durability, but I must say, this shipped fast
I ordered around midnight Tuesday, and I got it today Wednesday afternoon
My only issue is the mic feature as I don't use this with my phone, so it does get in the way, but they work great
If you have an issue with them falling out, try switching to the smaller earpiece
I did that and it resolved my issue with them falling out
Received them in the mail this week and immediately tried them out with my Samsung Galaxy S3
Phone was also being charged via USB from my laptop at the time, as it usually is during the workday
Pretty soon after putting them in the earbuds shocked me
Just a zap, but definitely an electrical spark on both ears
I took them out and put them against the back of my hand, and sure enough, it happened again
Never happens with my other earbuds
Returning immediately
Gave skullcandy a try, but this product is just flawed
I like the headphones
The wire doesnt tangle and they have really nice sound
Very satisfied
I would defenitely reccommend this product to others
I don't know how they get such great sound out of earbuds nowadays, but these rock
Deep bass
The non-tangle cord works good
I use my mostly for running/jogging and no problems with sweat failure as of yet
For the money you can't go wrong
Beware I thought I was getting the black on black (black logo) and I got the black with silver logo
Not a huge deal, but different than what is shown on Amazon
Seems good so far
The sound they produce is pretty amazing for the price
I thought I got a defective pair but soon realized you really have to push these deep into the port on the device you are using
If it doesn't go in deep you lose some of the sound
It had been awhile since I used headphones with this type of jack and forgot some of the rules of use
Like always go deep
Most likely the best earbuds in it's price range
Astounding quality
Yes better quality than regular Ink'ds
I'm extremely impressed
Good headphones themselves but product came to me damaged, the mic on headphones was cracked and broken, I was not happy
i really like them and because they are cheaper than radio shack its a PLUS
I REALLY RECOMMENT THEM FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIKE GOOD HEADPHONES
Instead of forking over another 120 dollars for a new pair of Bose in ear head phones i opted to go cheap and I am pleasantly surprised with these headphones
They function as advertised
the left side was broken the moment i got it out of the packagei would just get iluv headphone for less than half the price and better sound
I listen to a variety of music genres through these things, and I can safely say that the sound quality is great across the spectrum
Anything from the highs and mids from classical to the deep undulating bass from dub-step can be heard clearly
They might not hold in a battle against some $100+ buds, but for this price they are awesome
The left earbud went dead within a few months
This was a common complaint on other review sites, but I was in
Hurry and didn't want to drop a ton if money on earbuds
They got the job done, but there are much better brands out there
I have a cheaper pair that has stood up much longer
First off, let me say that for a fair priced pair of headphones these have pretty good sound quality and do a great job at blocking out background sound
The mic too is a great addition and has come in great use when skyping in busy places
However, the rubbery material that coats the wires grips to everything and i find wearing these headphones a constant battle against friction
Im constantly having to put them back in after they have been yanked out and really do consider this material to be a huge design flaw
You cannot run with them easily, sleep with them in and normal day to day tasks such as walking to work suffer from the same annoyance
i will not be buying another pair of these headphones
Skullcandy S2IKDY gives decent sound quality
The design is ok , fits into the ear properly
This is the first time use experience
more to follow
Very good sound, but I had problems with my Nokia 5230
When I listening music, it always start a voice call and interrupt the music
I had tested with my wife's samsung with android and it works perfect
I lost my original pair of headphones for my Galaxy S3 and had to buy a pair of these Skullcandy Ink'd headphones at an airport
Of course, the price at the airport is roughly double the price of Amazon, but that's besides the point
The shape and fit of the earbud was very good and the mic was decent
However, the sound quality is atrocious
There is so much static that softer sound were completely overpowered by hissing static
The earbuds were only ok for listening to very high volume music, or audiobooks where static was annoying but ignorable
For all other types of music, this set of headphones is worthless
Overall, it's significantly worse than the headphones bundled with most mp3/phones these days
Order this product on a whim, turned out to be well worth it
Very quality sound, especially for the price
Works exactly as it should and as advertised
Choice of different size ear pads is great
Have purchased three pair of these; one for each of my ZipClips and one for my daughter's iPod
I previously bought a more expensive earbud that had terrific sound but I want to use my earbuds when I workout and they were horrible for that
They wouldn't stay in place for very long and I was constantly pushing them back in
Seems like I spent more time messing with my earbuds and losing focus on my workout
Then I came across these less expensive buds that "looked" like they would be more stable during a workout
Well, I am way more happy with these than the more expensive unit I had bought
They have surprisingly great sound and stay in my ears rather firmly even when running
I admit that once in a great while one will start to pop out while running but that is the exception rather than the rule
If I have them in there properly from the start I can run all I want and they are fine
I guess the main point of my review is for those who are concerned about having a good earbud that will stand up to physical exercise such as in a gym or running outdoors without having to constantly push them back in
I am very pleased with the sound produced by these and would/will buy them again when these earbuds live out their life
And, they are cheap enough where I can get a good deal of use out of them and replace them easily when they give out, and we all know that earbuds will only last for so long
Highly recommend these
My daughter absolutely loves these headphones
She says that the clarity is great and is much better Han a lot of other brand earphones hat she as used
I was very impressed when I purchased these at the airport
I have smaller ears, and the smallest sized buds actually fit well
The cords are lightweight strips and don't get in my way
They aren't incredibly long, but they are a decent length to use
For this price range, the sound is good
Since I used them on an airplane, I know that they offer a small amount of noise cancellation, but they aren't perfect in that area
A good, low-cost solution
FYI, I paid less at the airport than is showing here, so do price around
Got this for my sons new itouch he wanted the mic upgrade but was disappointed when the volume control was not working
The sound quality is great and the ear buds seem to form a good seal and stay in place
I went for a run and tried them out
They kept popping out and the I can hear the cord bouncing through the ear bud
I tried messing around with them, but eventually gave up and continued the run without music
These will be kept at home for use, but I will not run with them again
A lot of people spectate that these earbuds are sub par by a wide margin, but that's because of what people are going by
Do they have good bass sound
Yes
I can hear bass clearly on a booming song like "Professional Griefers" by Deadmau5How long do they last
Seeing as I fall asleep with them on, go everywhere with them, and they clink around in my bag (not recommended even though I do it), they last about 9+ months
If you take excellent care of them, wrap them up nicely, don't bang them on things, and keep them in a headphones jacket/holder, -I give them two years max
My old old old first generation pair of these Ink'd buds lasted 3 years but I rarely used them
Comfortability
Highly
I couldn't stand Apple earbuds and these are just a gift from God
Price
20$ for these earbuds is not bad at all
They're good headphones and they last -it's worth it
So there is really nothing wrong with these earbuds unless you have a fussy person that doesn't take care of their stuff
I'd recommend these to everyone
They sound great, very good quality, but I have found that some people had some problems hearing me loud when using the mic on a call
My son really wanted these earbuds for Christmas and was so excited when he got them
He loves the mic
this was a very good purchase, the sound is nice and the sound cancel system works pretty nices, making every time I use them hear all my music without any distraction
These headphones are okay, but for the price, they do not live up to my expectations
I had a pair of Ear Pollution headphones that I bought at Walmart for $15, but the wire attached to the jack snapped
For the price, I thought that these would serve as a great replacement
They didn't
The lows, mids, and highs are great - less than perfect, though - but there is little-to-no bass out of the speaker; it's annoying to have to hear the beat instead of feel it
Coupled with the fact that these phones seem to amplify the vocals and drown out the instruments - quite effectively - it sounds like I'm hearing music through a tin can attached to a string
Overall, these didn't quite live up to the expectations I had set for them, and I was a bit disappointed afterwards
For a few dollars more (or less) you can get much better sounding headphones
The quality is good, however, the headphones stopped working suddenly after only 2-3 months of normal use
Would not recommend for anything long term
Hell, I love it
They work good,feel good, and are very durable
I absolutely recommend this item
Thank you again
Just to provide a simple background of who I am and what I have experience with to help you get a clearer picture of who is reviewing this product: I've purchased quite a few headphones/earbuds during my existence on this planet; from Sony to Sennheiser to Souls, from over the head cans to in ear buds
I have a home studio where I have a pair of ATHM-50's and Sennheiser HD 203's for recording and have a pair of Soul SL150's, SMS Street by 50's, Soul SL49's, and Sony XB500's for casual listening
SOUND: 3/5I purchased these Skullcandy's from Radioshack for $17
99 for the simple fact my earbuds I used with my work computer broke and just wanted a cheap replacement
After 2 weeks of burn in and listening, I will say that these earbuds are at most, average
The bass, although not overpowering, is very present and handled very well
The highs and the treble is where in my honest opinion, these earbuds fall short
These earbuds produce very HARSH highs to the point where I cannot listen to the song
Besides the harsh highs though, everything else is pretty good, especially for the price point
DESIGN: 4/5As far as I've tested, the microphone works very well and the headset is pretty clear when I'm on the phone
I really love the cord design (flat) and the earbuds themselves are plastic and are EXTREMELY light
I find a light weight ear bud to be very favorable, i
e
my Soul SL49 which I must say are the BEST sounding earbuds on the market right now, fall short in one area and that is the earbuds are so heavy, they tend to fall out quite frequently
I love the ability to pause and play music with the remote on the cord but it's missing a volume control
You can wear these for hours without any sort of nagging or pain-very comfortable
To summarize, I always HATED the Skullcandy brand and vowed to NEVER purchase any Skullcandy products but because of the reduced price point at the time, I gave in
Initially when looking at this brand, you can't take it seriously because of the name and logo (at least I couldn't) but I must say, coming from a negatively biased point of view towards this audio brand, they are pretty average earbuds and I would recommend this specific product to people looking for a cheap pair of earbuds with a mic for handsfree control on your iPhone or Droid device
A better alternative if you are looking for AMAZING sound are the Soul SL49 which I got for $35
Just look around
These headphones are good in the sound department but the mic answer/pause button feels poorly made
I would just get the skullcandy's with no mic
The sound quality is great, however I wish the mic was alittle smaller
Other than that I would reccomend them to others
These earbuds are decent if you're not an audiophile
I love how the cable is flat, therefore it tangles less
I would recommend these for anyone looking for a cheap pair of earbuds
Product came fast and looks great, can't wait for my son to open it at CHRISTmas
He will be so excited
They actually stay in my ears on long runs, Hope you all enjoy these as much as I have in the past weeks
I use these to talk on my phone and to listen to music
Great sound, very convenient
and at a great price
I had these pair or earphones since August, for $20, I must say these are the best earphones with a mic I have ever bought
I have a Nokia Lumia 900 Windows Phone( as you can tell by the title of the review), and I also have a pair of Philips SHE6000/28 In-Ear Surround Sound Headphones, the skullcandy earphones have a great balance of pitch, bass, and high vocals
The Philips earphones feel like they have a muffle sound when reaching high bass notes, but these have no muffle noise at all
The microphone is also another reason why I purchase these
Since I ride the bus on my commute to school and listen to music, these help me take calls while I'm on my daily commute
The call quality is outstanding plus the sound that it produces when making the calls are a 5/5
The media playback feature can be a little confusing at times
When the phone is on sleep, you can't control anything
But when its awake, it works flawlessly
So if you are in the market for a pair of in-ear earphones for you smartphone, I definitely recommend these
I was in love with these earbuds when I first got them
They fit in my ears properly, had good sound, didn't carry sounds over to whoever I was sitting next to, etc
I even liked the little mike on the side which has the nifty property of starting my music automatically when plugged into my phone
But
It all changed
The sound was still good, but the ear bud piece doesn't seem to be very well fixed onto the headphones
The squishy part fell off the right side
I replaced it with some replacement parts I had from another set that stopped working
Then, about a month or two later, the other earpiece fell off as well
Now, they're basically refurbished with pieces from different headsets, which affects how well they fit in my ears
If you don't really need the extra functions, I'd recommend getting a cheaper pair that will fall apart anyway
To be fair, though, the sound quality is still quite good and doesn't shock my ears, which is what happens with others, so
Good, but not great
These ear buds are some of the best i ever had
Super clear sound and really bumping bass
Sounds as good as my 1000w surround sound
They were great for the 3 months they lasted
One of the headphones cut out
If you go easy on headphones, these are good
If you are an active user don't get them unless you want to replace them frequently
I like these ear buds
They offer great sound with deep bass and clear highs
The mic feature works great with the iphone 5
The best feature is the flat cord
It's flat not round
This keeps the cord from getting kinked
They also shipped fast
A must buy
Like the fact that they are sturdy and the sound is excellent
Also they are very comfortable in the ear
I would buy another pair
My last pair of Ink'd earbuds lasted for years, but when they finally wore out, I couldn't find the color I wanted at the store
So I bought the equivalent pair of Sony earbuds
Big mistake: the Sony buds don't sound nearly as good
I ordered a new pair of Ink'd buds online, and sure enough, I could easily tell the difference when they arrived
Compared to the Sony buds, the Ink'd have much stronger bass and mid-tones
I find these to be very good compromise between price and sound quality
They're cheap enough to replace if they get lost or ruined, but they sound great with my Sansa Clip
I ordered the Ink'd buds without a microphone, but received the miked ones
No matter, they sound good, and now I know the left one from the right
The ear buds do not stay in my ears
I tried both pairs and neither one works
Never will buy again
I bought the headphones because the only other pair I had were crappy Apple headphones
They arrived on time and everything, were the color I wanted, etc
These are a great pair of all around headphones
The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because a couple weeks in they started making a scratchy, fuzzy sound while I was listening to music
Almost sent them back, but never got around to it
It's stopped for now, so hopefully it won't start up again
But yeah
if you ever owned a pair of skullcandy ear buds them look no further
If you haven't these are definitely worth the money
These headphones are cool the first day or two because the quality is decent
These headphones are almost like sound blocking ear plugs, and can be quite damaging to your ears
Once I started to workout in them that is when it all went downhill from there
From the simplest task to working or walking fast they ALWAYS fall out
They seem to not stay in your ears when you are in motion
Cheap headphones for twenty bucks
I could have got some better headphones from the dollar store
WTH
IT WAS COOL and fun day at the mall wit my  head fone but they toke long 2 get got to am flip
I ordered the Skullcandy Inc'd 2
0 Mic'd with Mic1 from BC Surf and Sport
I really need a mic to talk on the phone while I'm driving because I drive about 10 hours a week
They sent me the plane Ink'd, with no mic, which costs 5 bucks less
They even left the price tag on it: $19
99
I'm pissed
It took like 10 days to get to me, and I don't want to pay anything to ship them back, and wait another two weeks to get a 25 dollar item
Don't order from them, they are incompetent
I bought these last wednesday to replace the last skull candy headset
Then all of a sudden the right earbud went out
I will never again purchase this product again
I ordered the Skullcandy earbuds for my iPhone to use for listening to music and making phone calls
I used the product for two days and after ~2 hours of use the left earbud stopped working and the microphone button (to control the music player) also stopped working
The sound quality was just OK (tinny, etc)
They seemed like decent earbuds for the price but breaking in 2 days is pretty ridiculous
These ear-buds are great
I was going to get the JVC XX ones but decided to go with skullcandy since my last pair lasted me 3 years
I am not disapointed they sound great, with really deep bass and crystal clear mids
I bought these primarily for running
My requirements were for them to stay in my ears, and to have a way to pause/skip tracks
Sound quality was secondary for my purposes
That being said, these fit the bill quite nicely
They stay put in my ears, and I rarely have to adjust them
This, of course, will vary by ear type/size, but it does come with two different sized nubs
The Mic/control provides exactly what I needed--click once to pause, and twice to advance tracks
It can also trigger voice dial on my iPhone, which was a nice bonus
Sound quality is what you would expect in this price range--passable, but nothing to write home about
They seem to be holding up to my abuse, which is also nice for the price
I've run many miles, sweat all over every component, and everything still works fine
My only issue came not from the product itself, but the seller: I ordered black, but received red
The right ear bud is low as hell
They also don't fit in my ear
came in a monster beats by dre bag
only plus is they came on time and they look new
I also suspect them to be knock offs
Broken after using few months
Did not work when received
love my beats great sound but they would fall out my ear but i got the earplugs and all is great
These headphones are so cheap thye are a disgrace to the Beats name I could buy a better pair of headphones at the discount store for under $5
I was totally surprised at the poor quality of these headphones
I returned them the same day
they're an ok product
The sound is what you would expect, good bass responsible
The buds themselves are really attractive, visually they have a great aesthetic
However, having said that anything plastic feels
cheap
The plastic housing for the mic and audio controls is too large and close to the face
Personally, they cut some comers of you ask me
For a pair of headphones in this (price) category, they're a disappointment, but still somehow worth owning
I would personally go with a pair of Bose IE2's or Sure 215's, or a bit cheaper the Klipsch Image S4's, all better headphones from respected producers of audio gear
Needless to say, Beats haven't beat anything but their bottom line
Lol
If anything
Okay, mine broke pretty fast
Quality is horrible, it does not stay in ear, and broke within 2 weeks
My niece loves them
It doesn't fit my ears, always falles
Music not clearer as I expected
wonderful
I bought these headphones for my grand daughter for Christmas
She loved them until they stopped working a few month later, the company apologized and offered a replacement
The replacement worked for about five months and it too stopped working
I was willing to try a second replacement in May and now here it is Nov and the second replacement failed too
I was pleased with Amazon and a full refund but very disappointed in the product
These are awesome ear buds for non active use and I am not one for sales gimmicks, which most think of with beats, particularly now that a certain someone has bought them
I use these instead of traditional In-ear-monitors, given the response is nearly perfect from high to low frequencies
The ear bud material seems to be made of sound deadening material, which gives more sound immersion to the listener
They might not be the most durable (driver mounts which hold ear cone can break) but they are by far better sound performers than any other headphones in the same price range
I was a sony guy for a long time
but to get this level of audio response from sony, you would have to spend nearly 2-3x as much, not to mention big bulky ear buds when you get to multi drive high end versions
Go dre for pumping out one last good products before selling out
It was a gift and she loved them
I love it
Very amazing headphone
Don't tangle nearly at all
Easy to use and sound quality is great
I have these headphones for a month and for some reason one ear cuts in and out what should I do
I was disappointed with the base i thought i was gping to be blown away
And the cord is too short hence makes the ear buds to keep popping out
Was better off with the previous brand that i had
I don't really know as they are a Christmas present for my grandson
they suck, the sound is ok but they fall out of your ears and when you get them in your ears they have different sounds there for its awast of mony
Garbage
Right earbud stopped working after a year; always kept them in the bag, never abused them in anyway
I THOUGHT the sound quality was great, until I just bought the new SkullCandy Chops In-Ear
The SkullCandy are so much better; bass, highs, mid, and they F'n stay in my ears, all for half the price
Don't waste you're money on the urBeats
they're beat
Beats by Dre is now a fashion brand who happens to make headphones
Sad
These broke after a month
I could have bought 10 pairs of cheap headphones for the same price
Good
First off, there are many false reviews here, because people on the internet hate Beats
* Pros: They look cool, they seem durable, they sound good,they are loud, they are very comfortable, they have a lot of bass, and have great noise isolation
* Cons: Price is a bit high, ear buds rubbing together can result in goosebumpsThese earphones come with a very nice carrying pouch that fits perfectly in your pocket, and a few different sizes of ear tips so you are guaranteed to find a pair that fits perfectly for you
I've had them for a few months and I've had no problems at all, which is weird considering the fact that many people here are lying about them breaking after a few weeks
With these in my ear I can barely hear anything even without music playing, and with music you can't hear anything at all
Another great feature is how loud these are
I don't need to go any higher than 40% volume, and when I do there is barely any distortion
Conclusion: If you can afford it, buy it from here
If not, get a used or manufacturer refurbished pair, because these are awesome, and don't let the Beats haters tell you differently
Loved these until the sound went out in the right earbud
10 months of use, hubby just shredded last years Christmas receipts, so I'm screwed out of the warranty
First and last Beats purchase
So bummed, because I really liked these
Always took care of them
When not in use I've always carefully put away in the little storage bag that came with them
For this price, they should last much longer
The quality of sound is great
Great sound and actually fit my small ears comfortably
My purpose - I wear (wore) the urBeats to work every day but not for exercising
Sound quality - Great (though I'm no audiophile)Portability - GreatDurability - God awful
I received these earbuds as a gift less than a year ago and I'm already on my 2nd replacement pair
Price - a bit steep given the durability
Customer service - not great -> no easy way to process returns
You need to call them and deal with less-than-savvy customer service reps who will put you on hold every several times just to tell you that their only replacement inventory consists of pink earbuds and that you'll need to call them back again at another time
(WTF mate
)I really hope Apple works out the kinks here, otherwise I'm done with this company
On time
This is not worth it
I repeat, this product is NOT WORTH IT
This is the most expensive earphones, I've ever bought and it was such waste of a $100
They broke 13 months of use
Now, I spent a lot of money on this product so I wanted them to last
Thus, I never took them out of my house
I did not pull on the wires, twist them into a tight ball, or smash/drop them with force
I've used them only a handful of times
Furthermore, the warranty doesn't cover anything either
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
I think these were made perfectly to match Apple
Looks good on my gold iPhone 6
All gold everything Baby
Fit like normal earbuds and the in-line controls work with my iPhone all day
The material that the ear buds are made of keeps slipping out of my ear
I tried all the size options and none stayed in
The controller is too high in the wire and using it also pulled the buds out
Poor design
They work great
Pretty good for $100
00
perfect
Horrible
My daughter uses them all the time
I've had my Beats for 10 months now, and they are by far the best headphones I've ever owned
Keep in mind my only other decent earphones are the Klipsch s4i
The sound quality is, to my untrained ear, a smidge better with the Beats, but the kicker is their durability
I've used them during airline travel, and while they aren't isolation level quiet, they help mightily
I've used them to talk and drive, and no one has ever mentioned difficulty hearing me, nor I them
I don't use them for exercise, but I use them almost every day listening to audiobooks and music around the house
I can't count the number of times I've caught them on something and pulled them out of my ears, but no damage to the earphones whatsoever
I've even pulled my iPhone out of my pocket by catching the cord on something or other, but the earphones keep on performing
The 4S needed new glass however
I don't know what to say to those poor souls who've had poor quality Beats, but when I buy a new pair, I'll be buying some of these
Oh, and BTW, the "unboxing experience" is utterly ridiculous
It's frustration free and all, but guys come on I'm buying earphones not packaging
You could probably knock $10
00 off of the price by just doing some simple packing
It was the great product
Could not be happier
nice package and high quality headphones just like that headphones i saw in store
Bought these May 2014 and one of the ear buds has already went bad and it is only Octoberr 2014
Nice
good
Very disappointed
$100
00+ (shipping not included), is a lot to spend on a set of ear buds/in-ear headphones, especially when you're a single mother that scraped up and saved for months to be able to afford these for her child
Long story short, Christmas came and of course I felt like the best mom in the world, until not even a month later when one side stopped working
I called and emailed Beats numerous times just to be sent through hoop after hoop
Here it is now, almost 2 years later, and I still have the pretty little box with the BROKEN Beats headphones sitting inside, along with all of the fancy little papers and advertisements that came inside of the box
The problem with big name companies such as, Beats (and Apple), are that they spend majority of their time, efforts, and funds on stuff like packaging and advertising, instead of providing quality products and good customer service
(By the way, I only brought Apple into my review because on Beats website it now states that you are to contact Apple for any help and/or information on purchases, ordering, and sales
)
They feel good in the ear and I can wear for hours
That said, 3 pairs have broken on me and I am now getting the forth repaired by Apple
They are possibly the least durable headphones that have ever existed
It is insane
Things are so bad that Apple has the  repair box now on back order
greatest head phones if you want to be your kids hero
they are fantastic and the sound is amazing
I love this headphones man the bass awesome Thank you
The sound quality is ok, but none of the sizes seem to fit my ear
I tried my best to use all 4 sizes, but they keep sliding off
If I keep my head absolutely still they will stay on, but as soon as I look left or right, or as soon as I start chewing on something (moving my jaw) they pop out
I guess my skin is too slippery, or my ear is different somehow
:-P
I will stop supporting Beats they are the worst, I hate it so much
My friend gifted it to me as a birthday gift
Thanks to him
I'm sorry but Beats are the worst I will tell you why
The plastic so cheap and not a good plastic quality too
They need to work more with the cable
The sound not very bad but a lot of bass
I mean there is more than bass
What about a little clear sounds
I think it's better for Hip-Hop fans
If you are a pop or what ever don't buy it
I don't think they care about the sounds and quality of the headphones as they care about the money
I will wait for the new BOSE to change this bad headphones
No more for me BEATS
They sound fantastic and they even work with the kindle fire hd
I think these were made perfectly to match Apple

00+ (shipping not included), is a lot to spend on a set of ear buds/in-ear headphones, especially when you're a single mother that scraped up and saved for months to be able to afford these for her child
Long story short, Christmas came and of course I felt like the best mom in the world, until not even a month later when one side stopped working
I called and emailed Beats numerous times just to be sent through hoop after hoop
Here it is now, almost 2 years later, and I still have the pretty little box with the BROKEN Beats headphones sitting inside, along with all of the fancy little papers and advertisements that came inside of the box
The problem with big name companies such as, Beats (and Apple), are that they spend majority of their time, efforts, and funds on stuff like packaging and advertising, instead of providing quality products and good customer service
(By the way, I only brought Apple into my review because on Beats website it now states that you are to contact Apple for any help and/or information on purchases, ordering, and sales
)
They feel good in the ear and I can wear for hours
That said, 3 pairs have broken on me and I am now getting the forth repaired by Apple
They are possibly the least durable headphones that have ever existed
It is insane
Things are so bad that Apple has the  repair box now on back order
greatest head phones if you want to be your kids hero
they are fantastic and the sound is amazing
I love this headphones man the bass awesome Thank you
The sound quality is ok, but none of the sizes seem to fit my ear
I tried my best to use all 4 sizes, but they keep sliding off
If I keep my head absolutely still they will stay on, but as soon as I look left or right, or as soon as I start chewing on something (moving my jaw) they pop out
I guess my skin is too slippery, or my ear is different somehow
:-P
I will stop supporting Beats they are the worst, I hate it so much
My friend gifted it to me as a birthday gift
Thanks to him
I'm sorry but Beats are the worst I will tell you why
The plastic so cheap and not a good plastic quality too
They need to work more with the cable
The sound not very bad but a lot of bass
I mean there is more than bass
What about a little clear sounds
I think it's better for Hip-Hop fans
If you are a pop or what ever don't buy it
I don't think they care about the sounds and quality of the headphones as they care about the money
I will wait for the new BOSE to change this bad headphones
No more for me BEATS
They sound fantastic and they even work with the kindle fire hd
The right ear bud is low as hell
They also don't fit in my ear
came in a monster beats by dre bag
only plus is they came on time and they look new
I also suspect them to be knock offs
Broken after using few months
Did not work when received
love my beats great sound but they would fall out my ear but i got the earplugs and all is great
These headphones are so cheap thye are a disgrace to the Beats name I could buy a better pair of headphones at the discount store for under $5
I was totally surprised at the poor quality of these headphones
I returned them the same day
they're an ok product
The sound is what you would expect, good bass responsible
The buds themselves are really attractive, visually they have a great aesthetic
However, having said that anything plastic feels
cheap
The plastic housing for the mic and audio controls is too large and close to the face
Personally, they cut some comers of you ask me
For a pair of headphones in this (price) category, they're a disappointment, but still somehow worth owning
I would personally go with a pair of Bose IE2's or Sure 215's, or a bit cheaper the Klipsch Image S4's, all better headphones from respected producers of audio gear
Needless to say, Beats haven't beat anything but their bottom line
Lol
If anything
Okay, mine broke pretty fast
Quality is horrible, it does not stay in ear, and broke within 2 weeks
My niece loves them
It doesn't fit my ears, always falles
Music not clearer as I expected
The material that the ear buds are made of keeps slipping out of my ear
I tried all the size options and none stayed in
The controller is too high in the wire and using it also pulled the buds out
Poor design
They work great
Pretty good for $100
00
perfect
Horrible
My daughter uses them all the time
I've had my Beats for 10 months now, and they are by far the best headphones I've ever owned
Keep in mind my only other decent earphones are the Klipsch s4i
The sound quality is, to my untrained ear, a smidge better with the Beats, but the kicker is their durability
I've used them during airline travel, and while they aren't isolation level quiet, they help mightily
I've used them to talk and drive, and no one has ever mentioned difficulty hearing me, nor I them
I don't use them for exercise, but I use them almost every day listening to audiobooks and music around the house
I can't count the number of times I've caught them on something and pulled them out of my ears, but no damage to the earphones whatsoever
I've even pulled my iPhone out of my pocket by catching the cord on something or other, but the earphones keep on performing
The 4S needed new glass however
I don't know what to say to those poor souls who've had poor quality Beats, but when I buy a new pair, I'll be buying some of these
Oh, and BTW, the "unboxing experience" is utterly ridiculous
It's frustration free and all, but guys come on I'm buying earphones not packaging
You could probably knock $10
00 off of the price by just doing some simple packing
It was the great product
Could not be happier
nice package and high quality headphones just like that headphones i saw in store
Bought these May 2014 and one of the ear buds has already went bad and it is only Octoberr 2014
The right ear bud is low as hell
They also don't fit in my ear
came in a monster beats by dre bag
only plus is they came on time and they look new
I also suspect them to be knock offs

wonderful
I bought these headphones for my grand daughter for Christmas
She loved them until they stopped working a few month later, the company apologized and offered a replacement
The replacement worked for about five months and it too stopped working
I was willing to try a second replacement in May and now here it is Nov and the second replacement failed too
I was pleased with Amazon and a full refund but very disappointed in the product
These are awesome ear buds for non active use and I am not one for sales gimmicks, which most think of with beats, particularly now that a certain someone has bought them
I use these instead of traditional In-ear-monitors, given the response is nearly perfect from high to low frequencies
The ear bud material seems to be made of sound deadening material, which gives more sound immersion to the listener
They might not be the most durable (driver mounts which hold ear cone can break) but they are by far better sound performers than any other headphones in the same price range
I was a sony guy for a long time
but to get this level of audio response from sony, you would have to spend nearly 2-3x as much, not to mention big bulky ear buds when you get to multi drive high end versions
Go dre for pumping out one last good products before selling out
It was a gift and she loved them
I love it
Very amazing headphone
Don't tangle nearly at all
Easy to use and sound quality is great
I have these headphones for a month and for some reason one ear cuts in and out what should I do
I was disappointed with the base i thought i was gping to be blown away
And the cord is too short hence makes the ear buds to keep popping out
Was better off with the previous brand that i had
I don't really know as they are a Christmas present for my grandson
they suck, the sound is ok but they fall out of your ears and when you get them in your ears they have different sounds there for its awast of mony
Garbage
Right earbud stopped working after a year; always kept them in the bag, never abused them in anyway
I THOUGHT the sound quality was great, until I just bought the new SkullCandy Chops In-Ear
The SkullCandy are so much better; bass, highs, mid, and they F'n stay in my ears, all for half the price
Don't waste you're money on the urBeats
they're beat
Beats by Dre is now a fashion brand who happens to make headphones
Sad
These broke after a month
I could have bought 10 pairs of cheap headphones for the same price
Good
First off, there are many false reviews here, because people on the internet hate Beats
* Pros: They look cool, they seem durable, they sound good,they are loud, they are very comfortable, they have a lot of bass, and have great noise isolation
* Cons: Price is a bit high, ear buds rubbing together can result in goosebumpsThese earphones come with a very nice carrying pouch that fits perfectly in your pocket, and a few different sizes of ear tips so you are guaranteed to find a pair that fits perfectly for you
I've had them for a few months and I've had no problems at all, which is weird considering the fact that many people here are lying about them breaking after a few weeks
With these in my ear I can barely hear anything even without music playing, and with music you can't hear anything at all
Another great feature is how loud these are
I don't need to go any higher than 40% volume, and when I do there is barely any distortion
Conclusion: If you can afford it, buy it from here
If not, get a used or manufacturer refurbished pair, because these are awesome, and don't let the Beats haters tell you differently
Loved these until the sound went out in the right earbud
10 months of use, hubby just shredded last years Christmas receipts, so I'm screwed out of the warranty
First and last Beats purchase
So bummed, because I really liked these
Always took care of them
When not in use I've always carefully put away in the little storage bag that came with them
For this price, they should last much longer
The quality of sound is great
Great sound and actually fit my small ears comfortably
My purpose - I wear (wore) the urBeats to work every day but not for exercising
Sound quality - Great (though I'm no audiophile)Portability - GreatDurability - God awful
I received these earbuds as a gift less than a year ago and I'm already on my 2nd replacement pair
Price - a bit steep given the durability
Customer service - not great -> no easy way to process returns
You need to call them and deal with less-than-savvy customer service reps who will put you on hold every several times just to tell you that their only replacement inventory consists of pink earbuds and that you'll need to call them back again at another time
(WTF mate
)I really hope Apple works out the kinks here, otherwise I'm done with this company
On time
This is not worth it
I repeat, this product is NOT WORTH IT
This is the most expensive earphones, I've ever bought and it was such waste of a $100
They broke 13 months of use
Now, I spent a lot of money on this product so I wanted them to last
Thus, I never took them out of my house
I did not pull on the wires, twist them into a tight ball, or smash/drop them with force
I've used them only a handful of times
Furthermore, the warranty doesn't cover anything either
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
I had been eye balling these little puppies since early 2013 and thought they were a good choice
I didn't want to pay the asking price back then so I waited until I made a trip to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in Febraury 2014
I knew from past shopping trips where to go for the best merchandise and prices
Sure enough these Beats were available in a factory sealed box, all the included items and a warrenty card
It was the exact same packaging I had seen at Best Buy and Walmart
I payed only $6
00 and I do not regret it for a moment
These in ear headphones are great, not a single thing has gone wrong and the sound quality is perfect for all the types of music I listen to
I don't believe for a moment that these are cheap knockoffs, in Cambodia if you know where to go you get the real deal on products produced in China
Today I received the beats urBeats headphones and when I tested them the sound is good but the control talk doesn't work
I tested with htc one x but this don't detect the headphones, also with a Samsung
Best headphones ever
I would definitely recommend and they are pink too, which is my favorite color
I really love them
I specifically wanted the exact headphones as posted in the picture due to the cable type as its tangle free
The one I receieved is the older version, which the cable becomes tangled
I love them only they need some bud that can be change cause comes with only one but great item
the song is pure quality
I got these for my birthday 10 days later they went out this Is the worst thing I have ever spent my money on
They need to make a better product
Walmart brand head phones are better than these
Why because at least the last more than 10 days
Great
Got these for my son
Says "hands down" the sound quality rocks compared to lesser priced earbuds
He loves them
I am a 23+ year radio veteran--so I KNOW what good audio sounds like
There is NOTHING that will get me to believe the beats headphones are even remotely worth the outrageous price they cost
I've worn several and owned a pair, too
Were they good
Yes
b-u-u-u-t my Sony MDR 7506's sound BETTER and they are one-third the price
I've heard ALL the arguments, TRUST me
I'm not gonna change my mind
Period
However, I was mildly impressed with the urBeats earbuds by Dre
The sound really was pretty good
But let me also say this: I have a pair of Sony earbuds that I paid a whopping $20 on that I would say sounds 95% as good--and can out-do the beats in one very crucial area: they actually stay in my ear while exercising
I really would've kept them if they had managed to just stay put
I can't seem to figure out exactly why they kept coming out, either
Style wise they are remarkably similar in shape to the Sony's, but darned if they just didn't keep falling out and I found myself about ever half-mile being forced to reach up and push them back into place
Sorry, but that alone was a deal breaker
Now--I WILL say this: I won't suggest that all urBeats will act the same for each person
They may fit your ear like a glove and provide you with remarkably great sound for years
All I can say is if they cannot stay put, I've simply got to move on to something else
I was sufficiently impressed however that I just may take a gamble and buy a pair of their sport earbuds
if that means anything
This is our second set with the same issue
Not terribly impressed
They replaced it the first time, but I am not sure they will again
This is our second set with the same issue

There amazing
They have great base
The sound quality is not of the best
I would recommend them for everyone
The headphones I received were not as pictured
The headphones seen in the image are black with red detail, the ones I received are black with gray detail and a red cord
The buttons on them don't work either
Very disappointed
The pic is wrong; I received the older generation of the earbuds
Not sure if I should return
The earbuds work but just not the one shown
They broke within a month and for some reasons thew year warranty didn't work for me
customer service through this company sucks
As a dj, let me tell you, the quality is not that great even in sound
The worst money I've ever spent
Way too expensive for a cheap pair of headphones
I bought these ear buds to better hear the audiobooks I listen to while exercising at the gym
I still have to turn the volume up to the max to hear the book but when listening to music the ear buds are excellent
I probably need buds that offer noise cancellation but these will do for now
Very disappointed didn't even last me a week
I couldn't do any physical activities with them
The wire had to be in a specific position for them to work
While the quality of these headphones are good and seem to work fine after about an hour or so they are in fact a knock off they are shipped in a pouch not a box and they have an ibeats form factor with urbeats paint on the top and ships with a urbeats case the first picture is accurate of the product not the last five or so but i do repeat these ARE NOT GENUINE AS PROMISED
The buds have decent sound but the volume controller is cheap plastic and the cover has already broken off
Should have asked for a refund but didn't want to go through the hassle
Wonderful sound and the bass is awesome
I would tell others about this
i would refer a friend to you
I purchased these because I heard rave reviews about the sound quality
When compared to my cheap gym earbuds for $20 they sound almost exactly the same
I tested them next to each other, 6 times with 3 different songs
Same
If you are looking for loud sound quality these are not the ones
At most they offer a deeper base tone but thats not what I am looking for
I am returning,
I am now on my 2nd pair because the original pair quit working about 6 months after I purchased them
I was given a replacement pair from Beats and now that pair has done the same thing
Both sets have had the same issue
One of the earbuds no longer has sound coming out of it
I take good care of these and its not like I use them 24/7
I did not expect to have this much trouble out of these considering the price they charge
These are no different than the $20 ones at walmart or target
Bottom line, the quality of the headphones are great
Looks and sounds fantastic, but if your shopping around for headphones to use for active activities, like jogging, lifting etc
, i suggest getting something else
Here's the problem
They made these headphones very durable and heavy, so even with the lightest jog, you'll find yourself shoving the earpiece constantly back in your ear to have it not fall out
Annoying to say the least, but they sound great
Hope this post helped you out
They're pink what else could you ask for:)
I've been looking for these but didn't want to pay a high price
I love that they come with their own case and different sizes for your ears
I wear them more than I thought I would
Perfect for running they don't fall out
I got the blue pair, and these earbuds are just pretty
I've had a kinda bad experience with Beats products, due to questionable build quality and overpowering bass with their headphones
Being small earbuds, these do not suffer from that issue, because they are much more limited in the output they can exude
They are very durable for buds; most are built with cheap plastic, but these have some chrome with them
Bass is still quite prominent, but mids and highs are more noticeable
Vocal quality is decent, and that's why these don't get a 5
That and the price, because I cannot justify spending 100 bucks on buds
I only buy beats products on big discounts, which is what I did here
I bought them for my husband and he is very happy with them
We would purchase them again when needed
The sound is perfection compared to any other in ear headphones
I have bought several for family members as well
I gotta it today
Im from Chinese, so I wait for a long time
However,I like it
It beautiful
总的来说其实也是不错的产品。
I got these headphones for Christmas and used them occasionally for work but nothing that would cause it to stop working
After approximately 3 months the left headphone started skipping out and the controls stopped working too
3 days later the right headphone started doing the same
Definite wiring issues by the input jack
Don't waste your money
Buy the bose in-ear
The only reason I got beats was because I lost my bose and even then the beats were a gift
I would never spend my own money on this crap
And if you do decide to buy it, KEEP YOUR RECEIPT
Beats has a 1 year warranty on product deficiencies
I've had these headphones for about a week now and as far as I can tell they are great
I've seen a lot of negativity about these and that initially worried me
The packaging was really good and they came with a nice leather carrying case
Upon first use I was stunned by the clarity and deep bass I was getting
I took these out for a test run and went for a 2 mile jog
There was never any discomfort with these and they remained in my ears throughout the jog
I will come back and update in a few months to see if these are still holing up to how I expect them too
Tricky fitting as I happen to have dodgy ear canals but the bass response is awesome
The WOW factor wore off soon as I am pretty used to good headphone as an audiophile
I received my upbeats as a gift for christmas - I wasn't expecting much out of them, given Beats' reputation for having some pretty mediocre products, but boy do these hit the bass hard
Good, can-kicking bass is hard to achieve in any in-ear headphone, due to the fact there are no "cans," but I feel like Dre knocked these out of the park
Though definitely targeted at hip-hop in specific, these headphones actually have some nice musical range and like I said, the bass is pretty impressive
One of the few cons I have about these headphones, is the earbud cones
I feel like not a single one of the provided rubber ear cones fits perfectly
Close, but just off in some way (though I'm very satisfied there were options)
The packaging was sophisticated and phenomenal, and the carrying case is INCREDIBLY convenient - especially because I was used to coiling the apple EarPods before
Overall, great earphones, some pretty awesome sound quality (not so much for acoustic and classical though) and some killer street style
I would recommend to any avid music listener and anyone who wants a sturdy pair that is reliable and fairly priced
These urBeats in-ear Headphone are great
The sound is fantastic and it has just enough bass
I wouldrecommend these to anyone
Another thing is great about them they are tangle free,which really helps,when you have them in you pocket or purse
Thank you so much
I choose a 3 rating because the product did not last very long before it didn't work any longer (Purchased in Nov
for Christmas and by February they weren't working any longer
I had read other review prior to purchasing them which mentioned problems with duration of use, but it is what my grandson wanted more than anything else
With that said, I will say that amazonreplaced the non-functioning buds
Since it was a gift for my grandson, age 16, I do not know how the new ones are working out
I will assume no news is good news as 16 year old boys are not heavy on conversation with grandmas
I get it on december 6, 2013, but now it already broke
it just have a better voice quality but it's easy to have a problem
I have had to have beats/amazon replace these headphones 3 different times
One of the phones shorts out after about 3 months each time
The sound is great but it doesn't last
Luckily they've replaced them without much of a hassle but it's a pain to go through all this
I lightly used these for just 5 weeks (maybe 20 hours of listening total) and the right earbud is already dead
I've had $5 earbuds that lasted longer than this
What a joke
Never buying this brand again
Update: It turns out they make you pay for shipping when you return their defective product
Wow
I've only had these ear buds for 3 days so I don't know if they're durable but so far so good
The sound is incredible, much better than my cheapo $5 ear buds
There's a 3D quality to the sound and it is noticeably clearer and crisper in sound
I got these ear buds as a free gift from buying a smartphone but they have made a fan out of me (was skeptical before about high end sound stuff)
Try them and its hard to go back to regular ones
EDIT: after two months one of the speakers has died
Changing the rating from 5 stars to 1
I am so pleased to have gotten these,they are just the coolest
The  incredible sound quality and comfort of usage, worth the cost
Right headphone died right after the return period ended
It was great up until it broke, good sound, good at blocking out external noises
one ear bud went  out
no sound
Well i thought they would last longer
other then that your services were excellent
thank u
These arrived with a broken piece, we thought we'd fixed it
The broken piece seemed to remain broken--we were given a refund :-)My son used his b-day $ to buy these and was incredibly disappointed by the fact they were shipped this way
Wondering if these were previously owned
Sound quality is great (as expected), but for some reason the volume control doesn't work with my Samsung Galaxy S4
Love 'em
They 're the best headphones ever
Great color pink which is my favorite and designed by the Queen Nicki
Thank u
Beats are like heart beats
Without them, you cannot have a feeling of sound
Once again the perfect colour for my sweet sister
I gifted her and she liked it
I bought these guys over Christmas and I am an avid user/abuser of ear buds
I got tired of the hype and decided to invest a hundred bucks and see for myself what all the hooey was about
I'd read a couple of reviews that raised some quality concerns but overall approached the purchase positively
I promised myself I would wait a few months to review just to make sure I presented an educated opinion so…five months later, here goes
I live in the windy city and spend Goode deal of time commuting via public transportation plus I work out so my ears spend the majority of their time with buds plugged into them
I've spent the same amount of money as Urbeats on brands like Bose and Skull Candy and Sennheiser and my complaints are always the same,  first
the little rubber ear things are never securely fastened and always fall off forcing you to find replacements or to buy a new set
Secondly, the sound quality generally doesn’t rival over-the-ear headphones and thirdly, because mine take a lot of abuse, they have short lifespans
Well, I’m happy to report that I can't make one of these complaints about my Urbeats
The quality is very good
The flat rubber cord makes these feel like the Bentley of ear buds and the solid construction of the speakers are able to take a decent beating
Second, the sounds quality is, for an in-ear very very impressive with deep base resonance that at times requires me to turn it down via an equalizer setting
Finally and most important (for me), the rubber earpieces, while removable to clean, are so securely fastened to the speaker unit that its virtually impossible to lose them
These ear buds are AMAZING
Anyone who lives for a well-fitting quality ear bud should be forced to try these
Their price is high but completely worth it and they come packaged in such a way that they make an impressive gift as well
If, like me, you’ve been up and down the aisles of Best Buy looking at earbuds and have been, overall, disappointed in your purchases, I beg you to give these a whirl
They are worth it
These are awesome
Love the size, quality of construction, price and just overall very very happy
Buy these for sure
The box came allRipped and was afraid they were used
They were hard to stay in the ears at first
Then was able to get them to stay
Great Sound but unfortunately they short out just as easily as any cheap pair
For the price I hoped the technology would be better
Had nice sound and nice bass but the right earbud no sound within a month of purchase should have better durability for something you paid $100
what you pay in extra money is certainly worth it for the excellent quality of sound you get
I dread the idea of ever losing them
great product, fantastic packaging, slick design
however did not deliver
sadly disappointed - after one use the left ear piece died
sadly this product is not a monster beat
but rather a dead beat
Just to clarify, I bought these exact ones at my local target
Also, I am not an audiophile
These are amazing
They have very good clarity
The highs, lows, and mids were all very crisp and clean
The sound keeps the signature beats signature
If you do not like a LOT of bass, these might not be the ones for you
For me however, I enjoy the beats bass sound
The build quality is also very good
It is a matte aluminum with red accents(I have the black and red)
If you don't put them through vigorous conditions, they should be fine
The look is just sexy
I love the contrast between black and red, so these headphones looked really good to me
Overall, these are very good and sturdy
However is you dont like a lot of bass, you might want to look at some other earbuds
I love my new erbuds
each one fits so well in each ear and stays in place, so comfortable  pleased
Seller says product has never been worn, I don't know about that, but they have been opened
They are not sealed nor in original packaging
Doesn't come with the replacement earbuds, I had to buy them because the ones it comes with are too big and headphones kept falling off
Seller did answer my messages right away
do not buy these just because they say beats
they had okay sound quality the 3 months i had them till one side of the headphones broke
the tangle free cable isn't tangle free, the earbuds get screeched and they all around suck
I really like these earbuds, but they WON'T STAY in my ears
They have great sound quality, comparable to the Solo headphones; but they keep falling out of my ears, especially my left one
I thought it was just me that had this issue until I read other reviews
I'm torn, I love they sound if they could stay in my ears for more than five minutes
I LOVE THE SOUND, not the fit
The plastic sound control thing fell off after the first week
but the rest are fine
Sound quality is pretty good
These were bought as a christmas gift and were used for 1 month and broke right away and they won't even return them because you only have a month to return
DOn't buy unless you get a plan to protect them
MY SON LOVED THESE BUDS he almost nvere takes them off so I know this was ag reat purchase for him
After about a week remote control didn't work it
Make sure if you like this kind of headphones before you buy it
I mean the headphones are not confortamble in the ears, as good as from apple
I am a student and I love this earphone
It's light and it looks osm and I love the sound quality
I recommend this to everyone
P
S
the only bad part is that the metal part sometimes hits your ears, but all you got to do is adjust it
Got this for my 13 year old daughter's birthday
She is totally happy as it works great with her ipad which is also pink, and she is s big nicki minaj fan too
Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and the one stopped working after 2 months
Very disappointed
especially for the price I had to pay for these
I don't get any of the negative reviews
I don't see how you can get any better sound out of pair of in-ear headphones
My dad sent me a review from a 3rd party site that raved about the base and how no other in ear sounds like these
I hesitated when I saw some of the bad reviews here
Then, a friend wanted a pair to buy for a long flight back from states to the UK and LOVED them
He told me I had to buy one
Since I wanted a smaller pair for use as a phone call headset also (I also have a different brand over-ear headphone set), I just went ahead and bought them
My 14 year old loved them so much, she also bought a pair
I then had a friend buy them and she loves them
Four for four
Really good stuff
Very unhappy
My daughter got them for her birthday on 2/13
Shortly after one of the speakers stopped working
They cost eddy to much$$$ for this to happen
AMAZING SOUND
TRULY WORTH THE MONEY
i deff recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing set of earbuds that sound and look good
The bass on these headphones is absolutely amazing, but the distortion of the sound spectrum required to achieve it can easily ruin a song
With the MP3 player on shuffle, I am amazed by the earbuds for ten minutes, and then yanking them from my ears when another song is mutated beyond recognition by something missing in the mid - treble range (and I mean, these headphones can nearly remove an entire guitar riff from a song)
The bass is always flawless, so I hope they find a way to fix these things in a generation or two
Great product
Beats headphones beat out Bose
By far in design and durability and sound
Would buy again
Fast shipment and great product
UrBeats have a pretty long profile - enough that they constantly fall out of my ear canals due to nothing more than gravity
The sound they produce changes with each millimeter they're in your ear; if they're pushed in all the way you'll get super deep bass, but if they move out even slightly you'll end up with nothing but tinny highs
There doesn't seem to be any midrange
The volume/pause/track skip remote is located way up on the cord, so you can't actually see it
You'll be blindly reaching for it with your right hand along the left side of your neck
The pause/skip button is quite small and located between the + and - buttons, so it's easy to turn your volume up and down by mistake while trying to pause your music
It's flat-out impossible if you're wearing winter gloves; it's just too small
The rubberized tangle-free cord works well, but tends to bunch up on itself
Not having to unknot it every time I pull it from my pocket is definitely nice, though
At $100, they're insanely expensive for what you get
A pair of $20 Sony in-ear buds are more comfortable in the ear, have a remote at chest level (where you can actually see it), and sound pretty decent for the price
Granted, they're not going to have the super deep bass the urBeats produce, but if you're not a fan of having to push them deep into your ears constantly to get them to sound right, you might be better off saving your money
I bought this and when I got this it is quite good
However, after a short period of using this headphones in different PCs, I found the right part does not work
Probably, I will not trust the US made as before
Bought my urBeats @Target because my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Couldn't wait
read all the Good & Bad reviews
I must say that "the good outweighs the bad
" The sound is on point
the best  earbuds I bought by far
the Dr
Delivered and Target hit the bullseye with a two year warranty for just $7
00 extra
that left my mind at rest
I'm confident that I will be "A HAPPIER MUSIC LISTENER
" Without Static
"Music is the soul of the man
" Marvin Gaye
I order this for my son and so I haven't had any problems
Would recommend
The color is nice and the quality is the same as if you bought it off the real beats website
It's amazing, I don't believe it has a 3
5 Rating
These in-ear headphones are truly amazing, and I've been using them for  long time
The headphones sound awesome with the heavy bass
Perfect for listening to hip hop and also the vocals are nice and clear
Great sound
Need to experiment with the ear buds
I fall somewhere in between but I am very happy with the head phones
This item worked fine until about two weeks ago, when the first headphone went out
I usually just twisted the wire to make both work, then the other one went out
All around piece of s*** headphones, save yourself some money and forget buying these
Purchased for my teenager
He loves them uses all the time
Comes in very handy in every way
Comes with a bag too
1st pair arrived with a bump in the wire that turned into an exposed wire within two days of use
The replacement for those actually shocked my ears
It was the craziest sensation, luckily I was on my iPhone when it happened and I am sure that the voltage isn't too high
The first time I felt the shock I was a bit confused, and I think it might have knocked some common sense out of me because I left them on and it happened not once more but maybe 3 more times
Now I am returning them and no matter how great they sound I am sticking with my iPhone headphones
Two pairs with two separate issues in a week
not going for a third pair
I purchased these on a whim
Started using them and loved the sound but within two weeks, pulling them out of the case the wire pulls out of the mic/volume control button
I immediately contact customer service and they tell me they won't replace them due to the issue occurring from normal wear and tear
This is after I produced several photos of the earphones being in good condition except for the cord separation
I cannot believe my $100 headphones come with such poor quality and customer service
The sounds are great on this earpiece
I could literally feel the bass beating in my ear
The same music sounds flat on all the other earpieces that I have
Noise cancellation works well too
No regrets
I purchased these for my daughter and she is very happy, says the sound is excellent
I am glad I purchased these from amazon
They sound really great, especially with pop music
I love the color, too
They are the perfect pink - not too light and not too bright
And they are very comfortable
I have had beats before but unfortunantly my kids got ahold of them
The perform just as expected definantly worth it
I love them they sound great and there my favorite color
They make your music like its never sound before
Very nice quality sound and does a nice job reducing outside noise
It is also very durable so it should last the kid a lot longer then the cheap ones we have been buying
So expensive and I used it for 2 month and the left side doesn't work
I'll never buy it again
sorry beats
Have not seen these come out of my daughters ears since arrival which should say alot
They are very good quality and sound great too
I was so exited for this product thinking I wouldn't have to replace it for a long time
When it arrived I was pleased with the quality of sound, but then I realized that this was NOT COMPATIBLE with my Samsung S3 phone
Every time I had to answer a call I had to take the earphones out
Then less than 2 months later the right ear is out
This was certainly not worth the money, I've had cheaper headphones last me a whole year before breaking
Not happy at all with this product
what you pay in extra money is certainly worth it for the excellent quality of sound you get
I dread the idea of ever losing them
I purchased these on a whim
Started using them and loved the sound but within two weeks, pulling them out of the case the wire pulls out of the mic/volume control button
I immediately contact customer service and they tell me they won't replace them due to the issue occurring from normal wear and tear
This is after I produced several photos of the earphones being in good condition except for the cord separation
I cannot believe my $100 headphones come with such poor quality and customer service
The sound is awesome, the build quality is not
I have done a RMA and those broke even faster the the original pair
Only got about a month or two of use then the buds start cutting out
Stay away and get some other more durable earbuds
I am not even going to bother with another RMA, I am just throwing them in the trash
rip off shocks thru my ear and my warranty is over just started using them never again yous took my money these must be imitation
I was attracted by this color, and the discount
The earphone is perfect, the color is lovely pink, and the sound performance is perfect
These headphones were not properly reconditioned
Microphone never worked properly and speakers failed after 30 days
Bought them for son as a Christmas present, so warranty expired before the speakers failed
First and only time I have had a problem with reconditioned products so I assume that this company did not properly recondition and test this product before the sold them to me
I like the quality of the earphones but the remote came to me slightly damaged
I can only pause/play the song the other buttons don't work
But overall, great earphones
The in-line mic makes this a decent product for daily usage, Sound quality isn't up to par for the price
There is a good amount of bass as is consistent with the Beats brand, but this comes at the cost of having a somewhat undetailed and artificial sound
As an example of a direct comparison, I was listening to 'The Chain' by Fleetwood Mac off of an uncompressed WAV file from a laptop computer and decided to switch to my Ultimate Ears UE700 (now discontinued)
The drum solo lead-in to the song sounded flat and artificial on the Beats earphones while listening to the same track with the UE700 restored the life to the music
I found the difference to be quite clear even listening off of a laptop
I really wanted these so I used my $50 gift card towards these and got them for $39
95
I really don't think they're worth $99
00
I tried all the different earbuds but they still fall out if moving around
If you're planning on using them to run or workout the power beats are probably a better choice
The sound is ok and the mic is handy but too far up
Overall I like them because I mostly plan to use them when on the bus or train & the apple earbuds fall out too so maybe it's my ears
These are the BEST headphones ever and I mean it
Totaling worth the price
The are so clear and sound wonderful
These have amazing sound and bass and they are a great deal considering they are normally more expensive get these
this earpud is very good, im not experiencing any problems with it
this is the best earpud for daily use
Love these headphones
I had the iBeats before but I definitely like these ones better because of the tangle resistant cords
It is very stylish without compromising the sound quality
These headphones as I said before are amazing, definitely worth spending the extra money for them
the sound quality is unbelievable for earbuds
These earbuds are definitely worth the money
I was hesitant about buying them for Christmas, but after listening with them I would have to say they were worth the extra expense
Absolutely amazing sound
I love these headphones, they're exactly what I was expecting I wanted beats audio but I didn't want the ugly over the ear headphones
I wanted ones I could easily throw in my pocket and that sounded amazing
These are amazing and I love Nicki Minaj
I got them super cheap
I recommend them
These where purchased as a gift for my teenager and he says they're awesome and that the sound is great
For my first purchase I was really impressed
The shipping was fast and my item was in the orginal packaging which I really liked
Everything looked the way it was advertised and it turned out being a great present
I have been enjoying the headphones, however, the metal outers seems like a cutting into my ear
It just feels like it, nothing is cut on my ear but it is not the most comfortable set of earbuds because of this
The sound on them is amazing with great highs, mids and bass
Would be much better fit with an angle earbud or softer outer casing
The sound and clarity is excellent
In addition, they have a very stylish look without looking cheaply
It was a Christmas gift and tge recipient loves them
Brought for my daughter she love's them
They sound great
The price with delivery actually came out cheaper and I was surprised
Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves them
I haven't been able to use them yet so they must be good
I bought many earphones for my music but they always break, the music was low and ugly so I bought this and I'm a happy guy
I use them on my way to work and it just makes my day
love them
Bought these for my college aged daughter who loves them
She really likes the sound and felt it was significatly better than what she had (which were much cheaper)
Awesome design with even better sound
One of the best features of these earbuds is their noise cancelling ability which is rarely mentioned
Deep sounds and you look great
Way to go Dre
The sound quality is good but the wire is too heavy and the ear beats fall out of your ears
They may be good if you sit still on a plane or something but,they fall out when your walking
I tried all the different ear pieces and to no avail uughh
They buy these
This headset is worth the money, the quality of sound is remarkable and I would definitely purchase this product again
Purchased two sets of the urBeats because it seemed like such a steal
These were given as gifts, and both kids loved receiving these
They say the sound is excellent for an earbud
I bought these for my daughter and she was very happy with her gift
She loves the sound but says she has to get use to the fit in her ears
initially not that comfortable
However, she is very impressed with the sound
We bought for our daughter because she didn't want over the head ear phones and she loves them
They are cute and good quality
These never tangle and I love them
Great volume control and includes matching earbud covers as well as a carrying case
I will be purchasing a purple pair very soon
My granddaughter loves it
There is nothing to indicate that it's Nicki Minaj, except for the color pink, but she loves it anyway
Its great
just so beautiful :) I never had the head phones before
they come with extra ear pieces and u can wear them for ling hours and for jogging they really stay on
I have been through 3 of these
The toggle is not built well and after 4-5 months (on average as this is my third one) it stops allowing you to change songs and people I talk to say my voice fades and eventually they could not hear me
The sound is great when it did work, but definitely NOT worth the price and bad quality
With a solid brand name they don't have strong quality to back it up
These earphones are a little more expensive, but its worth it
The sound is so clear and they block out the outside noise
I love these and would recomend them
Bought as a Christmas gift for my younger sister, a connoisseur of all things Beats
These were the perfect addition to her collection
Great sound quality as to be expected with all Beats products
Fast shipping
I am speechless how amazing these are
Best earbuds I have
Amazing bass and sound quality
At LEAST 20 times better than my old ones
Blocks out 90% of outside sounds
I was so excited when I came home from shchi land saw a box on my porch
Best EVER
:) :)
# Amazing
I like them
They are better than the skull candy buds I currently own, however, I guess I was expecting an oh wow moment
Overall pretty good, but as an avid music lover I am saving for Bose buds
Provided everything that the description promised and the sound was absolutely incredible
Highly recommend for all ages
Especially liked the fit inside the ear
Great headphone, but worked for 2 month only
Now is all garbage
The left phone stopped work
Don't buy it
Great product
Sound quality can't be beat
Bought as gift but tried them out and own other beats headphones that perform the same
I did not know that Dre and Monster split
My old ones were Dre from Monster and I loved it
It was time to get new ones and picked these up
Sound quality was terrible
Bass was weak and highs weren't crisp
I found out that the companies has split
I returned the Beats to the store and decided to try Monster
The sound quality was like the old Beats and cheaper
I will never again pay for over priced garbage
Bad move Dre
My 26 year old loves these headphones
They have great sound quality and are concealable
My son was very happy with his gift
Sounds amazing, came just as promised, I have no arguments about these earphones
also came in packaging with everything
Pretty much brand new
My daughter has been wanting a pair of these for some time now, so I ordered her a pair for Christmas
She is very happy with this item
The price was very reasonable compared to other places
Beats ur Beats in ear headphones were purchased as a gift for college student
Must have been a great item because they were stolen 9 days after he got them
These come out my ears pretty frequently
I tired a ton of different combos of the inner ear piece and the fit still isn't great
Plus it gets visibillly dirty
For obvious reasons
My daughter loves them
it was a good Christmas present from dear ol dad to his baby girl
Oh yeah
This Christmas gift for my step-son, he loves
I know these Beats will have many hours of use & will be thoroughly enjoyed
Fits my needs
Great sound quality produced by the earphone
Easy to carry around
This is my first beats product and its purpose is very well achieved
i got these on sale, ~$70 so i figured i would go for it
ive had a pair of senheisers that i liked more, but i left those in a bar
love the tangle-free cord
also they come in colors now
Powerful, lightweight, compact, pleasing to the eye, and  with handy packaging to keep my earphones safe whilst I'm on the move
i was pretty scared buying a used product and for more then 50% off of stock price but i ended up getting them in four days and theyre legit and work fine :D
Yes these things are the best headphones, sound wise, that I have ever had
However, the fact that I have tried all the ear buds and these things pop out when I turn my head is HORRIBLE
As long as I stay still they stay in, but if you are active and wearing these, be prepared to continually push them in
They are supposed to have a tight fit
I read the owner's manual, I followed directions, I tried all the different sizes and they just won't stay in my ears
Maybe I have funny shaped ears, I don't know, but these things will NOT stay in my ear
I may have to end up getting the solo beats or something else that doesn't stick in my ear
So disappointed
These are great, the in-line volumn control is wonderful
I got these for a Christmas present, and they love them
such good sound
it felt like the music was deep inside my brain and  I was living in a concert and my entire life was a music video
oh my gosh I love them they are so fancy too
AHHH good quality music is SO worth the price
Sound is perfect espically the song another bites the dust
(By queen) Love the color it is perfect sound is off the chain
Pros: Perfect color, amazing sound for a pair of buds) strong and don't tangle
Con's: When you move the song moves slower and if you turn the jack it sounds werid ( with my phone wonder if its my phone
)With my phone they make a buzzing sound and when I move the song kind of slows down voice control doesn't work and all this sudden the song starts to play regular it kicks in gear and plays like it never happened but it did
Sounds really  great ( amazing )
so I use my phone volume and that works
But what is weird that never happens with my Nexus
Besides that these are a good pair of ear buds got these on black Friday for 90$ worth it even if you pay 100$
Really Good ear buds totally should get won't regert get these &enjoy a new way of listening
Works amazing with my Pandora account
This was a fast delivery
Good product
could be a little better fit for small-holed ears
Overall, pleased with the Beats earbuds
They are the best earphones that I have ever purchased
The quality of music that comes threw is excellent
Wonderful
Apparently its no coincidence that these earbuds stop working after just 3 months
Same thing happened to me
I sent them back under warranty
Now I will have to wait a month to get another pair-- which will probably stop working after another few months
Got this as a Christmas present and fell in love at first sight
Not only is this product beautiful but its very sturdy and durable
Not only does it look awesome but the sound quality is simply amazing, unlike anything I've ever used
I Highly recommend this
Bought myself a lil stocking stuffer forChristmas
LOVE THEM
WouldTrade them for anything
Now I have a 13 year old who thinks he needs them :)
I've been sceptical about the advertised sound of beats for a while but NEEDED a pair of ear-bud headphones since my 8 year old dell headphones (still going strong) has finally developed a kink in the wires and I love my music
I bought these and upon receiving them was impressed by the box the item came in
I turned off all signal processing and equalizers on my phone and upon firing them up to, I was impressed by the richness of the sound and the deep bass
Although the ear buds had good sound to begin with, after only a few days the left bud did not work, leaving only the right to produce sound
The return went very smooth, and I was refunded my money immediately upon receipt of the earbuds
I would not recommend this product, as I have ordered 3 pairs now, and all three have had a defective left ear but
Was worth considering purchase but maybe not $100 it is a good product and beats it self is the best brand of headphones you can get with out considering the price
People talk about how much these have but to me im not seeing it all but also everyone is different the only thing is that you have to be carful with these don't just rap around your phone and put them in your packet try to put them in a place where thy may have more room like a bag also the only other thing is that you have trouble keeping them in as I did but nothing to bad and also if they are to bass filled for you try swiching the ear tips the larger ones seem to give me more bass while the smaller lighter ones seem less bass filled all in all worth buying if you have to money and nothing eles is on your mind that you would like for purchase
I bought this as a gift
He said it was the best gift he received
I listened to these, and the sounds really is awesome
Very crisp and clear
If into headphones, these are top notch
My son received these for Christmas and loves them
I never see them without them
Product is well made and great quality
I heard instruments on songs I've been listening too for a while for the first time
The sound quality is excellent
The bass is deep and thumping
I recommend this product as a starter head set
Then one can go to the more expensive, over the ear headphones
I also love the red color
Beats makes you feel cool
If it wasn't for the warranty I wouldn't be using these anymore
First pair purchased December 2012
May 2013 they stopped working, it was something internal
Beats Customer Support replaced them
I had to pay shipping and waited almost 2 months for the replacement
Replacement Beats stopped working December 2013
Again, some wire issue inside the headphones, so they were replaced
This time for FREE shipping and expedited delivery back to me
Now I'm on the third pair
let's see how long these last
Yes sound is good and they look cool but there should be no issue with these headphones lasting longer than 6 months
I use them a few times a week, an hour at a time
My dollar store headphones have outlived 2 pairs of Beats and I use the dollar store brand more
Beats are a ooorly made product
Don't waste your money
Love them
Everyone in my family have a pair
Glad that I held out, I think I got the best
Would recommend
Love the headphones
Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves them
I haven't been able to use them yet so they must be good
These were a reasonable price and shipped super quickly
They have a warranty and have good sound quality if you know someone that does not want the larger headphones
These headphones are expensive, but really well loved
If you can afford them, the sound quality is great
l would recommend these
My daughter just brought it to me
The package is so well designed and nicely done
I tried immediately and fell in love with it
I have a BOSS QC15 but often need something lighter when I am on road
This will serve the purpose
Hope this will last for a while
This is the 2nd pair of Beats headphones I've bought like this, and the 3rd pair I've had that has busted
I'm not particularly tough on my headphones, but have now had 3 pair just stop working suddenly - without doing anything to them
There is a year warranty, but that only covers one replacement pair - which means after you pay for shipping and go through the hassle of getting a new pair, if that one breaks within the year purchase, then you're out of luck
After I bought my first pair, the replacement pair went out and I had to buy another one
I stupidly hoped this was a fluke - and since the sound is pretty good for earbud headphones, I bought another one
Now that the third pair has gone out, I'm going to stay away and would recommend anyone else do the same
For this price, these should be a lot sturdier - I carry mine in a hard case, am not rough with them at all - but these must be cheaply made
DON'T BUY
These earphones are a complete waste of money
I only had these earphones for less than 2 months and the left earbud has already gone out
The sound was pretty good at first but now they are crap
I feel like i have been ripped off buying these
Please save your money and buy a more reliable and cheaper pair of earphones
I love these
Great sound quality and the fact that it has a mic so I can talk on my phone with them is great
My 14 year old son purchased this product and within 3 month the left speaker stopped working, luckily we had the receipt and was able to exchange them for another pair
Another 3 months later the left speaker stopped working in the 2nd pair
The sound is great for the time that they work
Would definitely NOT recommend and would never let my son waste his money on these again
A nice package all in all, but the quality is terrible
And I'm not a critic either
When I listened to them the first time they worked fine
Then after that I get static, it connects/disconnects frequently, and the hands free device worked one time when i i answered my phone with them on
Item was as described
my daughter loves them thank you very much
item was brand new in box just as described
Perfect
The price was right
it's Beats so how can you go wrong
Kids love Beats
Purchased for my daughter who is very pleased
Awful
You are paying for a logo and that's it
I bout a pair in June and they stopped working in August
They were under warranty so they sent me another pair
Guess what
Those stopped working after about two months
I've contacted them to see how we can get that resolved - I'm hoping they just give me a refund instead of another lousy pair
I decided to spend a lot of money on a pair of headphones because I thought expensive=quality
I was tired of having earphones stop working after a year
But I owned two pairs of Beats by Dre earphones and neither of them made it past three months
I was the victim of some savvy marketing
I was excited for my pair of UrBeats by Dr
Dre to arrive
I worked hard for these and finally I could get my hands on them
I had ordered two just because I wanted 2 pairs of good earbuds for my birthday
When they arrived I noticed the amazing packaging
The UrBeats came in better packaging than most headphones come in
The UrBeats came with the manual and warranty (warranty is s***)
The UrBeats came with the earbuds, extra different size ear tips, and came with a carrying pouch
I was floored by the improvement of these earbuds over my earpods
I could hear better sound and they had better bass
The sound was superb for about  2 months
I would take these to school and I would use these half the time at my house
They were my favorite pair until they blew out on 1 ear
My black UrBeats were the first to go
The earbuds blew out on one side and later both sides didn't work
Then later when I was walking home I noticed that my white UrBeats weren't working from one ear either
This caused me to be mad at the company
Then I remembered about the warranty
The warranty was going to save me
I was wrong
The warranty is just a word to Beats support
I shipped the beats to the beats store ,and then they sent me them back because I showed no proof of purchase
I contacted them and told them what happened
They told me to show proof of purchase then they would repair them
Ok I thought as I was printing out my invoice from amazon
I packaged both beats in 1 package and hoped they would repair them
Nope they sent me them back and not even a reason why
I was mad and decided these were not worth it
If you can stay away from these earbuds
As you may notice like I do now look at the 1 star reviews
Look at the pattern
These earbuds keep blowing out after 2-3 months of small usage
If you are willing to spend $100+ plus on earbuds I would recommend some headphones or get some better earbuds
Headphones in the $50 range could have better sound
Believe me these earbuds don't last
I had 2 earbuds blow out around the same time to prove it plus the other people that had the same problem as me
Very high quality sound for ear buds
I highly recommend them
Amazing bass without highs and miss being drowned out
The blue is a little darker than I was hoping for
but otherwise, they're great
The cord gets a little more tangled than I would have thought, given it's new flatness, but still better than the round headphone cables
These headphones aren't sturdy
I have returned these headphones at least 3 times this past year due to loss of volume
The earphones themselves, are great
but i don't know why the volume buttons only work on iphones
You would think since they are partnered with HTC, they would make the volume buttons compatible with the HTC one
But i digress
I ordered this pair of "urBeats In-Ear Headphones (Black)" with FLAT CABLE and red “b” logo on the earbuds sold by Kupoke, but what I got is a much cheaper model for HTC with ROUND CABLE and black “b” logo on earbuds
The Amazon customer service people was being helpful by sending me a return label, but I am abroad and Amazon is not responsible for the charges I need to pay to have it shipped back to the States, and it’s not worthwhile to pay the shipping myself and claim the refund
OK, I will swallow the loss and let it off this time
But I will NEVER EVER trust KUPOKE again
The dealer is simply OUTRAGEOUS
Not even the same thing
instead of the picture they sent me a pair of beats which comes with HTC cellphone
no box, no intruction, no warranty, no nothing
this is a totally ripoff, if you wanna get the real thing, get it from somewhere else
This is just RIDICULOUS
Beats Electronics includes four different-sized silicone speaker sleeves
Next, a 3
94-foot cable has a flat shape to effectively resist tangles
If you ever use in-ears while jogging, you'll love this tangle-free design
The cable also houses a handy mic and remote, and even a shirt clip
No need to reach for your device in order to skip a tune, take a call, or crank the volume—and iPhone users can even hold the main button down to activate voice commands
Unfortunately, the mic is so high up on the cable that you really can't see it at all—a minor gripe
More important is the fact that the connections aren't the most protected, so handle the cable with care
Lastly, users will also find a small carry case for the Urbeats for on-the-go protection
And speaking of on-the-go, these headphones block a considerable amount of unwanted, outside noise
High-pitched bothers like birds and neighboring conversations are 1/32 as loud
Even lower frequency sounds like dump trucks and trains can be reduced to anywhere from 1/2 to 1/4 of their original loudness
If you want the world to go away, these Urbeats can help
Bass bumpersWhen I unwrapped the Urbeats and found myself confronted with the image of an unclad lady in not but a set of headphones, I felt less than optimistic
Yet this set of in-ears entered the audio lab and emerged mostly unscathed, with favorable results across the board
it is pretty good headphone but the adjust button for volume is not useful and the quality of headphone is testing
It is fake because the part of the ear fell apart and I can't
Try to get it back on
I liked this product but when I received it , something was missing so I returned it
Hope I ll receive my money back soon
Great ear buds
I can no longer hear her music when she has them in
Just what my daughter wanted, and were delivered as promised
Absolutely perfect sound quality
Excellent value and durability
I use mine daily and on long road trips on the motorcycle
Purchased a set 8 months ago, developed a short circuit on the right side
Contacted customer support,shipped them to RMA on Sept 27, 2013 received a new set on October 2, 2013
I'm very satisfied with the product and warranty
I was in the market for some good quality earphones for the gym but not wanting to spend a lot of money considering there for the gym
These were a perfect buy for me, not only were they they in my price range but the sound and quality of these are amazing
I have now had these for 3 months and no complains, I use them all the time in the gym and I workout five times a week
The sound on the urBeats is incredible
The bass is extreme of course, and the clarity is good, but not great
They also have a superb design, looking really stylish and being very comfy as I can wear them for hours
They also have amazing noise cancellation
When I wear them on the loud city bus, I literally can't hear a damn thing other than my music
They have a remote and mic so you can control the music and make phone calls
The ONLY thing I criticize about these is they're extremely fragile and not as durable as they should be
I've owned 3 pairs of urBeats and none of them lasted even 3 months
They're amazing as hell, but definitely don't last long enough for 100 dollars
Perfect sound, but too fragile
Cons: Excellent sound with hard bass and a great designBad: Short lifespan, clarity could be betterEven with the most care, these probably wouldn't last more than three months
I'm on my fourth pair now, and this WILL be my last
And the sound is annoyingly flat
Good sound, but overall they're still not worth the price
These headphones are extremely FRAGILE
I would ONLY BUY THESE WITH A PROTECTION PLAN
My first pair of in-Ear Beats were given to me as a birthday present 3 years ago
I used the brand new earbuds for 3 weeks before they wore out
They lose connection between the male piece of the headphone jack and the wire
Just last week I got this "new and improved" pair as a birthday gift
Again, they failed in the same place
I have had these headphones for 6 days and already I can hear static when the cable is not straight
I treated these headphones with great care
I always rolled them up and put them in their holder when they weren't in use
They never were hit, dropped, chewed on, spilt on, etc
I had read many reviews and none of them made clear how poorly made these headphones are
They sound fair for the price and look sexy as sin but WILL BREAK
My friend heard me talking about my issues with these headphones and informed me that he continually experiences the same problem with his headphones but because he has a protection plan he simply brings them to BestBuy and they replace them
BRITTLE, DELICATE, WEAK, CHEAPLY MADE, MARKETED WELL
i bought these on june 28 and they broke sept 17
and nothing can be done to replace the buds
I was very careful when I used my headphones
very sad that I spent 100
00 for something that doesn't last a year
I bought these headphones used but very good was the quality
They lasted me *3Months* only and the right ear side died
I contacted the seller and wasn't compensated at all
The excuse was that there's only a thirty day warranty that I never recieved
You can get a pair new from walmart for 30$ more and a 2 year warranty
Don't be cheap and get these *Buy New*
You'll thank me later
I have been searching for great earphones for ages
Tried almost every there is
My budget was about $150 so I had quite a range to choose from
Even tries the Bose ones, since I am a big fan of my Bose sound system
I wanted a small
Easy to carry
Good base
Clear vocals
Good value for turn money
Pref the non tangle cable
iPhone controller and mic
But I wanted NON IN EAR
So I couldn't get anything nice
Was frustrated
Non in ear cause a few years ago had real bad exp
but finally had to give in
I bought the Bose MIE2i
I didn't like them cause they seemed huge
It was comfortable
The cable seemed frail
But omg terrible sound
Acoustics were good
But NO BASE
NADA
I knew I'd have to expect less
But NO BASE, I can't deal with that for a $150 earphone
I bought these
Amazing
Totally satisfied
Does all of above
Super clear vocals
INSANE Bass
Some issues as listed below
But that no prob with in ear I just don't push it totally in my ear
Just leave it very lightly
But it doesn't fall off
Seals off great
And no issues of vacuum generation or ear canal irritation
Cons
Mids are lacking
Marginally amped up treble
But I have still given it full stars causs hey I can't compare to to the sound coming out of my Bose home theater
That would be unfair cause of the price difference
I was surprised that the base DOES NOT over power the vocals
That's usually the case with cheaper or bass intensive brands
I am very particular about sound but not there yet where I can spend like an audiophile
So love them
Seriously had ignored beats range as a gimmick
But oh I was so wrong
I bought a pair of these about just under a year ago from hmv, i had them insured, the pair i have now, is actually my 5th pair due to them always breaking, usually just the sound in one ear being drastically louder than the other, the sound quality is amazing, i definitely don't look forward to finding a pair of equal quality, but ear phones should be built to last more than a year at least, it's even advertised that these beats are "built to last" however i am not the best when it comes to looking after anything in general, so i can't really say they're that bad, i could've taken more care with them, i would say, if you like good quality, and can look after them, they're a great choice got mine in near January and they're best thing i've bought this year
Very good time shopping experience
Headset is very good, sound quality is very good, very convenient to use the phone
I use these head phone with my smart phone and their really good to listen to music
I have an expense pair of over the ear beats but I can't use them all the time
Greatstuff
My grandson thinks they're great
These were replacements for a pair of urBeats that came apart and we didn't know how to get them repaired
Bass makes long listening sessions difficult
May be more to the liking of younger listeners
Doesn't fit my music choice
They came fast perfect condition
Bought for a gift and my wife loves them they sound great  she's happy so am I
I've had this headphones for almost 6 months, the metallic paint came off in spots around the headphones
The sound quality is good and it supports a high volume without compromising the sound, the bass is very good but the mid and lower ends can be improved
I had trouble with the left ear bud since it didn't stay in place
The major downfall is the plug, since is so stiff compared to the cable, after using it for 6 months I accidentally fatigued the internal cables so much that the connection with the left speaker was cut, I should have protected it better but I didn't expected this problem
The urBeats In-Ear Headphone [White] where ordered NEW through Amazon
com LLC
Given to me for my birthday on the 11th of September
Today it is the 10/26/2013 and they have stopped working
I am soooooo disappointed in this product
I have been HAD
PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS DEALER
YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE DEVIL
If the seller is reading this review I would more then happy to be given my full refund and I will then take down this review
Thankyou
These are, without contest, the worst pair of earbuds I have ever owned
I, by default, don't like Beats
Never liked the design, never liked the marketing
But I figured, eh, I'll try these little earbuds
Dropped a hundred bucks on 'em, and was actually kind of excited when they came in the mail
I put them in and walked around listening to music
Total number of times readjusting the earbuds while moving for 5 minutes: 34Total number of times readjusting the earbuds while standing still for 1 minute: 9The sound is not even close to remarkable
I'm something of an audiophile (Audioengine/Sennheiser/Yamaha owner), but second to sound comes the comfort
Urbeats failed at both of these things, more than anything has ever failed in the history of ever
Beats would be wise in putting these back on the market for $2
That is how much I'd pay for these earbuds
Two
Dollars
THEY SUCK
Period
If you can: GET THESE AT BEST BUY AND GET THE STORE'S TWO YEAR WARRANTY (usually $20)
January 2013 - PurchasedApril 2013 - Left earbud out
used warranty and got a new pair on the spot in store
June 2013 - Left earbud out again
used warranty to get a new pair
July 2013 - today
EXACTLY ONE MONTH LATER LEFT EARBUD is out
I decided to look up reviews on these headphones because this is insane
turns out this is a common problem
Taking them to best buy today
Really glad I got that warranty
Will never buy Monster products again
Excellent Sound
Nice Feel and Appearance
Crisp and Clear Sound
Nice Bass
Would hate for something to happen to them
Great sound, easy to use and seem very durable compared to most ear buds on the market
Not fond of the color I bought, but they work great
Its my hobby to try out different headphones and test them out
Mostly i just return them all but its all part of my search for the perfect headphones
Ive always read bad things about these and the reviews are right
These are without a doubt the worst sounding headphones i have ever tested
yes there is a tonnnnnn of bass but its not good bass
its muddy as hell and the clarity of the mids and highs is nearly non existent
DO NOT BUY THESE
i have also tried the monster branded N-Ergy ear buds
and they are a thousand times better than these for half the price
I think they go for 60 bucks at walmart
Obviously these URBEATS are just a fashion statement
and i have to admit that they look really cool, but thats the only good thing i can say
If you are dead set on monster brand go with the N-Ergy
They aren't endorsed by dr dre but trust me you get so much better sound quality
I am a music producer so i could go on and on about what is lacking in these beats by dre headphones but its not worth it
Just trust me and don't buy them
Cheers
I had Shure E2c which finally broke
For reasons beyond the scope of this review had to urgently buy earphones and in the nearest store: Walmart had these
Usage : 7 days
Construction quality: Very solid
Packaging: Very good
Sound quality: As with any +$50 earphones, I ignored day-0 sound and used my music device at high for 24 hrs at almost full volume with these earphones plugged in, to complete the break-in
I have a special sound track which I feel very appropriate for break in of earphones/speakers
From the 3rd
to 7th
day I listened daily avg 3 hrs
The bass is extremely heavy muting considerably almost 50% of all other music
Tonality of voice, small nuances like clicks of tongue, a sharp intake of breath by singer - totally absent
Mid-levels are non existent
Treble is there but overshadowed by horribly enhanced bass
My music device is in flat equalizer settings with no bass/dolby enhancements
The sound is neither bright nor warm
It's flat with the clear feeling that its suffering from undue modulation of bass
Strain to hear after sometime
Sound isolation is good, but nothing comparable to Shure E2c/E3c
Effectively, this product is exactly same as any other off-the-shelf $15 products available everywhere
At this price point, I would seriously consider instead Shure 215 or Eytomics products
I do not recommend buying it
Overall, these headphones are reasonably well-balanced although they have a bit too much upper bass that makes them less neutral
However, mileage (bass) will vary according how well they  fit your ears and provide a tight seal
As a long time fan of Dr
Dre's Beats collection by Monster, I never thought I would ever expect to experience any flaws or other issues with any of the headphones I've owned from Beats But UrBeats by Dr
Dre had to be one of the overall In-Ear headphones available from the collection to have encountered issues with
Now I don't know how bad the other In-Ear ones since I've never owned a pair of them but I heard they were dreadful and that UrBeats were actually way better than the others in comparison
So I bought a white pair of UrBeats in January and I was impressed by them at first and I loved them
I loved the bass it gave, the unique design, the power it gave to cancel noise, the rich sound it gave, and the compatibility with the HTC One X's Beats Studio
However, my amusment and enjoyment of my Beats ended after approxiamtely after 2 months of use when the remote began to fail (what a great suprise from a $100 pair of headphones, right
) and it doesn't end there either because after a week or so the left speaker blew
Now to spend $100 like that on headphones, you would expect for them to be worth it but in reality, UrBeats are cheaply made headphones who embarrassingly lose to other competitors who's headphones cost way less
I returned them to the store where I purchased them and they were happy enough to replace me with a second pair, I was happy to give them a second chance
The second pair lasted me 3 months, which was a new record, and I then thought that they maybe will actually last as long as my Beats Solo HD, which I've owned for 3 years, but that thought came to a short end when the right side of the headphone became quieter than the left side
This was the last straw for them, I'm not bothering to get them replaced but instead I'm going to try the Bose MIED2I as I hope that they will be better
If you plan to buy these heaphones, please buy them here for a cheaper price than paying $100 because honestly, they aren't worth it
Just because they have the Beats brand doesn't automatically mean they are great headphones, remember at the end of the day you are just paying for the name
There are Sony headphones cheaper than these that sound just as great as UrBeats
Be wise with your money and choices
To conclude, I was not impressed by the durability of my UrBeats and I'm upset that I have to leave them for the MIED2I but it wasn't their fault that Monster constructed them cheaply with a delicate jack just to rip off people for their brand's name
I hope they make the future models with improved durability and pricier construction that actually makes them worth $100
I usually don't write reviews but I'll make an exception
Ive had to have these headphones repaired twice and Ive had them since January
Every 2-3 months either one or both of the earbuds gives out and it appears to be an issue with the headphone jack
I baby these headphones and yet they always stop working in the same time range
Don't get me wrong Beats customer service is great and they are more than willing to set up a repair but the whole process takes 3-4 weeks and I have to pay for shipping even though its a manufacturer defect
I love the sound quality and they are great when they work, but I would not recommend this product because they constantly break
Buyer Beware
My girlfriend bought me these earbuds for our anniversary
They were great
for two months until they completely stopped working
First it was the control on the wire that stopped working and then the earbuds altogether stopped producing sound
They are NOT worth the money
You are paying for the brand, not the quality
When my girlfriend returned them, the workers told her that Beats break all the time
For the love of god don't waste your money on this piece of crap
Sounded great for 2 months then the left earbud shorted out
I'm a 55 plus year old female and did not use these as a young person would
Learned my lesson
will shop in a store from now on
Don't listen to the people who keep saying that the earphones don't work well
Quality is amazing, looks amazing and simply BEAUTIFUL*UPDATE*Since September 2013 I have been using these earphones
They still sound great, no wear and tear and none of the paint has gone
I am lucky to have a pear that work as a lot of people don't
February 2014
Loved the soundMy favorite ONLY earphones I would use2 months later customers cannot make out what I'm saying on the Mic2 days after that the cord fraysI have $19 headphones that are more resilient
Its a really nice box with little pouches, but for my birthday I got a pair of urBeats and a pair of Skullcandy Inks
They looked and sounded exactly the same, minus the fancy packaging
Complete waste of money
The price you pay for this product is not worth what you receive in return from these headphones
The warranty does not cover anything that basically happens with these headphones
You are screwed once these headphones break
I brought my headphones in late April by August the headphones completely stopped working
No sound in the right ear bud
Then no sound in the left ear bud
The warranty does not cover a blown speaker in the ear bud
You are basically paying for the name that is on the headphones
Sound is good but quality and warranty is absurd
i got the headphones on june 28 and now on august 24 the left side headphone just stopped working
first and last time buy a dre beats product
do yourself a favor and buy something else
Pros:Great sound qualityDon't tangle easilyCons:Scratch up very easilyBreak easilyLose small parts easilyBud casing way to rugged for wire which stresses the wire out until the wire gives out
urBeats In-Ear Headphones (Black)With all the "Beats Hype" I thought I would take the plunge and give these ear-buds a chance
I use ear-buds a great deal as my job involves flying coast-to coast 3-4 times a month
To be fair, I am also a hard-core audiophile and know great sound when I hear it
In the past I have used Shure, Nuforce NE-700X, and Sony earbuds with various degrees of satisfaction
These urBeats earbuds are easily at the BOTTOM of the pack
Fundamentally, these ear-buds are what I feared, heavy bass emphasis, mediocre midrange, and muffled, muddy highs
Shocking to me at this price point
Bottom line, it is what it looks like, if you are a serious listener, pass this one by
They have a size that is so comfortable that I can sleep in them
The sound quality is great and they are small enough
Soooo I got the nicki minaj version of these headphones they're super cute and very girly
I use to own the heartbeats by lady gaga, those were my first beats product and those compared to these are so much better and very well improved
They're light, they stay in your ear, & sound is impeccable
A lot of people say that they stopped working after a few weeks
I just got em today so if whenever they go out I'll definitely delete this review and write another one LOL
The only thing I thought a little negative towards was that the cable looking a little china cheap, BUT then again the nicki version is barbie pink so of course they may look a little cheapy
All in all I definitely recommend this product
They last a couple of month not long then right side goes out the you will have to fix the audio jack
Beats Urbeats are probably some of the best in-ear earbuds on the market
They look great, they're Beats (hey, like Apple, Beats is a brand that is instantly recognizable) & for their size (& the price range) they really are topnotch
For the first time with earbuds I've been able to hear the low end bass that was much lacking from many other earbuds I've owned
Sure, they don't stand up to the power of the Beats Studios I have, but they're terrific for people on-the-go because, let's face it, despite how sexy Studios are sometimes going on a walk or run with them isn't necessarily the best option
Overall, Urbeats are worth the high $99 price tag for earbuds & I recommend them
First I want to say, these ear buds are AMAZING
I've had them for around 4 months now and have had absolutely no troubles with them
Also, the durability
its crazy
Earlier, I smacked them on them on my counter to show off
But the main point of interest would be the sound quality
So, I have owned many sets of ear buds and nothing has come close to these
Both the clarity and the bass are amazing
I actually haven't turned them up anymore than 17/30 on my HTC Windows Phone 8x
So they are plenty loud
Pros: Amazing sound, good durability, has the controls on the cord, compatible with many devices as far as the control buttons go, and are overall worth the price
Cons: Of course, they're ear buds, so they don't fit all ear sizes, but my ears are pretty large and I hardly have trouble, plus they come with three sized of buds, so there shouldn't be much trouble there
Overall these are great ear buds and I would recommend them to anybody looking for a good set of ear buds
Definitely worth $100
I've always loved beats, and I got these to replace my old pair when they broke after 2 years
Good sound - wouldn't go as far as to say they're not grossly overpriced, but they're good
I was excited to get the in ur beats headphones they have good sound but they do not stay in the ear long they constantly come out of my ears when listening to music
I contacted the manufacturer and got no response and contacted customer service on amazon and they did not send me a new pair
I wish I had a better story to write, if customer service is reading this someone  help solve my problem
I could not go back to regular cheap headphones
huge difference and definitely worth the money
It was a great buy
I use these for hours on end each day and some times fall asleep with them in my ears
The sound quality is there but the customer service and build quality is not
I honestly think that if you want the name of dre you will get them and be happy until they fail on you
My cord is starting to fray and have static come through the earbuds
Monster said it was my fault and not covered by warranty, like they said with my other beats I own
If you need a bang around set go with skull candy
The back end service is not there for monster and is one of the worst costumer services out there I have dealt with
I hope no one else will have my problem and i look like an idiot for posting this but i'm let down again by monster after putting out a crap load of money for one of their products
in the end i guess shame on me
Its an awesome chocie but the picture is wrong from the item your buying just to let you know
I would go with these than from the Tours or the iBeats
This product is absolutely one of my favorites because it has a very good sound and wonderful effects that went above my expectations
Also, the base is great and the sound quality is wonderful
Therefore, anyone who loves music you would need to get these right away
I wanted to get a trendy but useful gift for my niece's 14th birthday
The Beats brand is hot hot right now, and she is always plugged into her devices, so I thought these would be a hit, and I was right
She loves them, and they cancel out her parents' speaking to her and her brother's chatter - both of which she sees as a definite advantages
Bought these for my son for Xmas - he loved the sound
One side stopped working after about 2 months
Read the reviews before I bought them but everything I want to buy always has good reviews and bad reviews
Seemed like enough good ones but i think they're from people who hadn't had them very long
At any rate, as many others mentioned, one side went out
Sending in for replacement - hopefully those will last a little longer though it will cost me for shipping
Good sound but not worth the price for such a short time
Unfortunately, UrBeats fell short of adequate
I was extremely disappointed in this set of in-ear headphones
When I first bought it, the presentation was extremely impressive
However, the product itself did not live up to the hype or my expectations
I like to listen to reggae and the Urbeats headphones couldn't handle the bass
Any low tone in the melody would scatter and it sounded like tin cans banging on each other
The in-ear headphones that came with my iPhone had better quality
I'm a bit confused about the rave reviews on here
I guess if you're going from a $20 skull candy in-ear phones to this, then yes, I hope Urbeats is better
However, for someone who is used to Bose in-ear headphones, like me, Urbeats can barely make subpar
Unless you have all extremely high-quality audio on your device, you will be disappointed in the quality of the sound from these earbuds
I recommend spending about half on another set unless everything you will be listening to is studio quality
Stupid cat, always eatin my stuff
Already had a pair of these, dont really like how they fit for long periods of time but I liked them enough to buy them again
The sound is phenomenal, I ride my motorcycle with them and they're ridiculously noise canceling that I have to wear them with one in and one out so I can hear other traffic
These earphones might be a little pricy but the bass is incredible and they look great and they are durable
I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY FIANCE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY IN NOVEMBER, WE HAD TO SEND THE FIRST PAIR BACK BECAUSE ONE OF THE EARBUDS WENT OUT AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS
AND NOW THE SECOND PAIR ARE BROKEN
THE EARBUD IS NO LONGER ATTACHED TO THE WIRE,IT JUS DECIDED TO COME LOOSE I GUESS AND THE WARRANTY ON THESE HEAD PHONES DOESNT REALLY COVER ANYTHING BUT DEFECT ON INSIDE, NOTHING ON THE OUTSIDE
Great buy
Love these
Definitely recommend this product to my friends and to all of amazon shoppers
I just bought them and so far-so good
I will be sure to update my review if anything changes
The product was sent in a very excellent condition
I really like them
I recommend them to other people who are going to buy these they are very good quality
Beats any in ear buds that I have ever used
The sound is really, really great, I would recommend this product
I got this to go with my HP laptop with beats, great quality (sound and physical), the cord never tangles
First off, I didn't buy this on Amazon
I bought this from Target with a two year warranty for $9 bucks
Like everyone else I had trouble with earphones always spending and spending on skull candy,Sony,Samsung
etc
So many have messed up,cut,one ear blew out
poorly made
I debated on buying this for $100 but I spend much more on buying earphones every week
I finally caved in and let me tell you this was the best purchase ever 6 months in not a single problem
Good bass,nicely made,nice fit I got the white and red the look is just amazing
What I don't recommend is buying online because many times I bought fake beats for $50-60 hoping I can save a few bucks
There are so many counterfeits of Dre beats so be careful
Best buy,Walmart,Target I recommend and get that 2 year warranty that $9 bucks will save you
sounds great  but will break very easy, didn't  last the week but the sound was great
got my money back
The headphones came just like it was described
They were packaged just like new
I didn't have any problems at all
I even received them earlier than expected as well
My son really liked them, until one side stopped working
Don't bother opening a ticket for service or help, they wont get back to you
I called and they will be sending something
The process will be 2-4 weeks IF approved
SO dissappointed
Everything was brand new and sealed as described on the item page
This is exactly what I wanted, thank you so much
Blocks out most noise the beat is great for music with bass, Use them mostly at the gym or on long distance runs and its a great fit
High quality sound for lil beats
I gave it four star because I'll use these for working out, I hope they will last longer the my beats solo
This product brand is not ment for cold it will malfuntion
They sound awesome the bass is great and they look cool and you can take them anywere I woukd recommend these
The only way to listen to personal music is with a pair of beats
The buds are comfortable
The white is clean and looks nice with the red b and cord
I purchased this Earphones for my teen-aged brother for Christmas
He was happy
But then I try it - sound is excellent
Much better than I expected for this price
So I purchase another one Earphones for me
I got these as a christmas gift and the left side just broke because it fell out of my ear when i was in the car and it hit my skatevoard i checked to see the damage because they are metal and can get marks/scratched easily:/ and now it stopped working:( but i have warranty so its all good ish
well beats are the best in my opinion, i like the heavy base, but, i already own the ibeats, and when i researched these, i was informed that the wire would be stronger and untangle-able, however i received the urbeats that where made for the HTC phone, while still amazing ear buds, they weren't exactly what i wanted, i was thinking about returning them, but that's a hassle, and i still have my ibeats, so i have my back up pair of beats and i'm happy, i just wish i had the untangle-able wire
Super design built tough made to last returned the tours they never would stay in place my ears poor design pick these up find them on amazon at a great rate
GOT HIM A BEATS BOX AND NOW HE CAN ENJOY THE AWESOME SOUND WITHOUT INTERRUPTING OUR PROGRAMMING
WE LOVE THESE
Sound quality is mediocre at best
Not much better than apple earbuds
The packaging & presentation were the best thing about them
Essentially, your paying $100 for a good maketing gimmick
These headphones have a ton of BASS
So if you want your eardrums blasted with Bass then get these
The Vocals are decent but they could be better if the bass wasn't so heavy
But my daughter loves the headphones, so I guess I got everything I paid for
Don't buy these
They sound great, are comfortable but they break so easily
I've had two pairs in about 6 weeks, using them consistently every day and with both of them the right earphone shorted out and you could barely hear anything
If you're going to use these at all, they'll break and it's sad, because Ir really enjoyed them when they worked, but they just break so easily
Got these for my daughter for a Christmas present, she has used them every day since then
She loves them
I just purchased these urbeats from Best Buy last night
Took them home, was impressed by the presentation of the box, there was a case for the extra ear cushions, a carrying case, and user guide/warranty info tucked neatly on the opening flap
I plugged these into my Galaxy Note 2, and started listening to some Dubstep
This one song in particular: Imp Box 2011 by Tryfexta, I kept playing over and over again because the bass in it simply just blew me away
So far so good
I then for the heck of it, grabbed the stock earphones that came with my Note 2 that I never opened from it's plastic bag till now
Did a switcharoo, plugged them in and WTF
The Note 2 buds sounded exactly like the urbeats, complete with thunderous bass & all
Only difference between the 2, I noticed that the Samsung oem's seemed wider than the beats
Can someone else please confirm the sound sig on oem earbuds that come with the Note 2 and I think also the SGS 3
I dont know if I should return the urbeats or just hold onto them
Someone asked me if the Urbeats are worth the money,  I will say that sound is good,  offers some noise canceling, and is a lot better than the stock iPhone ear buds
I also like the fact that these are in ear and  am not walking around with huge headphones on when traveling through airports
They are holding up pretty good after a couple months of use,  I would tell people if you want a head phone that sounds pretty good and that you will keep for a while then get them
These headphones feel apart completely after less than a month and a half
My daughter was really wanting these as her main Christmas present, and they are garbage now
What really upsets me is that the refund for this item is only 45 days and then you can only receive a partial refund and you have to pay for shipping both ways
Dr
Dre should hide his face in public, anyone buying these things is making a foolish mistake, foolish
Do not waste your money, I repeat, do not waste your money
Headphones/ear buds already broke and had to send back to company to replace
Cost a  lot of money to break so quickly
Sounded great for 2 months then the left earbud shorted out
I'm a 55 plus year old female and did not use these as a young person would
Learned my lesson
will shop in a store from now on
Thank you so much for the In Ear Hendphones, I really enjoy this product
It is like new and It came packed in a very well matter
Thnk you so much
I purchased a pair of iBeats about a year ago
The iBeats which were manufactured by Monster were an amazing pair of headphones
1
The cable was durable and heavy
2
The buds were heavy and had a polished metal finish
3
The sound was crisp and powerful with slightly boosted bass that just enough but not too much
About a week ago the cable started shorting at the tip near the connector
Every other brand I have purchased typically lasted three months before shorting while these lasted a year
I went to exchange my iBeats today through the Protection Plan I had purchased with the buds but apparently monster and Beats by Dre parted ways and they are now being manufactured by someone else and have a new name urbeats
The packaging looked the same, and the image on the box looked descent
When I got home and opened the box, let me tell you what I took out of the box was nothing near the quality of the pair I had exchanged
These urbeats 1
The flat wire cable is thin and feels cheap
2
The buds are no longer heavy and shiny metal, but feel like cheap plastic, though the manufacturer's homepage says they are brushed metal
3
They sound cheap, definitely not the crisp powerful sound delivered by the iBeats
I really feel like they belonged more on the racks by the registers rather than with a price tag of $99
I've purchased  $14
99 Skull Candy headphones that have a richer sound than these
I had to double check the box that they were actually Beats by Dre and not Cheats by Dre
This is the gift for my friend
I don't know what she feels or something but i think it's a good gift to give
Love These Earbuds
Great Sound And Quality Would Definitely Buy These Again
Highly Recommend To Everyone
The Bass Coming Out Of These Small Buds Is Insane
I've tried every bud under the sun
I went to these after experiencing audio nirvana with the first generation
Problem is, the way these are designed (they are elongated, so they slip too far into your ears) you WILL blow out your eardrums if you listen to these over 50% on an iPhone
I hate writing negatively about these, but if you go against my warning, you'll have two options: listen to your music less than 50% and no bass or crank up to your heart's delight and lose your hearing
My ears have pounded for four months as if I was under water
The throbbing finally went away
I cannot, in good conscious, recommend these buds
If you can listen to these safely, awesome on you
But
you've been warned
Well the ur beats from dr dre are good but over priced
Honestly I think they should only cost 60
They have good bass but my right earbud just stopped working
The earphones I do recommend is munitio earphones there better in bass and in price:)
Looks good, sounds good, and the cord doesn't tangle
Also own Atomic Flyods MiniDart with remote control but feel that urBeats is much better value
One word: Garbage
I bought these with the allure of being able to control the music on my HTC One
Pros:  - Track Navigation does work, although laggy at times  - It's Beats, so you may get oohs and aahs from peopleBut to an audiophile --Cons:  - Bass is too much to the point of saturation  - Mid-range is not very crisp  - Treble is almost non-existantFor this price range, I would recommend the Klipsch S4A's
Much better frequency range and clarity at a cheaper price (Controls may or may not work with the Klipsch Android App
I haven't tested this)
If you're dead-set on purchasing these, then at least pair them with a music app that has an equalizer i
e
Neutron
Unfortunately, this doesn't even save it for me, but at least it makes the headphones sound better than stock
This link is a must-read for anyone considering purchasing earbuds in general:http://www
head-fi
org/t/478568/
I bought these earbuds as a replacement for my diddybeats & I have to say I like them better they are lighter & when it comes to earbuds in my opinion is something of an essential quality but speaking strictly these earbuds I give them 2 thumbs up
Bought these for my son for Xmas - he loved the sound
One side stopped working after about 2 months
Read the reviews before I bought them but everything I want to buy always has good reviews and bad reviews
Seemed like enough good ones but i think they're from people who hadn't had them very long
At any rate, as many others mentioned, one side went out
Sending in for replacement - hopefully those will last a little longer though it will cost me for shipping
Good sound but not worth the price for such a short time
While they are pretty to look at, and sounded great at first; the overall built quality is that of a $30 ear-buds
I have never used mine for exercise (no sweat damage)and they only lasted about 6 months
First, one side got substantially quieter, month later the other and now only one ear-bud is just barely working
$100 piece of junk
stay away
The mids are good but the bass is a complete disappointment
I'd say there is no bass at all
To do justice, I started with Dre's "Chronic 2001" only to be pissed with the highs and lows
Then I listened to Skrillex, I realized the mids were pretty good except for the bass
But for $100 I'm not going to waste my money in this mediocre s***
A $20 skullcandy earphones outputs better than this
One thing I appreciate about the earphone is the design which is definitely attractive
The past two weeks I had been hesitant to buy these just as a buyer below had mentioned, but I figured why not, I can always return it if I didn't like it
I'm SO glad I bought it
The BASS and VOCALS are great on these earbuds and work great with music for those; however, when you get into alternative rock/rock or any genre that has a mix of instruments, the sound isn't so great
Or rather, sounds like any other cheap earbuds
I love their design, they feel very comfortable, and have great overall sound and noise cancellation
My MAIN concern is that about half of the reviews on here and other places say that these earbuds break within a few weeks so I hope they last me at least half a year
I do take care of my earbuds all the time so I'm expecting them last for awhile
I hope but I will update this review if for whatever reason they break within a few weeks
The pricing is a bit EHHH, to me
To be honest, I think a lot of the money for this product goes to the packaging and Dr
Dre
The packaging is REALLY nice
but makes you think, is this TOO nice for a $100 product
Anyways, I'm not exactly sure that these earbuds are worth $100 bucks, but for what it's worth, I don't mind spending the 100 bucks for these earbuds
just as long as they last me for a couple months at the least
Pros:*Very nice packaging
*Design/style and color are awesome
I wanted the white-red ones but I figured the white part would get dirty easily*FEELS durable, the cord I mean
Most earbuds I've used always use the thin, cylindrical cord but this one uses the flat one which makes it seem/feel more durable (I hope it really is)*Comes with a nice, durable rubber pouch to hold the buds and comes with extra buds to change sizes*Great noise cancelling*Very comfortable fit*VERY nice bass AND vocalsCons:*Cord is kind of short, wouldn't do so well when working out/jogging*I don't really like the play button or whatever it is on the cord, makes it look bulky/uneven in terms of design*Hopefully it doesn't break
I bought these headphones today at Walmart
I was going to buy the white model but they only had the black model so I bought that
So when I went home and started listening, these were my impressions:Packaging:The packaging of the urBeats is, in my opinion, one of the best for any headphones out there
Beats by Dre really worked hard to create this packaging
It includes some manuals, one of which showcases all of their headphones that they make
Also, a nice addition is a Beats sticker to place wherever you want
For some reason, the focus on packaging reminds me of Apple, as they also supply nice packaging with stickers
They also supply different size ear tips, and a small case which I will get to in the next section
But what I'm trying to say is that they worked very hard on the packaging
Case:These headphones include a small case with Beats branding
They are like a pouch, but they include magnets on the top to keep the case shut and secure
This case also came with the previous iBeats model, but this has a lot less branding, with the iBeats' case having a Monster logo and the words "Sound Really Matters"
The only bad thing about this case is that you have to try to get the buds deep inside but other than that I love this case
Design:As these are Beats headphones, you will expect great design
And it delivers on that
The earphones themselves are made of metal, and they kind of look like an in-ear version of their Mixr headphones
The cord is flat and tangle-free
I've tried to tangle these things, and 90% of the time they untangle with no problem
The cord is red, which I personally like, but if you want a lower-profile headphone, this might bother you
It also includes a remote with a built in microphone for calls
But, the volume up and down only works on select Apple products, and only the center button and mic works on Android and Blackberry devices
For some reason, my Atrix 2 won't seem to work with the remote at all, so if you own that phone, that's something to take note of
Comfort:These headphones are okay in this category, but for some reason, these headphones cause discomfort in my left ear
Of course, your mileage may vary, but it has caused pain in my left ear
(Which isn't a good thing
) But for some odd reason, my right ear comes out alright
And now we go into the world of the human ear
Not today
But, I can't say for comfort 100 percent, but your mileage may vary and if they are uncomfortable you can try the different size tips included with the headphones
Update on Comfort - 4/11/2013For some reason the urBeats fit comfortably in my left ear now
Hmm
maybe they got used to them
Sound:Bass
The Beats line of headphones are famous (or infamous) for their bass, so if you don't like bass and are planning to buy these earbuds, don't
These headphones are designed to output bass
And, unlike other Beats headphones, these don't overpower
I'm not a basshead, but I like the bass that these headphones give out
The mids and highs sound great
I have listened to rock, rap and acoustic music on these headphones, and these tackle all of them really well
Since these headphones are sponsored by rapper and record producer Dr
Dre, I listened to one of his tracks, "Forgot About Dre" on these
These headphones tackle the song very well
The bass is well defined, the vocals are clear, and everything just sounds great
I listened to other music like The White Stripes "Little Acorns" where there is just narrative in the beginning and hard guitar in the end
The headphones also take this song really well
The guitar is great and the narrative in the beginning sounds crisp, clean and clear
Acoustic music also sounds great on here
But if you are an audiophile you will not like these headphones, as these are sculpted to a specific market
The Verdict:If you like bass, and you want some good looking headphones with good sound these headphones are for you
But, if you hate bass, or if you're an audiophile, these are not going to be the headphones for you
Although the comfort may vary, I think this is a great product for the $100 selling price
PROSThe sound qualityThe smooth heavy bassThe packagingCONSYou can't move around without having to readjust themAbout every 20-30 minutes of moving they may fall outThe wire it comes with is either too long or too short [@ gym]
I'm extremely confused as to why the reviews aren't great on this product & not just on here, but the best buy website, Amazon, Walmart and Target as well
Let me tell you- I've been thinking about these earbuds for the last few weeks and I waited for a while to purchase them to make sure that I wasn't going to waste money and hope they wouldn't disappoint
I only have one friend that I know of who has a pair of these, but he has the tours
I asked him how he felt about his and he said they were amazing
I'm actually stoked that I decided to buy them
Since there are a lot of people saying that their headphones seem to break somewhat easy, and the left bud blows out- of course I went with the warranty (actually purchased them from walmart, and got the $9 warranty)
I've had these for an hour now
The TV is on in the background and it's set at a decent volume, I know I'd definitely be able to hear it with my apple headphones on
Can't hear it even a little bit with these on
Pink Floyd just came on my iphone and it's actually fantastic
I'm hoping I never have to use the warranty but I'm very happy I got it
Also, people are out of their minds- the bass on these is actually FANTASTIC, you can actually feel it in your chest
It's way too loud turned all the way up
If you're having a moral dilemma as to whether or not you should buy them- you should buy them
If you still aren't sure, save your money for them and I promise when you deicide to go with them that they will be worth the wait

My old iBeats broke in 5 months of use, but I got urBeats as a replacement through the warranty
I love the improvements on these headphones
The wires are tangle-proof, the remote is much more heavy duty, and the bass on these things is still unbelievable for headphones so small
The bass is not overpowering, but anyone could easily tell that it is much crisper and more accurate than on the iBeats
They stay in my ears well whether I'm active or not
On a side note, the case that was included is kind of frustrating, because the metal strips (that you pinch to open and close the case) are very strong and are hard to open
Besides that, I can easily say that I'm very satisfied with these headphones
I've only owned these for a month now, but I'll be updating my review to tell how the hold up
I've owned these for over a year now, and they still hold up great
I haven't kept them pristine for sure, but they have held up to my abuse pretty well
The remote still works, cord is in good shape without any fraying even though I've strained it once or twice accidentally
Sent them through the washer and dryer on accident as well
They still work without any change in sound quality
Pretty neat little headphones, definitely would be worth your pay if you can afford them
You won't ever switch back to a cheap pair after using these
Definitely recommended
The UrBeats aren't worth the box they come in
With a $100 price point Beats By Dre has clearly milked the marketing cow
The celebrity endorsement, high dollar advertising and expensive packaging are why these things cost $100
Don't be fooled by the premium price point, you will be happier with the audio quality of $30 pair
I purchased mine from Best Buy in November and last week the left side quit working
Defective, I called Beats customer service, thankfully they are still under warranty - 1 year
The customer service rep was very understanding and polite but that's about the only positive thing I recieved from this purchase
I actually spoke with two customers service reps and both aknowledged that this is a commom problem with this product UrBeats
I'm not neive enough to think that any consumer goods company has 100% quality control and I don't typically waste my time writing reviews, but the fact that they are positioning this brand as premium is absurd
Not only are the products not premium but neither is the customer service
I was extremely surprised that I have to pay for these defective things twice $99 the first time and now I have to send these things in, pay for shipping and pay again wiht 2-4 weeks of my time while I wait for them to replace these things
Meanwhile prime motorcycling season is underway and I will have to defer back to my old Sony ear buds
thanks Sony for offering quality products at a fair price
They are good when it comes to listening , but comfort isn't that focused on
They make my ears hear if I listen for a long period of time
Edit:Great Headphone
Ripped Open Package Immediately When It Came
The EarPhones are Great and Worth the 99
95
They Sound Fantastic, Hear Stuff I Never Heard With EarPod
Note - Find the Correct Size EarBud or It Won't Sound Good-Ignore the Caps, I Like Capitalizing First Letter :P
These are the greatest earbuds out there
It comes with the nicest carry case and comes with 4 spare comfort rubbers of different sizes
I like the sound of these headphones
I find the cord a little stiff, but overall I am happy with the performance of the headphones
It's all it said it can do,it's just nice
The volume and sound is very good
Everyone should get 1,everyone I know want 1so I might get them 1
They sound great, deep bass, solid pitch/treble/mids
They look great, the casing is clean, and the cord is greats
After two weeks the cord starting peeling and the left headphone stopped working
If you take perfect care of them you will be fine, but if not you will break them
Worked really well for the first 3 weeks and then started breaking up
We were very disappointed
:( the sound quality is fantastic
until it starts breaking up and crackling
Of course, we purchased 2 pairs and the pair that is malfunctioning is used constantly, the other pair has not been used yet
Bought these as a gift for two of my sons
They both love them
I would have liked to see these in many more colors and not so expensive
I always love Beats headphones, and these are no exception
very portable and I love the flat chord
they also stay in really well when I go running
These are great headphones
They are really well packaged
Feels heavier than you would expect
They sound great and block out background noise extremely well
I recommend them
Sound Gooooooooooood
Design GooD
Have no regrets
Buy here next earphone
I like it
I ordered black and received white, granted they may have been sold out but, no one let me know
In the future it would be nice to get some warning
my daughter loves them
we gave them to her for christmas
She has had other kinds but said there is nothing that compairs to them
Love the sound
Can't get any better than beats
Great bass
Great quality and love the white
easier to keep track of these
I currently have Meelectroncis M6, Ultimate Ears Superfi and V-Moda Crossfade LP
I replaced my Superfi with the M6 because I didn't want to spend too much on headphones to work out in
Little did I know that sweat will break IEMs not desigened for it
$$$ lesson learned
I'm no audiophile, but after testing out various headphones, I guess I'm 80% bass head most of the time
I bought the urBeats to pair with my HTC 8x after I plugged in a pair of my friends Beats Solos
The difference was bass heavnly clear at a very low volume level
I love my V-Moda cans, but the reality is for my use case, urBeats made sense with my budget and my phone
Pros:- Build quality is better than most have reported
Cord is thin, but far from flemsy
- Tangle free cord is nice- Bass is great - I've burned them in for about 2 days and I think it made a difference
could be just me
- Case is very useful for more than just the headphones
- Design is a major plus for me
I like the metal and black/red color
Cons:-Price
I wish they were more like $80, but not too bad
-Eartips supply could have been better
M6's had at least 2 more options
Superfi came with foam tips plus more assortment of tips
If you have a beats powered device, I'd say its worth it
The sound just sounds different in a good way
I know I've read users talking bad about the Beats by Dre brand, but in my case I believe it delivered
These are not recommended for the audiophile or those who don't like a lot of thump in their listening experience
Others have reported fitting problems, and I'd say those are valid if you've never worked with IEMs before
I'm working with finding the perfect fit and so far I'm using the triple flange tips that came with my M6 and they work great
These IEMs are not for working out, so don't even think you can
Conclusion:  If you are a Beats fan or just like heavy bass, I'd recommend them
Especially if you have a Beats powered device
If you have an HTC 8x, I think its worth a look
UPDATE:  After a couple of months with these IEMs they are much better than I thought it would be
It really depends on the source (mp3 player, smartphone, other) but in general there is a lot more to these than just plain bass
My current set up is using Sony's MW600 wireless headphone adaptor and Motorola's Motoactv watch
The Motoactv tends to lean bass heavy on the EQ, but I think it works perfect
I listen to a lot of R&B, and that works well with urBeats
What was most surprising was when playing more acoustic/vocal centered music (Cannonball by Damian Rice or any Tyrone Well's songs)the vocals appear to be more up front
I'm not an audiophile, however, I've researched enough to understand that urBeats won't have an extended sound stage, but there is sound separation
The bass from the guitar will not over power the vocals and the highs are not bad here
I've enjoyed my time with the urBeats and will continue to use them for my R&B/HipHop music
I will be purchasing a paire of IEMs that have even more stage and imaging though
Sony's XBA series looks to be my next purchase because it has warmer tones than your average armature driver (which isn't exactly flat eq)UPDATE: 11/13/2013So the durability of these IEMs are questionable
I don't run with them and do nothing extreamly out of the ordinary
I have stuffed them into coat pockets and regular pockets which I think could be what caused them to stop working completely on smartphones and most recently mp3 players
Sound will not come if I use it on my HTC 8X or BB Z10
It kind of worked with my iPod nano/iPod 4th gen, but the right bud no longer works without wiggling the cable
I purchased these because they were advertised as durable, but that is definitely not the case here
I've adjusted my rating from 4 to 2 stars
They lasted almost a year, but at $99 you expect it to last far longer especially if they are being used for commuting and office scenarios
This is the WORST headphones I have ever purchased
They were defective right out of the box, the right ear bud arrived with a short in the cord
I noticed that the sound was not even close to balanced between right and left so when I took out the left ear but I had No sound coming from the right
I discovered that if I wiggled the cord I would get sound fade in and out
This is really a shame, and a sham of a product
Gave these as a Christmas gift to my girlfriend
The audio was great but within 10 minutes of her using them the same day the left earbud & wire literally fell out from the button
$100 set of "High End" earphones and thy break that quickly
Insane
Thankfully I kept the receipt
Never buying another pair of Beats/Monster anything, ever again
I just bought these after I had to return my Klipsch Image S4A (which I received as a gift from a Secret Santa party) due to improper fit
These sounds ALMOST as good as the Klipsch Image S4A, however they are slightly more bass heavy
For me, noise isolation is a big deal, so the Bose IE2 wouldn't have worked
As far as proper fit, urBeats aren't a perfect fit, but they are a better fit for my ears than the S4As
The only thing that I wish Beats wouldn't changed was the bright RED colored wires
or possibly provided some more options for the colors
I just want to enjoy the music and don't want the added attention the bright colors bring
As for build quality, they seem legit for now, but time will tell
Great jaw dropping noise never broke on me and has a great fit
I totally love this thing super comfortable and nice bass and treble
Not as nice as the tours though
Love these
Just got them in
Not a fan of the price, but I feel like they were money well spent to make a fashion statement
Monster (maker of these headphones) does not stand behind their warranty on headphones
Previous pair of Beats fell apart during normal handling--I treated them like they were a newborn baby, and the earpiece literally fell into two pieces
After contacting customer service by phone and sending them in for warranty service, part of the headphones (not all of them) was returned to me and the warranty claim was denied for "out of normal use" damage
No other explanation was provided, and customer service on phone is completely unable to do anything--they state that the repair facility's decision is final and there's no supervisor that can do anything to fix that
A month later, I still don't have the piece back that they kept when I sent the headphones in, and I'm out > $100 bucks
It will be my last Monster product EVER
I bought these for my 15 years old nephew and he loves them
He said that the sound clarity is great and there very comfortable to wear for long periods of time
I like them alot
I was expecting more bass, but the sound is awesome
best earphones i've ever had
& Amazon was also Awesome for getting my urBeats to me fast
All Smiles
Skullcandy S6HSDZ-058 Hesh 2
0 with Detatchable Cable - Rastai just brought these headphones and i must say that they are ok but not the best headphones ever
the only reason why i brought these is because i am sick and tired of running through skull candy headphones so much
to me they fit well the sound is pretty good and the wire is awesome
would i recommend anybody to buy these
well if you have money like that and you want to look good then yes other than that there are soooo many better headphones out there then dre beats or monster like sol republics or the headphones by the rza or better yet the the skull candy hesh
SOL REPUBLIC Tracks Ultra On-Ear Headphones with Remote and Mic (Blue)WeSC RZA Street Headphones (Black/Blue)
Got sent white urbeats, instead of the black urbeats that I purchased, even on my receipt It stated black urbeats, dissapointed
my orders from Amazon is always on time and sometimes even faster then i aspect been with Amazon for more than 7 years the best deals are here
I was told beats are the best headphone around
You can  hear every sound as well as words to the song no matter how low or loud the volume is
I gave this rating because they deserve it
my son loves them he tells me every day
Everyone who listens to these on my evo 4glte is blown away including myself
How do they fit all that bass into those little things
Still overpriced in my opinion but seems to be a quality product all the same
My order is a black one, but I got a white one
However, quality is good, so I think it's okay
I am a headphones/earphones buff and I have to say, the new "urbeats" are by far the best earphones out there thus far
One complaint that I have always had with earphones that that earphones as a whole wouldn't stay in your ear ( except the boses' our course )
I purchased the "tours" way back and they would never stay in my ear but the sound was great
I never purchased the "ibeats" b/c there was a lot of bad reviews so I ignored them
I went on to purchase skullcandy's, there sound was great but there ear-buds had the same problem, they wouldn't stay in my ear
So, when I saw these, I thought I would give them a try
I have to say, the "urbeats" did not disappoint, the sound is great and they actually stay in my ear
I have had them for a couple of days now and I love'em
If you have $100 to throw around then I highly recommend these , if not, then I would either go with bose or skullcandy
Ok ill admit these are amazing but i bought mine from best buy a trusted place(so i know it wasent fake)they have the best quility l
and i love bass im all about and these have it
But the bad thing is the left earphone goes out after just a few mounths
you are better of getting some other earphones (I hope this review helps)
I ordered black and received white, granted they may have been sold out but, no one let me know
In the future it would be nice to get some warning
Fast shipping
And amazing, can't wait to give to my mom
She's going to be so happy, she has aways wanted beats
Love the quality of these
Love the color, hate that the microphone is on the left and none of the ear buds fit me well
I have never had an issue with ear buds before, always found at least one set included that fit well but not these
These over priced cheap, tastelessly designed headphones are nothing more than a successful ad campaign geared toward the same generation that loves the way 128kps mp3's sound and think dancing and lip syncing are the most important thing a musical 'artist" can do on stage
Enjoy listening to your trash on these pieces of trash
Buy a pair of Sennheiser headphones and enjoy "real" music
These headphones sound great, never knew my iPhone music could sound so good
The fit is perfect blocking out just enough outside noise
While the price might seem a little high for a pair of headphones the sound is well worth it
I made this review after i bought these from Best Buy
it goes over the Features,durability pros and cons and if I like them
If you want to see the review click this link( [

I got these earphones with my Rezound and the sound quality was amazing
I loved these and the only reason i gave these a 4 star was because they arent the toughest, not the biggest deal though
I used these very often until i lost them at school one day
Overall these earphones were great i loved them, i would definitely consider buying another pair as soon as i get $100
Also, too be honest $100 for a pair of earphones are a bit pricey dont you think
Purchased this item on November 18, 2012
received the wrong color
Ordered "white" but got "black" Decided to over look the color issue, plugged into two different devices and every thing sounds all robotic
cant return cause i pay a ton of custom duties for importing into my country plus its going to cost almost what the item is worth in shipping to return it
feels like getting pick pocketed, now i have to go buy another sad
I bought urbeats by Dr
dre
for my AT&T galaxy S3 (SIII)
Music worked great
I was able to successfully control play, pause, next track, previous track, volume up, volume down after I installed "Jays audio control" app from play store
However sad news is that the mic is not working
Also these completely blocked from external noise which I was not a big fan of
The sound quality and build quality is great but these have to go back because of mic
The sound was great
for 2 months, then the left ear bud crapped out on me (most likely a frayed wire)
Prior to this the paint managed to chip off the buds themselves
I took great care of these things, never putting a strain on the wire, never wraping them in a tight ball, and never knoting them
I had to revert back to my $20 JVC ear buds that seem to be able to handel any kind of abuse imaginable
If you're spending this kind of money, these people have absolutly no excuse for how flimsy their product is
I really wanted to like these headphones, the sound is great, they fit well
However the construction is BRUTAL
I have gone through two pairs in the last 4 months
The same problem both times, the left head phone (the one with the remote) began to cut out, and eventually stopped working altogether
I was very disappointed
Spend $100+ on headphones, you expect them to last more than a couple of months
Save your money
They need to improve the durability before these will be any good

First off the sound is amazing
They sound better than any other in ear headphone I have ever heard including Bose
Bass is just right and I really like they way they have several tips so you get a great ear fit
Better than the 2-3 that come with others
Wife purchased them for my birthday so I could listen to my Ipod while riding my motorcycle
First set lasted exactly 1 year as I didn't really use them a lot
Summer comes around and I start using them and they fail in 2 months of use
I had purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy so they replace them no problem
2 months of using the new set and the left ear bud starts crackling
Take them back to Best Buy and exchange them for the Soul by Ludacris
While not quite as accurate in sonic clarity they have serious bass and so far (6 months) not a single hiccup
The other Beats headphones are wonderful, I have a pair of the studios, never gave me a problem and have had them for 2 years
But the ear buds are not durable enough for me
I guess if you sit at a desk and use them they may last you awhile but I wouldn't suggest taking them outside
This is a pair of brand new designed white model of urBeats
When I first saw them as soon as I unwrap the package, I was fully amazed by its attractive looking
You cannot imagine these cute buds have any relations with the old model iBeats
Or, you might think iBeats are pretty designed and made with bright white plastics, you now, however, will think those can be directly thrown
What I have to say is the new wires which look like that of Beats Tour
Actually, wires of new urBeats are narrower and thinner than that of Tour
This is the biggest improvement compared with the old iBeats
When talk about the sound performance, many anti-Beats will jump out saying "Oh, well, Monster sounds good now, since Beats left
" I always consider that is something like anti-apple fans doing
I would like to praise Sen's stable performance and AudioTech's cold sounding as well as Beats' balance
These new urBeats give you a new feeling than old iBeats do
The bass part sounds heavier, and the tremble part sounds outstanding than before
That makes a close step to Tour's performance, there is still a gap though
If you are pursuing an extreme listening experience with this kinda in-ear buds instead of over-ear headphones, buy Beats Tour
However, if you wanna find a pair of good sounding beautiful earbuds to replace the ones you got accompany from your iPhone, iPod, or other brands electronic devices, urBeats is a good enough choice
So, this shall be separately stocked instead of sold and commented together with old ones
The new urBeats is in every aspect a brand new model
I would give full five stars
I'm an up and coming audiophile and when my friend told me he just got these "new beats" I had the urge to listen since so many people seem to like Beats by Dre
Replacing iBeats and still retaining the $99 price tag, I was unimpressed when I listened
Sure the housing seems more durable but for this price you'd expect a single balanced armature driver rather than a dynamic speaker
These should be price at $50 or even less, of course the rest are paid for the "b" on the side  of the earbud
What Beats should make is a dual driver earbud (lows/highs) so bass quality isn't sacrificed, but rather addressed with its own driver since I understand overwhelming bass is the selling point of Beats ear/headphones
The cable is nice, but it'd be better if it was detachable; however, that's reserved for higher-end earbuds
The colors are nice and the 'buds are very stylish for sure and possibly adequate for the 256kbps songs bought from iTunes, but if you're serious about sound quality switch to something else
Every time I listen to a video where someone is speaking, they all of the sudden have bad grammar
This problem does not occur on any of my other headphones, only these
I believe the problem is caused by the name "urBeats", but I have yet to find a solution
