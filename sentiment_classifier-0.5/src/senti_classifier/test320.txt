344 *** negative *** It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
347 *** negative *** pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
340 *** positive *** They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
348 *** positive *** i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
349 *** positive *** i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
2318 *** positive *** Wonderful zooming.
2314 *** positive *** Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
2315 *** positive *** OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.
2311 *** positive *** The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
296 *** positive *** Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
295 *** positive *** The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
293 *** negative *** Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
291 *** negative *** Not to mention it has shit gigs.
271 *** negative *** MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.
273 *** negative *** Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
274 *** negative *** The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.
275 *** negative *** It is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.
277 *** negative *** The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used, and the command prompt would not work at all.
278 *** negative *** The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
279 *** negative *** The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.
2260 *** positive *** The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
2261 *** positive *** The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!
2266 *** negative *** As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
2267 *** positive *** As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;
2443 *** positive *** Boots up fast and runs great!
2447 *** positive *** Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
2448 *** positive *** The pictures are clear as can be.
108 *** negative *** It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
109 *** negative *** Then it ceased charging at all.
102 *** positive *** The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
103 *** negative *** The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.
101 *** positive *** I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
107 *** negative *** My laptop now has no battery.
105 *** negative *** That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
2047 *** negative *** I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.
2049 *** negative *** It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
2689 *** negative *** I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
2684 *** positive *** Good price.
2686 *** negative *** Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
2680 *** positive *** Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
2682 *** negative *** Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
99 *** negative *** After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
98 *** negative *** It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
91 *** negative *** Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
90 *** negative *** The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
92 *** negative *** The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
97 *** negative *** First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
1623 *** negative *** With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
1993 *** negative *** Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
1620 *** negative *** I will never go back to Windows!
1995 *** negative *** I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
1997 *** negative *** it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.
2860 *** positive *** But, for the cost this is a winner.
2863 *** positive *** The price and features more than met my needs.
2864 *** positive *** I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.
2865 *** positive *** The feature are good enough for what I need.
2867 *** positive *** It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.
2868 *** positive *** True quality at a great price!
550 *** negative *** The speakers on it are useless too.
552 *** negative *** Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
1191 *** positive *** Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
1190 *** negative *** Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.
1193 *** negative *** Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.
1192 *** negative *** The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
1197 *** negative *** Finally, the biggest problem has been tech support.
1196 *** negative *** The Apple will run Internet Explorer, but at an amazingly slow rate.
1758 *** negative *** The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
1757 *** positive *** Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
1175 *** positive *** The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2
1173 *** positive *** (No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
1172 *** positive *** I ordered through MacMall, which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.
1171 *** positive *** I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
1179 *** negative *** First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
1284 *** negative *** Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
1288 *** negative *** We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.
1573 *** positive *** It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
684 *** positive *** The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.
687 *** positive *** Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.
1570 *** positive *** company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
1576 *** positive *** The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.
1574 *** positive *** I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
458 *** negative *** In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
1349 *** negative *** They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
1221 *** positive *** I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.
407 *** negative *** Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
1372 *** negative *** Â  We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.
1374 *** negative *** Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
400 *** positive *** The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
1379 *** negative *** Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.
1378 *** negative *** Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.
408 *** negative *** I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
9 *** positive *** The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)

395 *** negative *** The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
398 *** negative *** Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
2308 *** negative *** The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.
2301 *** negative *** when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
2303 *** positive *** the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
2305 *** negative *** the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
2307 *** positive *** The Toshiba Net book operates very well.
245 *** positive *** It is light and the battery last a very long time.

240 *** positive *** Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
248 *** negative *** The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.

2274 *** positive *** We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
2271 *** positive *** We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
2270 *** positive *** A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
2273 *** positive *** WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
2279 *** positive *** The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
2455 *** positive *** The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
2456 *** positive *** Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.
2451 *** positive *** Im glad that it has such great features in it.

1977 *** negative *** I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
2698 *** positive *** I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.
2697 *** negative *** I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
2696 *** negative *** I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.
2694 *** positive *** Peformance is good for the price.
2690 *** negative *** I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.
1604 *** positive *** I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.
1968 *** positive *** Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.
1969 *** positive *** I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.
1616 *** positive *** It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.

1614 *** positive *** I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
1612 *** positive *** The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
1613 *** positive *** Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
1962 *** negative *** It was heavy,bulky, and hard to carry because of the size.

1766 *** positive *** It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
1767 *** positive *** Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.
1764 *** positive *** It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.
1765 *** positive *** It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.
1140 *** negative *** Â  Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
1149 *** negative *** I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.
2966 *** negative *** The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
1545 *** positive *** I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

698 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.

542 *** negative *** power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
543 *** negative *** after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
540 *** negative *** The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect.
541 *** positive *** The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.
547 *** positive *** It has a faster processor and more ram.
544 *** positive *** I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.
761 *** negative *** With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.
411 *** negative *** Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.
1385 *** negative *** Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
1383 *** negative *** The right speaker did not work.

388 *** positive *** The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
259 *** negative *** They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
2196 *** positive *** The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary.
253 *** negative *** Another issue I have with it is the battery.

2208 *** positive *** I especially like the backlit keyboard.

2791 *** positive *** Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.
169 *** negative *** Not easy to carry.
160 *** positive *** They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.

1810 *** positive *** The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.
1812 *** positive *** The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
1818 *** positive *** This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.
1819 *** positive *** It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
1099 *** negative *** It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!
1601 *** negative *** I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and "fixed" the edges by rounding them off.
1600 *** positive *** Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
1602 *** positive *** If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.
1973 *** negative *** Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately.
1972 *** negative *** It was hard to handle and operate at school.

2843 *** positive *** I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!

1776 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
1771 *** positive *** It is easy to navigate and update programs.
1770 *** positive *** It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
1778 *** negative *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
1159 *** negative *** I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
1152 *** negative *** Then the hard drive failed;
1551 *** positive *** It is easy to use and lightweight.
1553 *** positive *** Great battery, speed, display.

2993 *** positive *** It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
3030 *** negative *** It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.

2996 *** negative *** I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
3034 *** negative *** :-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
533 *** negative *** I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!
532 *** positive *** All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.
3035 *** positive *** It works really well.
2992 *** negative *** Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
1558 *** positive *** The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
2994 *** negative *** The only downfall is the volume control.
3031 *** positive *** I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
536 *** negative *** I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
429 *** negative *** The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.
1399 *** negative *** the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
1398 *** positive *** although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.
1393 *** negative *** the mouse buttons are hard to push.
1392 *** negative *** sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
427 *** negative *** I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....

2181 *** negative *** Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.

2188 *** positive *** I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.
223 *** positive *** It just works flawlessly!

2212 *** positive *** The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.

2210 *** positive *** It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.
