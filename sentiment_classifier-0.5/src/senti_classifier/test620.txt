2853 *** negative *** It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
2854 *** negative *** Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
1491 *** positive *** The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.
1492 *** positive *** The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.
1493 *** positive *** ">  iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with: easy and convenient.
1495 *** positive *** The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.
1497 *** positive *** The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
1701 *** positive *** Comes with iMovie;
1625 *** positive *** I cannot be happier with the service or product.
1706 *** positive *** My main reason to convert was the imovie program.
1707 *** positive *** I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
1391 *** negative *** the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
1128 *** negative *** Keyboard could use some trimming.
1129 *** negative *** Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
1124 *** negative *** Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).
1126 *** negative *** The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
2988 *** positive *** It's a great product for a great price!
3027 *** negative *** Enabling the battery timer is useless.
3026 *** negative *** The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
2980 *** negative *** I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.
2987 *** positive *** It works fine with our wireless and they've had not problems.
3022 *** positive *** It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
3020 *** positive *** It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.
526 *** negative *** It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.
520 *** negative *** My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
523 *** positive *** I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
1015 *** negative *** The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.
1012 *** negative *** I had to pay for the shipping!
1237 *** negative *** The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!
435 *** negative *** They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
433 *** negative *** And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.
559 *** positive *** apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
555 *** positive *** It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
1960 *** positive *** All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.
3065 *** positive *** I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
3064 *** positive *** The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
997 *** negative *** Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
235 *** positive *** The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.
237 *** positive *** I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
2226 *** positive *** Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
2227 *** positive *** I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!
2225 *** positive *** I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
2223 *** negative *** The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
2220 *** positive *** The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
2221 *** positive *** Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
146 *** negative *** I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
147 *** negative *** The keyboard is too slick.
144 *** positive *** I thought the price was great for the specs.
145 *** negative *** But after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.
142 *** negative *** I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell (not to say Dell is that great), not with a brand new laptop.
140 *** negative *** I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.
2088 *** negative *** The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
2083 *** positive *** It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
2080 *** negative *** Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
2081 *** positive *** I love the multi-touch trackpad.
2086 *** negative *** My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
2084 *** positive *** If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.
2085 *** positive *** (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
2539 *** positive *** i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.
2532 *** negative *** The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
2531 *** positive *** Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
2534 *** positive *** But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
2713 *** positive *** The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
2710 *** positive *** Came fully loaded - good.
2711 *** positive *** Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
2718 *** negative *** I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.
2719 *** negative *** Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
1839 *** negative *** The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.
2155 *** positive *** The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you sowish.
2157 *** positive *** This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
2400 *** positive *** The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.
937 *** positive ***   I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.
936 *** positive ***   It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
2408 *** positive *** Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
2409 *** positive *** The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
1956 *** negative *** Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
1953 *** negative *** My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
1952 *** negative *** I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
1959 *** positive *** The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
1958 *** positive *** I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys.
824 *** negative ***   Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.
821 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
823 *** negative ***   It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
822 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
1483 *** positive *** The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
1481 *** positive *** It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.
1480 *** positive *** My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
1487 *** positive *** My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
1485 *** positive *** This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
1484 *** positive *** If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
1489 *** positive *** All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.
1488 *** positive *** There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.
1713 *** positive *** Love the speed, especially!
795 *** negative *** so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
1710 *** positive *** The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.
793 *** negative *** when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
792 *** negative *** The letter A stopped working after the first week.
799 *** negative *** then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
2415 *** positive *** The gray color was a good choice.
2414 *** negative *** The 17 inch screen is very large, but the computer is very light.
1139 *** negative ***   I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
1138 *** negative *** Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
2417 *** negative *** Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
1131 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
3018 *** positive *** The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
3019 *** positive *** The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
3011 *** positive *** Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
3016 *** positive *** I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.
3017 *** positive *** The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.
2797 *** negative *** Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
519 *** negative *** The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
2149 *** positive *** We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
2795 *** negative *** At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.
1001 *** negative *** But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
621 *** negative *** -Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
1224 *** negative *** I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
626 *** negative *** Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
625 *** negative *** No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because "many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset"-Inquired status of repair.
624 *** negative *** They claim call center is still down.
1228 *** negative *** The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
2880 *** negative *** So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.
2886 *** positive *** My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
2884 *** positive *** I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
13 *** positive *** The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
12 *** positive *** For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.
15 *** positive *** Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.
14 *** positive *** Not too much "junk" software to remove.
16 *** positive *** A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
19 *** positive *** Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
18 *** positive *** While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
205 *** positive *** Images are crisp and clean.
204 *** positive *** The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
207 *** positive *** Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
206 *** negative *** The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.
209 *** positive *** Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.
208 *** positive *** The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.
2239 *** positive *** After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
2238 *** negative *** and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
2231 *** positive *** you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
2233 *** positive *** u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.
2235 *** positive *** also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
2234 *** positive *** and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.
2236 *** positive *** also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
682 *** positive *** GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!
2095 *** positive *** I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
2097 *** positive *** For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
2096 *** positive *** The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
2091 *** negative *** One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.
2090 *** positive *** Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
2093 *** negative *** I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.
2524 *** positive *** It was secure and easy to navigate.
2526 *** positive *** Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
2529 *** negative *** Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.
2709 *** negative *** Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.
2708 *** negative *** The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.
2705 *** positive *** Registration/1st use is easy.
2704 *** positive *** Its a good laptop for its value.
2707 *** negative *** Would like more trendy, high tech features.
2706 *** negative *** Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
2701 *** positive *** Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.
1824 *** negative *** When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
2146 *** positive *** But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
2413 *** positive *** The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
2144 *** positive *** the speed is fine.
2143 *** positive *** Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.
2141 *** positive *** this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
926 *** negative *** But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
927 *** negative *** So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
1921 *** negative *** Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.
1922 *** negative *** The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
1923 *** negative *** Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
1924 *** negative *** In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
1925 *** negative *** When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.
832 *** negative ***   My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.
833 *** negative ***   Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
830 *** negative ***   There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
831 *** negative ***   The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
836 *** negative *** The AC power port becomes loose over time
834 *** positive *** This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
835 *** negative *** but it  has a major design flaw.
839 *** positive *** I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
3 *** positive *** It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.
784 *** negative *** If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
781 *** negative *** The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
1727 *** positive *** The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
1722 *** positive *** After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
1723 *** positive *** The performance is awesome.
62 *** negative *** They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.
3006 *** positive *** lots of preloaded software.
406 *** negative *** HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
1582 *** positive *** Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.
1580 *** positive *** A great computer for light home use and business use.
405 *** negative *** Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
1038 *** positive *** Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.
404 *** negative *** Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
508 *** negative *** Just a black screen!
403 *** negative *** First the screen goes completely out.
1030 *** negative *** Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
505 *** negative *** They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
1036 *** negative *** You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
1037 *** negative *** The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
1212 *** negative *** They say sorry out of warranty.
1213 *** negative *** Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
634 *** negative *** I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
1376 *** positive *** It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.
2898 *** positive *** The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.
2895 *** positive *** It's super fast and a great value for the price!
2894 *** positive *** The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
2890 *** positive *** LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
1454 *** negative ***   since then i have had minor problems with slow operation.
1455 *** negative ***   also the battery is completely shot.
1105 *** negative *** After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
1450 *** positive *** The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
1101 *** positive *** Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
1458 *** negative ***   the battery is irreplaceable.
1459 *** negative ***   i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
214 *** positive *** Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.
213 *** negative *** Speakers too small to be of any real use.
219 *** positive *** The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
4 *** positive *** I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :)
938 *** positive ***   Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.
2550 *** positive *** The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
2553 *** negative *** He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
2558 *** negative *** We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
3007 *** negative *** the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.
2395 *** positive *** It is easy to use, good quality and good price.
2392 *** positive *** Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
2393 *** positive *** I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
2398 *** positive *** I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;
2778 *** negative *** The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.
2775 *** positive *** Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.
2776 *** positive *** My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
2777 *** positive *** Great wifi too.
1858 *** negative *** The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
1856 *** negative *** They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
2170 *** positive *** Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
2171 *** positive *** I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
918 *** negative ***  THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
2174 *** positive *** Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
915 *** negative *** A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
914 *** negative ***  A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
917 *** negative ***  One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
913 *** negative ***  A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
2605 *** positive *** The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
2600 *** positive *** After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years, I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.
2602 *** positive *** Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
2603 *** positive *** I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.
1933 *** negative *** I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.
1937 *** negative *** I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
1936 *** negative *** In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
846 *** negative *** I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3  months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).
843 *** negative *** The "abuse" is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.
842 *** negative *** I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
848 *** positive *** How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.
1587 *** positive *** It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
2407 *** positive *** You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely cannot be without.
1739 *** positive *** Design: very durable.
1731 *** positive *** Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.
1730 *** positive *** Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.
1733 *** negative *** Games being the main issue.
1732 *** negative *** The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
1734 *** negative *** It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
1039 *** negative *** Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
753 *** negative *** Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
756 *** negative *** PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
755 *** negative *** Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
758 *** negative *** Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
1595 *** positive *** Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.

2956 *** positive *** It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.
1599 *** negative *** I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.
