1355 *** negative *** Runs Hot  I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.

191 *** negative *** 3) Horrible customer support
1106 *** negative *** It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.

2547 *** positive *** The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
1107 *** negative *** I was said it's videocard.
2549 *** positive *** Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
2548 *** positive *** The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
2381 *** negative *** still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.
2380 *** positive *** previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.

2385 *** positive *** I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
2387 *** positive *** Screen is awesome, battery life is good.
2386 *** negative *** I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
2388 *** positive *** Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
2762 *** positive *** The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
2761 *** positive *** It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.
2760 *** positive *** It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
2765 *** positive *** I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
902 *** negative *** 2 months later, the battery went.
903 *** negative *** They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
900 *** negative *** Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
907 *** negative *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
905 *** negative *** I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
1842 *** negative ***   The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
908 *** negative *** Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
1846 *** negative ***   Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
1845 *** negative ***   even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.
2168 *** positive *** There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.
2167 *** negative *** There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
2166 *** positive *** It runs perfectly.
2161 *** positive *** This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.
2160 *** positive *** Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
2617 *** positive *** It really is perfect for work and play.
2612 *** positive *** It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
2611 *** positive *** Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
2610 *** positive *** It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
2619 *** positive *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
1906 *** negative ***   Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
1902 *** negative ***   The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
854 *** negative ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
851 *** negative ***   I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
858 *** negative ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
859 *** negative *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
740 *** positive *** This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
741 *** positive *** Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.
744 *** negative *** The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
745 *** negative *** Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
746 *** negative *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
3062 *** positive *** The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.
2949 *** negative *** It discharges too quickly.
2948 *** negative *** The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
2947 *** positive *** wonderful features.
2946 *** positive *** Everything about this computer is easy to use.
2944 *** positive *** I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
2943 *** positive *** Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
2941 *** negative *** I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
2940 *** positive *** Runs smooth and quick.
1050 *** negative *** *=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.
1052 *** negative *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1053 *** negative *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
719 *** positive *** It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
1057 *** positive *** Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.
1696 *** positive *** The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.
1793 *** positive *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
1694 *** positive *** Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
1691 *** negative *** The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.
1698 *** negative *** MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
613 *** negative *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
610 *** positive *** lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
617 *** negative *** No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
614 *** negative *** -When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
712 *** positive *** I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
1795 *** negative *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1472 *** negative *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1470 *** negative *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1471 *** negative *** And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
1476 *** positive *** The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
1479 *** positive *** The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
496 *** negative *** Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
490 *** negative *** But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
25 *** positive *** Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
26 *** positive *** The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.
27 *** positive *** The ease of set up was terrific.
22 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
23 *** positive *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
29 *** negative *** I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
7 *** positive *** AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!
2288 *** positive *** Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
2578 *** negative *** Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
2574 *** positive *** I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
2575 *** negative *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
2572 *** positive *** Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
2571 *** positive *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
2378 *** positive *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2377 *** negative *** The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
2373 *** negative *** The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
2594 *** positive *** It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
2595 *** positive *** Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
2592 *** positive *** I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.
1085 *** negative *** WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
1874 *** negative *** I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
592 *** positive *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
1872 *** negative *** I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
1878 *** negative *** 1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1879 *** negative *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
973 *** positive *** With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
2111 *** negative *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
2117 *** negative *** When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
2622 *** positive *** Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
2620 *** negative *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
2621 *** positive *** I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
2626 *** positive *** The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
2627 *** positive *** It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
2624 *** positive *** The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
2625 *** positive *** The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
1911 *** negative ***   However the frozen screens kept happening.
1913 *** negative ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1912 *** negative ***   I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
2756 *** positive *** The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
2757 *** positive *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
2754 *** positive *** I recommend for word processing and internet users.
2755 *** positive *** I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
2752 *** positive *** I am using the external speaker- sound is good.
2753 *** positive *** Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
2022 *** negative *** It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
2751 *** positive *** Good monitor and performed well.
2759 *** positive *** This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!
884 *** negative *** Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
888 *** negative *** The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!
63 *** negative *** I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
775 *** negative *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
777 *** negative *** HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
771 *** negative *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
773 *** negative *** I'm tired of the inept service.
779 *** negative *** This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
76 *** positive *** I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
73 *** negative *** The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
3058 *** negative *** they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
70 *** positive *** It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
2973 *** positive *** It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.
3055 *** positive *** It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.
2976 *** negative *** They only stay charged a little over an hour.
2977 *** negative *** Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
2974 *** positive *** It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
2975 *** negative *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
1043 *** negative *** Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
1040 *** negative *** Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
1046 *** negative *** I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
1049 *** negative *** Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
1048 *** positive *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1682 *** positive *** As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
1684 *** positive *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
1686 *** positive *** Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
1689 *** positive *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1268 *** negative *** Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
668 *** positive *** the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
265 *** negative *** No tutorials on the display.
661 *** negative *** There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.
3021 *** negative *** For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
8 *** positive *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1467 *** negative *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
1316 *** negative *** The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
1315 *** negative *** It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
319 *** positive *** It is super easy to use.
312 *** positive *** The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
311 *** positive *** The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
310 *** positive *** I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
315 *** positive *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
314 *** positive *** I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
2020 *** negative *** I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
2021 *** negative *** This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
440 *** positive *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
1330 *** positive *** This is what I call a good after sales service.
1332 *** negative *** Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.
2299 *** positive *** You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
2292 *** positive *** The ease of use is wonderful.
2291 *** positive *** There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
2290 *** positive *** I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
2296 *** negative *** You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
2568 *** positive *** I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
2140 *** positive *** All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
2561 *** negative *** I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
2563 *** positive *** Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.
2565 *** positive *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2368 *** positive *** He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
2362 *** positive *** Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
2360 *** positive *** Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
2587 *** negative *** One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
659 *** positive *** I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.
2585 *** positive *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
1867 *** negative *** I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
1869 *** positive ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
961 *** negative ***   This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
969 *** negative *** The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
2101 *** positive *** Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.
2106 *** positive *** It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.
2105 *** positive *** It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
30 *** positive *** Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
2637 *** positive *** Delivery was early too.
2636 *** negative *** the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
2631 *** positive *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2632 *** positive *** I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
878 *** negative *** The tech store I purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.
879 *** positive *** and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
871 *** negative *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
2741 *** negative *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
2034 *** negative *** I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
2745 *** positive *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
2032 *** negative *** The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.
2747 *** positive *** Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
2030 *** negative *** None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
2749 *** positive *** Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
2748 *** positive *** Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.
890 *** negative *** Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
899 *** positive *** The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
1964 *** negative *** This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.
1966 *** negative *** It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
768 *** negative *** This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
2961 *** negative *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
2960 *** positive *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
2963 *** positive *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
2962 *** negative *** This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
762 *** negative *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
763 *** negative *** Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
1783 *** positive *** It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
2969 *** positive *** The laptop was very easy to set up.
3049 *** negative *** Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).
3048 *** negative *** I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
1610 *** positive *** My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
3045 *** negative *** Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.
3047 *** negative *** (Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
1078 *** positive *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1076 *** negative *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
1075 *** negative *** It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
1072 *** positive *** Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
1070 *** negative *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
1071 *** positive *** I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
1674 *** positive *** All for such a great price.
1675 *** positive *** It's color is even cool.
1676 *** positive *** Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
1097 *** negative ***  I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
678 *** positive *** and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
675 *** positive *** 10 plus hours of battery...
676 *** positive *** super fast processor and really nice graphics card..
670 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
671 *** positive *** This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
1418 *** negative ***   Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
1419 *** negative ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
1410 *** negative *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1411 *** negative *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1412 *** negative *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
1413 *** negative *** Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
1414 *** negative *** The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
1417 *** negative ***   The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
1322 *** negative *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
1327 *** negative *** But the arm velcro is torn after one use.
1329 *** positive *** The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
1524 *** positive *** If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
1254 *** negative *** After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).
1252 *** negative *** Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
1529 *** positive *** A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
1258 *** negative *** It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.
1259 *** positive *** Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
308 *** negative *** On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
309 *** positive *** Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
