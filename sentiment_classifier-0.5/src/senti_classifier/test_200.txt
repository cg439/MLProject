1984 *** positive *** Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.
1633 *** positive *** As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
2839 *** negative *** the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.

451 *** positive *** It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
452 *** positive *** (I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.

3082 *** negative *** This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;

569 *** positive *** But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
326 *** positive *** I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
327 *** positive *** Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.
329 *** negative *** I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).

2482 *** positive *** We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
2481 *** positive *** It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC's.

2460 *** positive *** It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.

1295 *** negative *** As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
2792 *** negative *** The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
2063 *** negative *** Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
2796 *** negative *** This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
2065 *** negative *** After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
2067 *** positive *** I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.
2666 *** negative *** The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
2660 *** negative *** The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.
1748 *** negative *** Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.
2668 *** negative *** The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
2669 *** negative *** Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
2938 *** negative *** I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.
2939 *** positive *** This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
2936 *** positive *** Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
2937 *** positive *** I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
2934 *** positive *** The internet speed is spectacular.
2935 *** negative *** The battery life is probably an hour at best.
2932 *** negative *** To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
2933 *** positive *** The graphics are great.
1647 *** positive *** And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
1646 *** positive *** But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
1641 *** negative *** I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
1649 *** positive *** And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
1648 *** positive *** And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
578 *** positive *** The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
572 *** positive *** 10 hours of battery life is really something else....
571 *** positive *** very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
577 *** positive *** It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
2808 *** negative *** Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
2809 *** negative *** I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.
2806 *** negative *** the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.
2807 *** negative *** the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
2805 *** negative *** little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
1420 *** negative *** Â Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
1423 *** negative *** My problem was with DELL Customer Service.
1425 *** negative *** In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
1427 *** positive *** BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
1426 *** positive *** I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
733 *** negative *** Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
732 *** negative *** Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
735 *** negative *** I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.
1358 *** negative *** Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
469 *** negative *** I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.
1351 *** negative *** I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
2153 *** positive *** The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
1357 *** negative *** After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.
460 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
462 *** negative *** Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
2159 *** positive *** The battery life is also relatively good.
1511 *** positive *** There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
357 *** positive *** Keyboard is reasonable size.

354 *** negative *** The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
353 *** negative *** From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.
350 *** negative *** also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
359 *** negative *** Charger seems large for this class of computer.
2323 *** positive *** I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use.
2322 *** positive *** The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.
2320 *** positive *** I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.
1444 *** negative *** Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.
280 *** negative *** Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.
285 *** negative *** It doesnt work worth a damn.
286 *** negative *** The display is beyond horrible.
260 *** negative *** oh yeah, and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed?
264 *** negative *** Vista is a nightmare.
2491 *** positive *** First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
2490 *** negative *** 2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into
2492 *** positive *** Amazing Quality!
2495 *** negative *** The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
2494 *** positive *** The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!
2496 *** negative *** Mac is not made for gaming.
2258 *** positive *** , Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).

2477 *** positive *** I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.
988 *** negative *** Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.
2471 *** positive *** Suffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.
2470 *** positive *** Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.
983 *** positive *** Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
980 *** negative *** Â     First it burned or fused the power adapter plug.
986 *** negative *** the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement/repair of parts.
984 *** negative *** This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
2478 *** positive *** All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler, quicker, and easier.
115 *** negative *** The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.
116 *** positive *** Despite the inconvenient weight, I opted for the 12 cell battery.
113 *** negative *** In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.
112 *** negative *** The screen gets smeary and dusty very quickly and it's very noticeable.
2785 *** negative *** Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
2784 *** negative *** It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.
2787 *** positive *** Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.
2781 *** negative *** The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.
2780 *** negative *** There is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer.
2783 *** negative *** Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
2782 *** negative *** while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.
2789 *** positive *** Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.
2073 *** negative *** Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
2070 *** negative *** Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
2077 *** positive *** The screen shows great colors.
2076 *** positive *** It's fast and has excellent battery life.
2075 *** positive *** I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.

2672 *** positive *** The price is great for this model, I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room.
2675 *** negative *** I had static in the output, and I had to reduce the sound output quality to "FM" as opposed to the default "CD.
2674 *** negative *** One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB.
2677 *** negative *** As with any laptop not purchased with software options, it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications.
2676 *** negative *** " This isn't a big deal, I haven't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media, only through USB output.
2679 *** negative *** Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.
2928 *** positive *** That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.
2923 *** positive *** The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.
2922 *** positive *** I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.
2926 *** negative *** The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
1986 *** negative *** I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.
1987 *** negative *** The cover for the DVD drive soon came off, too--a mark of poor construction quality.
1632 *** negative *** Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!
1985 *** negative *** From the get-go, the M6809 was unsteady in its operation;
1983 *** positive *** At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.
1638 *** positive *** The battery life is great.
1639 *** positive *** The software is amazing.
1989 *** negative *** Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer, so I had to remove it.

2819 *** negative *** Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.
566 *** positive *** pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.
1189 *** negative *** Now for the hardware problems.
1186 *** negative *** And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no  forward delete  key.
1187 *** negative *** Another included program that is laughable is the chess game.
1184 *** negative *** ) And printing from either word processor is an adventure.
1182 *** negative *** They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
722 *** positive *** Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.
1744 *** positive *** Supplied software: The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with.
1745 *** negative *** Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.
1746 *** positive *** Screen, keyboard, and mouse: If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen, responsive island backlit keyboard, and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.
1747 *** negative *** Downfalls: sharp edges.
1740 *** positive *** The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.
1163 *** negative *** After numerous calls to Applecare tech support, I was directed to send in my computer;
2913 *** positive *** Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment.

44 *** negative *** I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
43 *** negative *** It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.
41 *** negative *** Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.

1564 *** positive *** The display is awesome.
1565 *** positive *** The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market.
1566 *** negative *** Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
1567 *** positive *** But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
1201 *** negative *** Once again, I was told it was the suspicious  power supply  problem.
1364 *** negative *** Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
1365 *** negative *** Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.
474 *** negative *** Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.
1361 *** negative *** Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.
