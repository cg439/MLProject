1723 *** The performance is awesome.
1704 *** I pondered very long over this decision.
1091 *** This thing sucks!
2942 *** I Love my new computer!
702 *** Okay, let's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy.
483 *** It was a Waste of money from day one!
2198 *** I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.
1957 *** So I got another netbook which I love!
2118 *** But in fact it is totally the opposite.
286 *** The display is beyond horrible.
513 *** He LEFT ME, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......
3029 *** It's a joke.
1411 *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1956 *** Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
1918 *** I started hainv problems with it within the first month.
1469 *** Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
2833 *** the laptop preformed pretty well.
118 *** I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!
2325 *** But I don't see it as a problem.
754 *** Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP.
3050 *** I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed.
3015 *** This one has had the same effect.
2829 *** And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.
674 *** This computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!
1217 *** So buyer beware when buying Toshiba
933 ***   I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!
298 *** I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.
442 *** I love the Apple products.
1447 *** I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.
1810 *** The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.
2191 *** I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay, they are in no way comparable to the Mac.
1419 ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
1250 *** They're absolutely useless, unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall.
2832 *** was a great deal i will give that.
1660 *** Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
1848 ***   His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.
459 *** After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
1144 ***   Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?  Probably not ever again.
2513 *** I have used PC's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.
2884 *** I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
2082 *** If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.
629 *** -Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.
2847 *** It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.
1391 *** the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
56 *** I am sorry that I purchased this laptop.
2257 *** Awesome graphics!
2617 *** It really is perfect for work and play.
2653 *** The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).
1763 *** I am a college student and it has been very useful.
1760 *** The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.
1275 *** My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best.
2674 *** One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB.
519 *** The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
57 *** I needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only reason I didn't purchase a Mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs.
1534 *** I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.
2514 *** If you have the money I suggest going for the i7.
105 *** That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
3065 *** I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
2520 *** It is, however, very heavy.
2057 *** Was disappointed to find out that the model had been discontinued, apparently because of known motherboard problems.
251 *** Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
2073 *** Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
2890 *** LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
180 *** But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
508 *** Just a black screen!
320 *** All you have to do is turn it on and it works.
2352 *** A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.
1923 *** Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
1279 *** Recently there are a few incidents that annoy the hell out of me.
2921 *** Save your money and go for a better device.
1705 *** I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.
2631 *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2903 *** without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.
2851 *** My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
2741 *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
398 *** Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
1750 *** I ordered four D620 laptops.
329 *** I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).
587 *** I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down
2069 *** I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
2081 *** I love the multi-touch trackpad.
2040 *** I was psyched.
553 *** I absolutely love my mac!
2546 *** From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!
406 *** HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
2852 *** It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
14 *** Not too much "junk" software to remove.
1076 *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
2395 *** It is easy to use, good quality and good price.
1562 *** The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it!
2425 *** It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
2786 *** The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.
2724 *** Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.
385 *** It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.
2079 *** If I have a few hundred dollars to spare, I'd buy the Pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model.
854 ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
2116 *** But enough about that, I am an Apple convert for life.
390 *** I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!
2405 *** But, Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy.
253 *** Another issue I have with it is the battery.
1700 *** HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.
1278 *** Now I know!
881 *** After 2 months of complaints, Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.
1188 *** Even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its  queen every time.
486 *** That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.
1487 *** My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
2508 *** PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote.
864 *** I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.
2571 *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
1435 *** It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.
2748 *** Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.
350 *** also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
303 *** Take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.
1306 *** It is as good as new.
489 *** And it didn't show up on the reciept, I don't know how we ordered it online!
2162 *** I went from BestBuy to Dell, Windows to Apple.
481 *** Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name.
1925 *** When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.
2749 *** Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
623 *** *3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam.
1167 *** They don't seem to be susceptible to viruses, which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers.
1897 ***   I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.
769 *** Asked the customer service rep.
3046 *** So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.
2190 *** I cannot even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer.
2685 *** Basic computer.
1971 *** I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all.
726 *** It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart.
289 *** I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
1855 ***   I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.
2803 *** I should have bought one a long time ago.
2017 *** I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.
1133 *** I got what I paid for.
1596 *** Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.
2736 *** Needs Power and Mouse Cable to Plug in back instead of side, In the way of operating a mouse in small area.
1916 ***   However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.
1919 *** I got the first "Blue screen of death" in the early part of July.
1047 *** -4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
762 *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
113 *** In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.
2533 *** It seems to be incompatible with everything else.
2836 *** the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.
962 ***   When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!
1459 ***   i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
2188 *** I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.
2274 *** We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
1343 *** But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.
1002 *** It was returned on the third day I owned it.
1699 *** IT WANT TAKE IT, IT KEEP SAYING ERROR.
1941 *** Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort, I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.
2303 *** the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
2910 *** Highly recommend for daily use.
77 *** We are addicted to the Mac.
1314 *** Because it IS a defective product.
2499 *** Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
2868 *** True quality at a great price!
169 *** Not easy to carry.
2409 *** The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
1119 *** I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review.
1322 *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
1740 *** The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.
2014 *** It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.
2239 *** After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
367 *** I am ADDICTED to photo booth!
335 *** The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.
1328 *** So, I went back.
2652 *** I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.
1384 *** I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.
2831 *** All in all great item highly recommend it.
3042 *** Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.
2263 *** This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!
1481 *** It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.
2769 *** I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time.
2491 *** First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
1648 *** And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
236 *** Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.
1869 ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
2763 *** I don't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it's perfect for me.
1264 *** Guess I'll stay away from HP.
2882 *** It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!
955 *** It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!
750 *** There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.
1653 *** And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop.
1466 *** But then, something goes wrong.
2810 *** So far so good with this laptop.
1457 ***   i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
1165 *** Avoid this model.
763 *** Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
1977 *** I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
1945 *** The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer  usually even the trouble some Toshiba satellite.
939 *** it has had some problems.
1243 *** Theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.
1387 *** This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.
2156 *** Of course, for a student, weight is always an issue.
626 *** Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
3056 *** The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
1879 *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
1806 *** This little netboook is helping me get work done!
2121 *** They also use two totally different operating systems.
