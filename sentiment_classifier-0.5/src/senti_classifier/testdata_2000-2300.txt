887 *** I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.
2039 *** I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
3032 *** This ain't it.
2107 *** I wasn't really as concerned about portability (it's a very large laptop) but it's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise.
907 *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
160 *** They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.
254 *** Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
2926 *** The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
1632 *** Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!
710 *** Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.
1271 *** I should have kept my big, old HP.
2142 *** everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.
348 *** i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
703 *** I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.
1377 *** You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.
2562 *** You just get a trial version either way.
992 *** I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.
2167 *** There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
2635 *** great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.
2932 *** To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
2904 *** I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.
850 *** I never have had a good result with this computer.
440 *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
1882 *** YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.
2671 *** while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.
1031 *** NO more Lenovo for me.
414 *** I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.
1286 *** However, a NETBOOK will be a different story.
2092 *** I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.
1812 *** The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
2599 *** I am a full Mac convert now.
573 *** I highly recommend that you buy this product.
1198 *** Though you get a polite person, you often don t get a solution.
639 *** -I propose that I can just swap the hard drives.
1272 *** It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.
2311 *** The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
2725 *** Sound card is limited though.
1147 *** I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.
671 *** This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
725 *** After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.
175 *** So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.
2580 *** But let me tell you, the mac book pro is so professional.
831 ***   The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
1816 *** go for it!
2269 *** I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.
111 *** The keyboard, which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard, now looks terrible.
1564 *** The display is awesome.
1166 *** After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route.
6 *** The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.
98 *** It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
656 *** However, this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it.
2396 *** Perfect trifecta!
2584 *** The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard.
492 *** It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!
613 *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
637 *** -I propose that they can just swap the hard drives.
663 *** So don't get it.
2163 *** it was a tough choice.
1061 *** Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
943 ***   They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new.
1662 *** The Awesomest of the awesomest.
2179 *** One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).
574 *** I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.
2309 *** I'm glad it waited, this one is great.
1226 *** I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.
1169 *** (For those old enough to remember, it is similar to Beta versus VHS.
2627 *** It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
2743 *** But, I would recommend this product.
1980 *** I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.
1802 *** If so, you may be having similar problems.
885 *** Some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.
1537 *** This is a great machine!
3059 *** This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops.
2558 *** We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
1026 *** So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
2694 *** Peformance is good for the price.
1228 *** The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
376 *** I can see why the have soooo much money.
776 *** I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.
1232 *** And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
755 *** Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
1640 *** And in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.
1947 *** I had 3 months when the ports started going out.
2841 *** think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.
3017 *** The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.
1836 *** I'll wait and save up for a new one.
3069 *** This laptop does everything I need it to very well.
2441 *** They are not.
2604 *** It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze, and organizing them by place, time taken, or sending them to an online print shop, or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc, is not hard at all.
437 *** Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
3003 *** I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.
319 *** It is super easy to use.
1406 *** Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.
22 *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
2576 *** I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.
1775 *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
382 *** It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs, but now that I have, I can't see myself going back to it.
538 *** They discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.
2279 *** The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
20 *** LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!
2917 *** The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.
550 *** The speakers on it are useless too.
883 *** You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.
1004 *** This is not Best Buy's fault.
2068 *** I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).
1405 *** Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.
590 *** I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!
3076 *** Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.
2403 *** Exactly that, users.
1768 *** Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.
2651 *** I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.
565 *** they will not let you down.
94 *** Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current, up to date HP Pavilion--If I recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.
1044 *** It's not a recommendation, it' a plea.
1936 *** In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
2859 *** Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.
2745 *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
616 *** -When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.
2489 *** I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.
736 *** got another 1, and same issue.
2203 *** Thank you Best Buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software - you guys were GREAT too!
2986 *** They were able to set-up with labtops themselves within a few minutes.
3063 *** I consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need.
1053 *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
593 *** After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.
354 *** The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
65 *** I would never buy a Dell again.
2010 ***   Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
950 ***   The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
2761 *** It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.
822 ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
771 *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
1642 *** I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!
577 *** It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
2247 *** iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.
1523 *** They don't crash.
2267 *** As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;
252 *** This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
683 *** I love this little one.
1932 *** So not having my laptop was discouraging.
601 *** I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
945 ***   Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.
2160 *** Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
1501 *** It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.
1333 *** 1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.
2222 *** I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
2254 *** Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops, it is worth the price.
290 *** I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.
1467 *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
856 ***   I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.
608 *** can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
1335 *** However, this will be my last as well.
255 *** There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
1305 *** SO? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT? C'mon, I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.
395 *** The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
1815 *** If you're looking for a great laptop, you've found the best here.
1104 *** The first programm I switched on was a game for my children.
2922 *** I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.
1821 *** I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.
689 *** I've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it's all about.
1200 *** On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.
2398 *** I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;
2581 *** Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.
2361 *** Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!
487 *** It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting.
801 *** Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
1766 *** It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
2236 *** also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
323 *** But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.
1518 *** The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .
1965 *** I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.
294 *** The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.
2136 *** i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.
646 *** they respond: "your dissatisfaction is noted"...
28 *** I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.
1717 *** ( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
2766 *** I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
448 *** Also the display is exceptional!
2681 *** This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old.
1225 *** The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.
2277 *** This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used.
1077 *** (3DMARK6 score is only 8500).
2885 *** I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.
2287 *** So honestly, I wasn't expecting anything less than perfection, and I wasn't disappointed.
207 *** Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
1664 *** My friends are in awe every time they come over!
2805 *** little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
1819 *** It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
3013 *** The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.
904 *** THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
1624 *** 2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection.
2093 *** I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.
890 *** Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
722 *** Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.
3066 *** I normally dont participate in reviews/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...
2432 *** Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.
575 *** I work in film editing and post production, so I need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.
1629 *** I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the "blue screen of death".
898 *** At first when I got this product, I loved it.
281 *** I think this computer is super lame.
494 *** It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted, but I didn't realize at the time it would be such a monster!
1310 *** Even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.
1570 *** company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
1020 *** I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
1559 *** THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.
982 ***   Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.
2983 *** I purchased two laptops (for my husband and 16 year old daughter).
528 *** More relieved than anything.
1783 *** It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
2090 *** Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
545 *** Summary: Spend your money elsewhere
564 *** believe me apple has a reputation.
597 *** The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
454 *** The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
1321 *** The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.
2507 *** PC users work in Word, while Mac users work in Pages.
370 *** I am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.
84 *** While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.
2058 *** I've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago
742 *** The perfect notebook...
834 *** This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
1449 *** The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.
576 *** My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.
566 *** pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.
598 *** I highly recommend this product!
983 *** Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
1421 *** So far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the HP I replaced.
2975 *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
2684 *** Good price.
918 ***  THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
1628 *** I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.
2144 *** the speed is fine.
1298 *** I was starting to boil.
1361 *** Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.
748 *** BAck she goes!
2784 *** It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.
794 *** not the day received.
1805 *** Good for every day computing and web browsing.
2597 *** While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.
821 ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
1027 *** It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.
1737 *** It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made.
364 *** If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it!
441 *** Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.
1913 ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1793 *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
378 *** I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.
1412 *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
304 *** I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.
473 *** Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.
2678 *** Took a while to clean it up to my specs.
1677 *** They are so realistic I am just speechless.
2963 *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
568 *** This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, I find not much difference except of course for the screen size.
1202 *** But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.
1829 *** There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.
1944 *** They have more problems then a 1980's computer.
1579 *** It is amazing.
1220 *** Needless to say, not to happy with the product.
1679 *** The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
1463 *** My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.
339 *** Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.
562 *** the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it.
1491 *** The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.
1171 *** I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
1727 *** The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
181 *** I would  say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
2503 *** Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.
3031 *** I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
1516 *** The Macbooks worth every penny.
2970 *** I did not have to call the support line at all.
1483 *** The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
1084 *** THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.
120 *** The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.
1658 *** Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
3004 *** I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.
2894 *** The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
1448 *** But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.
1716 *** There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can't be used with the iBook.
2734 *** Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba.
257 *** Don't waste your money!
176 *** Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
632 *** -Managed to send complaint email.
1755 *** however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.
686 *** Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell
2315 *** OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.
2609 *** I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.
1290 *** I thought it would be a simple job.
1567 *** But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
52 *** I Hate it!
1111 *** Don't buy this model.
387 *** The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.
2175 *** I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.
8 *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1832 *** I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.
403 *** First the screen goes completely out.
2350 *** I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
2078 *** I love this 13" Mac white unibody.
346 *** the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!
1881 *** When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC.
