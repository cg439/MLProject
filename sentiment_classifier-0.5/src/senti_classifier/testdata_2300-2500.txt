1497 *** The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
498 *** And inconvenient!
280 *** Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.
2312 *** It is so speedy.
402 *** Needs constant repair.
127 *** I will never purchase a HP again ever.
1012 *** I had to pay for the shipping!
657 *** It bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.

2764 *** I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops.
2324 *** One bad thing is it gets hot.
2720 *** I'm stuck w/ a broken computer.
2149 *** We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
1475 *** Hope this helps!
926 *** But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
682 *** GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!
516 *** Apparently they're not special anymore .
871 *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
691 *** I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!
841 *** 99 to  fix it.
1702 *** Few viruses to catch;
1744 *** Supplied software: The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with.
423 *** Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
773 *** I'm tired of the inept service.
1659 *** Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
746 *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
2475 *** While many people brag about Mac being "intuitive", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.
1358 *** Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
108 *** It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
1818 *** This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.
2253 *** If you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.
1112 *** Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
1576 *** The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.
2467 *** Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.
491 *** We didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!
1409 *** But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.
458 *** In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
1530 *** Its also FUN to use!
1612 *** The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
2273 *** WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
2824 *** Simple to use, and great graphics.
2519 *** It still serves me well both in business and home needs.
2045 *** I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!
1725 *** My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.
2934 *** The internet speed is spectacular.
624 *** They claim call center is still down.
2408 *** Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
428 *** If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.
2883 *** I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!
221 *** You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
1557 *** My house is now 100% Macbook.
1246 *** They're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.
2984 *** My husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.
819 ***   I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
2565 *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2120 *** My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.
1554 *** It WORKS!
1339 *** You just lose a customer.
1199 *** I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.
909 *** Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
2347 *** Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around.
1470 *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1601 *** I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and "fixed" the edges by rounding them off.
499 *** I hate it!
1210 *** returned it.
1747 *** Downfalls: sharp edges.
2920 *** It is a cheap throw together.
2537 *** i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.
2606 *** I would recommend Mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.
2322 *** The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.
1129 *** Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
2218 *** Can't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me.
239 *** Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!
941 *** I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
1154 *** So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
1201 *** Once again, I was told it was the suspicious  power supply  problem.
2158 *** It easily fits into most computer bags but doesn't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and/or textbooks.
1558 *** The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
2601 *** It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact, and I am certainly glad I did.
462 *** Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
2248 *** In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.
1097 ***  I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
148 *** I really don't like it, but I am stuck.
1308 *** The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the "repair".
838 *** The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.
649 *** -Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.
2528 *** Once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts.
2477 *** I love the feel of the key board, as well as the trackpad.
2226 *** Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
1994 *** These new problems were the final straws;
1453 ***   luckly i had a student task force able to help, or else it would have crashed within the first year.
1181 *** That seemed to solve the problem, till I wrote an article with semicolons in it.
670 *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
1051 *** -Touchpad will take a bit of time to get used to.
2554 *** We both recently got new laptops.
1578 *** I've been a PC user and I just finally switched and I am never going back.
2560 *** I got the Macbook and he got a Macbook Pro.
2326 *** Winters is on it's way and I imagine it will be cozy.
2892 *** I bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop.
1216 *** Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
2152 *** Will certainly use MacConnection again.
1074 *** But, buy this model and just purchase 4GB of RAM (2x2GB for $92 or 1x4GB for $99), and save yourself $100 than the other model with 8GB of RAM.
268 *** this is one of the reasons I purchased it.
159 *** Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3.
1293 *** She told me flatly, "It's like that one.
2401 *** If you're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive game, you'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market.
585 *** It is the easiest computer I have ever used
421 *** So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?
1684 *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
627 *** Should be there by the end of the week (again...).
2680 *** Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
1401 *** so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
693 *** I just got this laptop for college, and so far I am very happy with it.
3008 *** tosiba has a good reputation, my llast computer was an acer.
1803 *** My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well.
1140 ***   Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
2143 *** Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.
1778 *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
1769 *** The internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily.
2447 *** Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
477 *** They transfer you around to other people who do not understand what you are saying and you can't understand what they are saying.
2390 *** Speakers don't get that loud, but good enough.
1134 *** I have had it 9 months and it is already a $250 loss.
1676 *** Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
1866 ***   I was WRONG!
27 *** The ease of set up was terrific.
2619 *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
31 *** Screen is crystal clear, yes it's small - but it's a netbook!
317 *** So this review might be a tad bit bias.
480 *** This was around three years, maybe four years ago.
2935 *** The battery life is probably an hour at best.
1369 *** This is a review of windows vista system.
1533 *** She said its very user friendly.
2950 *** Kind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.
3057 *** cosmetically, the only thing they changed was 2 of the Function keys at the top.
1536 *** I am very happy I bought this Mac, well worth the extra money.
1001 *** But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
830 ***   There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
2164 *** After looking at all the pros and cons, I decided on the Macbook Pro.
2913 *** Screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment.
32 *** First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
328 *** Hope this helped!
1626 *** I used to build my own desktops from the component parts, and recently my 7 year old Pentium 4 with HT 1 GB ram SATA desktop stopped working (this was a rock star 7 years ago).
2067 *** I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.

482 *** I had my computer custom built from Sonystyle.com.
1187 *** Another included program that is laughable is the chess game.
711 *** Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.
2846 *** It works great for general internet use, Microsoft Office apps, home bookkeeping, etc.
1970 *** I will not buy another one.
1422 *** Time will tell.
2873 *** The price was very good, and the product is top quality.
679 *** This computer is really fast and I'm shocked as to how easy it is to get used to...

2295 *** One of the wonderful things about Macs is that they are virus free.

1540 *** It even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well.

2407 *** You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely cannot be without.
2827 *** This computer I used daily nice compact design.
2960 *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
965 *** I practically have a new laptop with all the "fixes" they have done!
1631 *** Finally, I purchased a Toshiba.
1972 *** It was hard to handle and operate at school.
1345 *** You may just lose 1 customer for now.
2867 *** It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.
592 *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
