2393 *** I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
1261 *** But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.
2837 *** the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
1442 *** Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.
2547 *** The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
1070 *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
21 *** Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
99 *** After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
1480 *** My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
3078 *** the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
707 *** I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.
897 *** Enjoy your sitdown
2009 ***   The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
963 ***   Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.
86 *** I have had my new Macbook Pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled ALL of my old PC laptops.
1645 *** See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.
2792 *** The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
2575 *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
571 *** very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
2011 ***   The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
2161 *** This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.
3080 *** I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.
1464 *** At first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.
2446 *** I didn't want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice.
2542 *** i can use it for all of my needs.
2262 *** After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.
2583 *** the screen brightness automatically adjusts.
2208 *** I especially like the backlit keyboard.
1118 *** Either way I'm furious.
2526 *** Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
396 *** My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.
2088 *** The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
2061 *** I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.
1094 *** This computer was bought because I wanted "top of the line", fast, reliable, HA.
501 *** A lot of help they WEREN'T!
1799 *** (The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
1013 *** I will never buy anything from HP again!
1521 *** I can't imagine EVER buying a PC again!
1052 *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1922 *** The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
2251 *** It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click.
2715 *** Took it back as it was defective.
1115 *** Other Thoughts: I love newegg, I recommend them to the world however this is just unacceptable.
1214 *** Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
297 *** I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.
1025 *** I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.
2990 *** Right size and weight for portability.
2555 *** We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.
2384 *** So far, so good!
2929 *** It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
1262 *** Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.
701 *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
828 ***   It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.
2411 *** What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC!
3023 *** The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.
2961 *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
133 *** This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix.
1162 *** UPDATE: Two years after buying this laptop, I am now the proud owner of a lemon.
2329 *** While it was highly rated, would I like it? I tried the keyboard at the store, and it seemed ok.
2000 *** Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
2204 *** I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.
1269 *** We did not even have it a year.
1528 *** I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
928 *** So you out of of notebook and money.
772 *** Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.
1502 *** But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.
858 ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
1173 *** (No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
1647 *** And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
2488 *** The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
1995 *** I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
2820 *** Fast, great visual!
2083 *** It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
1060 *** You will need them if you want to reload the OS (I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal).
261 *** apple and quess what, you have to send the whole laptop in, too bad, so sad
3038 *** If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.
1814 *** might have to buy one for me now, since I use it all the time.
2782 *** while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.
468 *** I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling.
1092 *** I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian) After on Hour mine was at 53% life left and his was at 69% life left.
1280 *** The latest is on my LG Netbook X12
1478 *** Purchased as a gift for a friend.
1235 *** I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.
1773 *** I've never had problems with viruses.
1854 *** After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.
1511 *** There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
563 *** the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds.
2668 *** The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
1535 *** However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
2991 *** Battery life needs more life.
132 *** For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
1011 *** I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
466 *** I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!
208 *** The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.
2314 *** Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
2552 *** My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $300 less (he got a pc).
634 *** I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
1926 *** Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.
880 *** I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.
721 *** both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.
2849 *** I have owned it only two months!
360 *** I love my macbook pro!
1572 *** From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy.
247 *** I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it.
2417 *** Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
1715 *** Thanks, MacConnection, for making this a seamless purchase!
500 *** We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.
859 *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
1504 *** It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
2474 *** The difference is phenomenal.
158 *** I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.
2421 *** I am a freelance graphic artist.
2567 *** No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).
1961 *** I did not like my acer.
2879 *** My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days.
946 ***   Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school.
1565 *** The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market.
2854 *** Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
2585 *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
2692 *** Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
1146 ***   Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.
413 *** I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.
2634 *** The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
2232 *** mac is extremely different than any other laptop.
3018 *** The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
49 *** In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
2614 *** It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.
981 ***   I should have realized that trouble was brewing .
259 *** They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
2774 *** Thank you.
2256 *** The benefits were immediate!
1550 *** Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.
1721 *** Never any doubt I would get a MacBook, just wasn't sure which one.
2146 *** But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
1399 *** the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
2400 *** The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.
1917 *** I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008.
1302 *** I guess he was the technical person.
2815 *** They click.
534 *** A seventy dollar mouse!
429 *** The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.
978 *** I have the A65 - right now it's a paperweight.
2301 *** when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
2087 *** That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.
2378 *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2722 *** I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.
1058 *** But when I received my replacement, I made BOTH recovery DVDs (4), and a driver/application DVD.
2252 *** In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.
2781 *** The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.
927 *** So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
2293 *** What's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision.
424 *** The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
2316 *** PDF files can be viewed instantly.
2008 *** Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.
1726 *** I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.
2779 *** Overall for the money this is a good deal.
2955 *** It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
2697 *** I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
1575 *** I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait.
1007 *** I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
979 ***    It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous.
2357 *** I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.
1087 *** EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.
2529 *** Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.
2111 *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
71 *** I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest.
1619 *** I love the Mac so much better than my work PC!
400 *** The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
2628 *** I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.
2212 *** The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.
2153 *** The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
212 *** Small and light weight.
443 *** Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.
511 *** He didn't work for sony, he was just approved to fix their crappy products.
194 *** 4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
2620 *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
1593 *** Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since "learning how to use it".
83 *** Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.
1299 *** Of course, I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others.
366 *** Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.
2686 *** Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
368 *** It is SO much fun to play with.
784 *** If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
647 *** *6th week*-They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit...
1496 *** All of the programs (Keynote, Pages, Numbers) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible, which really eliminates the need for the actual.
2602 *** Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
1450 *** The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
1410 *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
688 *** And Toshiba is a quality supplier.
2097 *** For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
527 *** I can't honestly say I was heartbroken.
2665 *** WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU
1795 *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
2230 *** and finally i realized that mac is the best.
114 *** It's very annoying.
2224 *** I'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.
3033 *** My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.
1614 *** I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
1003 *** I'm Very disappointed in Dell.
1392 *** sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
680 *** I've only had mine a day but I'm already used to it...
436 *** And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.
697 *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
1159 *** I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
2757 *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
232 *** For me, five stars is not enough.
2122 *** I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products.
1508 *** Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.
278 *** The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
2783 *** Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
327 *** Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.
2731 *** The first one sent: Touchpad didn't work The second sent: USB didn't work The third sent: Touchpad didn't work The fourth sent: Hasn't arrived yet.
218 *** I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.
5 *** This is definitely a computer worth the money;
1749 *** Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.
820 ***   I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
245 *** It is light and the battery last a very long time.
1979 *** Better stick with another brand.
202 *** I am glad I did my research.
1142 ***   And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
1211 *** 5 months dead again.
2294 *** Also, you won't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus.
1583 *** Very happy.
2372 *** The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.
1438 *** Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.
1949 *** My children won't even use it  for their school work.
2663 *** THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.
952 *** The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
1858 *** The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
2235 *** also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
2825 *** It has everything I would need for a home computer.
514 *** The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....
1048 *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1729 *** I love this computer.
1904 ***   They informed me that I had around 7 "policies" or viruses on it.
1182 *** They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.
2455 *** The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
1213 *** Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
1394 *** i cant believe HP put this out.
1924 *** In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
2268 *** without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.
2171 *** I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
790 *** I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
552 *** Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
1859 *** Otherwise, I love it!
2589 *** Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.
2643 *** I have recently converted back to a mac and I couldn't be happier!
733 *** Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
870 *** At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.
1910 ***   They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.
2029 *** I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.
2242 *** The graphics are stunning.
2085 *** (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
543 *** after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
925 *** You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.
724 *** It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on.
2139 *** this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.
1771 *** It is easy to navigate and update programs.
383 *** The laptop is gorgeous.
2355 *** It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.
2200 *** I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.
723 *** I've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i don't regret buying it.
2043 *** HP didn't fix it.
2258 *** , Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).
1960 *** All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.
2006 *** Now, I guess, I'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor, hapless soul.
2223 *** The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
23 *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
2711 *** Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
1899 ***   The problems started with just the screen freezing.
495 *** Taking it anywhere was a pain!
1606 *** I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot.
1018 *** I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.
1761 *** I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years.
554 *** I can't imagine my life without it anymore!
2728 *** defective software.
1964 *** This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.
2808 *** Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
775 *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
2424 *** It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz.
1689 *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1894 *** I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.
1078 *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1492 *** The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.
808 *** 3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.
1472 *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1038 *** Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.
818 *** I would recommend not buying this product.
861 *** its more like a snail crawl.
544 *** I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.
1959 *** The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
315 *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
2573 *** I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.
1996 *** I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
509 *** So I called, AGAIN.
