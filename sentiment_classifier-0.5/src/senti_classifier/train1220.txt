344 *** negative *** It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
347 *** negative *** pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
340 *** positive *** They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
348 *** positive *** i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
349 *** positive *** i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
2318 *** positive *** Wonderful zooming.
2314 *** positive *** Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
2315 *** positive *** OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.
2311 *** positive *** The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
296 *** positive *** Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
295 *** positive *** The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
293 *** negative *** Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
291 *** negative *** Not to mention it has shit gigs.
271 *** negative *** MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.
273 *** negative *** Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
274 *** negative *** The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.
275 *** negative *** It is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.
277 *** negative *** The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used, and the command prompt would not work at all.
278 *** negative *** The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
279 *** negative *** The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.
2260 *** positive *** The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
2261 *** positive *** The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!
2266 *** negative *** As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
2267 *** positive *** As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;
2443 *** positive *** Boots up fast and runs great!
2447 *** positive *** Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
2448 *** positive *** The pictures are clear as can be.
108 *** negative *** It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
109 *** negative *** Then it ceased charging at all.
102 *** positive *** The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
103 *** negative *** The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.
101 *** positive *** I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
107 *** negative *** My laptop now has no battery.
105 *** negative *** That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
2047 *** negative *** I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.
2049 *** negative *** It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
2689 *** negative *** I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
2684 *** positive *** Good price.
2686 *** negative *** Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
2680 *** positive *** Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
2682 *** negative *** Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
99 *** negative *** After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
98 *** negative *** It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
91 *** negative *** Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
90 *** negative *** The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
92 *** negative *** The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
97 *** negative *** First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
1623 *** negative *** With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
1993 *** negative *** Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
1620 *** negative *** I will never go back to Windows!
1995 *** negative *** I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
1997 *** negative *** it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.
2860 *** positive *** But, for the cost this is a winner.
2863 *** positive *** The price and features more than met my needs.
2864 *** positive *** I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.
2865 *** positive *** The feature are good enough for what I need.
2867 *** positive *** It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.
2868 *** positive *** True quality at a great price!
550 *** negative *** The speakers on it are useless too.
552 *** negative *** Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
1191 *** positive *** Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
1190 *** negative *** Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.
1193 *** negative *** Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.
1192 *** negative *** The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
1197 *** negative *** Finally, the biggest problem has been tech support.
1196 *** negative *** The Apple will run Internet Explorer, but at an amazingly slow rate.
1758 *** negative *** The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
1757 *** positive *** Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
1175 *** positive *** The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2
1173 *** positive *** (No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
1172 *** positive *** I ordered through MacMall, which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.
1171 *** positive *** I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
1179 *** negative *** First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
1284 *** negative *** Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
1288 *** negative *** We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.
1573 *** positive *** It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
684 *** positive *** The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.
687 *** positive *** Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.
1570 *** positive *** company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
1576 *** positive *** The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.
1574 *** positive *** I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
458 *** negative *** In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
1349 *** negative *** They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
1221 *** positive *** I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.
407 *** negative *** Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
1372 *** negative ***   We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.
1374 *** negative *** Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
400 *** positive *** The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
1379 *** negative *** Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.
1378 *** negative *** Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.
408 *** negative *** I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
9 *** positive *** The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)
1018 *** positive *** I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.

395 *** negative *** The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
398 *** negative *** Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
2308 *** negative *** The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.
2301 *** negative *** when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
2303 *** positive *** the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
2305 *** negative *** the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
2307 *** positive *** The Toshiba Net book operates very well.
245 *** positive *** It is light and the battery last a very long time.

240 *** positive *** Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
248 *** negative *** The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.

2274 *** positive *** We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
2271 *** positive *** We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
2270 *** positive *** A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
2273 *** positive *** WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
2279 *** positive *** The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
2455 *** positive *** The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
2456 *** positive *** Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.
2451 *** positive *** Im glad that it has such great features in it.
2453 *** positive *** Clear picture on it and everything.

171 *** negative *** The battery gets so HOT it is scary.

1977 *** negative *** I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
2698 *** positive *** I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.
2697 *** negative *** I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
2696 *** negative *** I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.
2694 *** positive *** Peformance is good for the price.
2690 *** negative *** I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.
1604 *** positive *** I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.
1968 *** positive *** Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.
1969 *** positive *** I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.
1616 *** positive *** It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
1617 *** positive *** The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
1614 *** positive *** I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
1612 *** positive *** The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
1613 *** positive *** Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
1962 *** negative *** It was heavy,bulky, and hard to carry because of the size.

1766 *** positive *** It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
1767 *** positive *** Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.
1764 *** positive *** It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.
1765 *** positive *** It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.
1140 *** negative ***   Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
1149 *** negative *** I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.
2966 *** negative *** The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
1545 *** positive *** I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

698 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.

542 *** negative *** power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
543 *** negative *** after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
540 *** negative *** The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect.
541 *** positive *** The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.
547 *** positive *** It has a faster processor and more ram.
544 *** positive *** I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.
761 *** negative *** With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.
411 *** negative *** Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.
1385 *** negative *** Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
1383 *** negative *** The right speaker did not work.

388 *** positive *** The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
259 *** negative *** They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
2196 *** positive *** The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary.
253 *** negative *** Another issue I have with it is the battery.

2208 *** positive *** I especially like the backlit keyboard.
2426 *** positive *** I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.
2791 *** positive *** Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.
169 *** negative *** Not easy to carry.
160 *** positive *** They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.
161 *** negative *** For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
162 *** positive *** / awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen...

2738 *** positive *** Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.
1817 *** positive *** Great value, fast delivery- Computer works as if brand new, no problems, very pleased
1810 *** positive *** The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.
1812 *** positive *** The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
1818 *** positive *** This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.
1819 *** positive *** It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
1099 *** negative *** It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!
1601 *** negative *** I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and "fixed" the edges by rounding them off.
1600 *** positive *** Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
1602 *** positive *** If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.
1973 *** negative *** Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately.
1972 *** negative *** It was hard to handle and operate at school.

2845 *** positive *** I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.
2843 *** positive *** I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!

1776 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
1771 *** positive *** It is easy to navigate and update programs.
1770 *** positive *** It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
1778 *** negative *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
1159 *** negative *** I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
1152 *** negative *** Then the hard drive failed;
1551 *** positive *** It is easy to use and lightweight.
1553 *** positive *** Great battery, speed, display.

2993 *** positive *** It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
3030 *** negative *** It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.

2996 *** negative *** I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
3034 *** negative *** :-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
533 *** negative *** I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!
532 *** positive *** All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.
3035 *** positive *** It works really well.
2992 *** negative *** Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
1558 *** positive *** The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
2994 *** negative *** The only downfall is the volume control.
3031 *** positive *** I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
536 *** negative *** I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
429 *** negative *** The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.
1399 *** negative *** the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
1398 *** positive *** although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.
1393 *** negative *** the mouse buttons are hard to push.
1392 *** negative *** sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
427 *** negative *** I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....

2181 *** negative *** Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.

2188 *** positive *** I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.
223 *** positive *** It just works flawlessly!
220 *** negative *** Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
2213 *** positive *** I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.
2212 *** positive *** The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.

2210 *** positive *** It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.

2506 *** positive *** I was originally concerned that I couldn't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting, but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.
2505 *** positive *** and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online.
2503 *** positive *** Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.
2501 *** positive *** The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac.
2500 *** positive *** I was taught to use Photoshop and was amazed.
2727 *** negative *** Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.
2725 *** negative *** Sound card is limited though.
2723 *** positive *** Graphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.
2722 *** positive *** I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.
2728 *** negative *** defective software.
1805 *** positive *** Good for every day computing and web browsing.
1804 *** positive *** While Apple's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products, and their support is great, it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.
1803 *** negative *** My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well.
1256 *** negative *** Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.
1948 *** negative *** You can't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with.
1942 *** negative *** The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me, they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me.
1947 *** negative *** I had 3 months when the ports started going out.
810 *** negative *** YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.

2859 *** negative *** Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.
2858 *** positive *** Like the price and operation.
2851 *** negative *** My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
2853 *** negative *** It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
2854 *** negative *** Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
1491 *** positive *** The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.
1492 *** positive *** The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.
1493 *** positive *** ">  iPhoto is probably the best program I have ever worked with: easy and convenient.
1495 *** positive *** The Mac version of Microsoft Office is cheaper than buying the actual and works just as well.
1497 *** positive *** The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.
1701 *** positive *** Comes with iMovie;
1625 *** positive *** I cannot be happier with the service or product.
1706 *** positive *** My main reason to convert was the imovie program.
1707 *** positive *** I love this program, it is superior to windows movie maker.
1391 *** negative *** the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
1128 *** negative *** Keyboard could use some trimming.
1129 *** negative *** Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?
1124 *** negative *** Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).
1126 *** negative *** The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
2988 *** positive *** It's a great product for a great price!
3027 *** negative *** Enabling the battery timer is useless.
3026 *** negative *** The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.
2980 *** negative *** I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.
2987 *** positive *** It works fine with our wireless and they've had not problems.
3022 *** positive *** It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
3020 *** positive *** It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.
526 *** negative *** It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.
520 *** negative *** My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
523 *** positive *** I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
1015 *** negative *** The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.
1012 *** negative *** I had to pay for the shipping!
1237 *** negative *** The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!
435 *** negative *** They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
433 *** negative *** And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.
559 *** positive *** apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
555 *** positive *** It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
1960 *** positive *** All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.
3065 *** positive *** I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
3064 *** positive *** The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
997 *** negative *** Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
235 *** positive *** The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.
237 *** positive *** I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
2226 *** positive *** Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
2227 *** positive *** I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!
2225 *** positive *** I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
2223 *** negative *** The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
2220 *** positive *** The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
2221 *** positive *** Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
146 *** negative *** I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
147 *** negative *** The keyboard is too slick.
144 *** positive *** I thought the price was great for the specs.
145 *** negative *** But after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.
142 *** negative *** I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell (not to say Dell is that great), not with a brand new laptop.
140 *** negative *** I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.
2088 *** negative *** The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
2083 *** positive *** It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
2080 *** negative *** Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
2081 *** positive *** I love the multi-touch trackpad.
2086 *** negative *** My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
2084 *** positive *** If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.
2085 *** positive *** (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
2539 *** positive *** i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.
2532 *** negative *** The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
2531 *** positive *** Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
2534 *** positive *** But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
2713 *** positive *** The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
2710 *** positive *** Came fully loaded - good.
2711 *** positive *** Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
2718 *** negative *** I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.
2719 *** negative *** Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
1839 *** negative *** The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.
2155 *** positive *** The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you sowish.
2157 *** positive *** This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
2400 *** positive *** The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.
937 *** positive ***   I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.
936 *** positive ***   It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
2408 *** positive *** Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
2409 *** positive *** The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
1956 *** negative *** Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
1953 *** negative *** My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
1952 *** negative *** I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
1959 *** positive *** The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
1958 *** positive *** I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys.
824 *** negative ***   Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.
821 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
823 *** negative ***   It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
822 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
1483 *** positive *** The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
1481 *** positive *** It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.
1480 *** positive *** My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
1487 *** positive *** My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
1485 *** positive *** This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
1484 *** positive *** If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
1489 *** positive *** All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.
1488 *** positive *** There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.
1713 *** positive *** Love the speed, especially!
795 *** negative *** so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
1710 *** positive *** The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.
793 *** negative *** when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
792 *** negative *** The letter A stopped working after the first week.
799 *** negative *** then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
2415 *** positive *** The gray color was a good choice.
2414 *** negative *** The 17 inch screen is very large, but the computer is very light.
1139 *** negative ***   I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
1138 *** negative *** Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
2417 *** negative *** Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
1131 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
3018 *** positive *** The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
3019 *** positive *** The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
3011 *** positive *** Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
3016 *** positive *** I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.
3017 *** positive *** The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.
2797 *** negative *** Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
519 *** negative *** The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
2149 *** positive *** We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
2795 *** negative *** At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.
1001 *** negative *** But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
621 *** negative *** -Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
1224 *** negative *** I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
626 *** negative *** Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
625 *** negative *** No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because "many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset"-Inquired status of repair.
624 *** negative *** They claim call center is still down.
1228 *** negative *** The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
2880 *** negative *** So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.
2886 *** positive *** My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
2884 *** positive *** I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
13 *** positive *** The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
12 *** positive *** For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.
15 *** positive *** Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.
14 *** positive *** Not too much "junk" software to remove.
16 *** positive *** A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
19 *** positive *** Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
18 *** positive *** While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
205 *** positive *** Images are crisp and clean.
204 *** positive *** The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
207 *** positive *** Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.
206 *** negative *** The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.
209 *** positive *** Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.
208 *** positive *** The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.
2239 *** positive *** After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
2238 *** negative *** and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
2231 *** positive *** you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
2233 *** positive *** u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.
2235 *** positive *** also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
2234 *** positive *** and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.
2236 *** positive *** also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
682 *** positive *** GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!
2095 *** positive *** I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
2097 *** positive *** For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
2096 *** positive *** The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
2091 *** negative *** One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.
2090 *** positive *** Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
2093 *** negative *** I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.
2524 *** positive *** It was secure and easy to navigate.
2526 *** positive *** Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
2529 *** negative *** Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.
2709 *** negative *** Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.
2708 *** negative *** The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.
2705 *** positive *** Registration/1st use is easy.
2704 *** positive *** Its a good laptop for its value.
2707 *** negative *** Would like more trendy, high tech features.
2706 *** negative *** Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
2701 *** positive *** Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.
1824 *** negative *** When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
2146 *** positive *** But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
2413 *** positive *** The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
2144 *** positive *** the speed is fine.
2143 *** positive *** Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.
2141 *** positive *** this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
926 *** negative *** But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
927 *** negative *** So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
1921 *** negative *** Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.
1922 *** negative *** The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
1923 *** negative *** Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
1924 *** negative *** In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
1925 *** negative *** When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.
832 *** negative ***   My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.
833 *** negative ***   Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
830 *** negative ***   There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
831 *** negative ***   The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
836 *** negative *** The AC power port becomes loose over time
834 *** positive *** This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
835 *** negative *** but it  has a major design flaw.
839 *** positive *** I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
3 *** positive *** It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.
784 *** negative *** If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
781 *** negative *** The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
1727 *** positive *** The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
1722 *** positive *** After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
1723 *** positive *** The performance is awesome.
62 *** negative *** They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.
3006 *** positive *** lots of preloaded software.
406 *** negative *** HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
1582 *** positive *** Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.
1580 *** positive *** A great computer for light home use and business use.
405 *** negative *** Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
1038 *** positive *** Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.
404 *** negative *** Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
508 *** negative *** Just a black screen!
403 *** negative *** First the screen goes completely out.
1030 *** negative *** Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
505 *** negative *** They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
1036 *** negative *** You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
1037 *** negative *** The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
1212 *** negative *** They say sorry out of warranty.
1213 *** negative *** Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
634 *** negative *** I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
1376 *** positive *** It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.
2898 *** positive *** The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.
2895 *** positive *** It's super fast and a great value for the price!
2894 *** positive *** The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
2890 *** positive *** LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
1454 *** negative ***   since then i have had minor problems with slow operation.
1455 *** negative ***   also the battery is completely shot.
1105 *** negative *** After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
1450 *** positive *** The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
1101 *** positive *** Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
1458 *** negative ***   the battery is irreplaceable.
1459 *** negative ***   i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
214 *** positive *** Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.
213 *** negative *** Speakers too small to be of any real use.
219 *** positive *** The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
4 *** positive *** I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :)
938 *** positive ***   Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.
2550 *** positive *** The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
2553 *** negative *** He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
2558 *** negative *** We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
3007 *** negative *** the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.
2395 *** positive *** It is easy to use, good quality and good price.
2392 *** positive *** Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
2393 *** positive *** I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
2398 *** positive *** I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;
2778 *** negative *** The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.
2775 *** positive *** Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.
2776 *** positive *** My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
2777 *** positive *** Great wifi too.
1858 *** negative *** The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
1856 *** negative *** They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
2170 *** positive *** Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
2171 *** positive *** I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
918 *** negative ***  THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
2174 *** positive *** Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
915 *** negative *** A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
914 *** negative ***  A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
917 *** negative ***  One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
913 *** negative ***  A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
2605 *** positive *** The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
2600 *** positive *** After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years, I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.
2602 *** positive *** Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
2603 *** positive *** I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.
1933 *** negative *** I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.
1937 *** negative *** I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
1936 *** negative *** In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
846 *** negative *** I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3  months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).
843 *** negative *** The "abuse" is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.
842 *** negative *** I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
848 *** positive *** How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.
1587 *** positive *** It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
2407 *** positive *** You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely cannot be without.
1739 *** positive *** Design: very durable.
1731 *** positive *** Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.
1730 *** positive *** Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.
1733 *** negative *** Games being the main issue.
1732 *** negative *** The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
1734 *** negative *** It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
1039 *** negative *** Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
753 *** negative *** Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
756 *** negative *** PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
755 *** negative *** Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
758 *** negative *** Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
1595 *** positive *** Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.
3073 *** positive *** The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
1591 *** positive *** Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.
2959 *** positive *** The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.
3077 *** positive *** For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
3078 *** positive *** the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
2955 *** positive *** It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
2956 *** positive *** It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.
1599 *** negative *** I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.
1598 *** positive *** I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.
2952 *** negative *** There are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.
2953 *** negative *** The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.
1026 *** negative *** So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
1021 *** negative *** This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
1020 *** negative *** I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
1022 *** negative *** As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.
1028 *** negative *** Or the cursor would show up some place else.
503 *** negative *** I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.
607 *** negative *** tons of bloatware and junk programs.
1208 *** negative *** in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1204 *** negative *** After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.
1206 *** negative *** But to be honest, the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.
609 *** negative *** keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
608 *** negative *** can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
1202 *** negative *** But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.
1216 *** negative *** Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
1447 *** negative *** I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.
1446 *** negative *** When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
1113 *** negative *** Not even safe mode boots.
1112 *** negative *** Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
1440 *** positive *** My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.
1449 *** negative *** The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.
2005 *** positive *** it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.
1355 *** negative *** Runs Hot  I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.
488 *** negative *** But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.
194 *** negative *** 4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
191 *** negative *** 3) Horrible customer support
1106 *** negative *** It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
2541 *** negative *** the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.
2540 *** positive *** the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
2547 *** positive *** The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
1107 *** negative *** I was said it's videocard.
2549 *** positive *** Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
2548 *** positive *** The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
2381 *** negative *** still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.
2380 *** positive *** previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.
1457 *** negative ***   i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
2385 *** positive *** I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
2387 *** positive *** Screen is awesome, battery life is good.
2386 *** negative *** I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
2388 *** positive *** Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
2762 *** positive *** The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
2761 *** positive *** It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.
2760 *** positive *** It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
2765 *** positive *** I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
902 *** negative *** 2 months later, the battery went.
903 *** negative *** They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
900 *** negative *** Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
907 *** negative *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
905 *** negative *** I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
1842 *** negative ***   The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
908 *** negative *** Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
1846 *** negative ***   Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
1845 *** negative ***   even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.
2168 *** positive *** There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.
2167 *** negative *** There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
2166 *** positive *** It runs perfectly.
2161 *** positive *** This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.
2160 *** positive *** Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
2617 *** positive *** It really is perfect for work and play.
2612 *** positive *** It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
2611 *** positive *** Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
2610 *** positive *** It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
2619 *** positive *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
1906 *** negative ***   Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
1902 *** negative ***   The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
854 *** negative ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
851 *** negative ***   I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
858 *** negative ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
859 *** negative *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
740 *** positive *** This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
741 *** positive *** Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.
744 *** negative *** The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
745 *** negative *** Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
746 *** negative *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
3062 *** positive *** The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.
2949 *** negative *** It discharges too quickly.
2948 *** negative *** The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
2947 *** positive *** wonderful features.
2946 *** positive *** Everything about this computer is easy to use.
2944 *** positive *** I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
2943 *** positive *** Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
2941 *** negative *** I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
2940 *** positive *** Runs smooth and quick.
1050 *** negative *** *=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.
1052 *** negative *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1053 *** negative *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
719 *** positive *** It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
1057 *** positive *** Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.
1696 *** positive *** The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.
1793 *** positive *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
1694 *** positive *** Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
1691 *** negative *** The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.
1698 *** negative *** MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
613 *** negative *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
610 *** positive *** lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
617 *** negative *** No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
614 *** negative *** -When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
712 *** positive *** I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
1795 *** negative *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1472 *** negative *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1470 *** negative *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1471 *** negative *** And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
1476 *** positive *** The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
1479 *** positive *** The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
496 *** negative *** Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
490 *** negative *** But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
25 *** positive *** Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
26 *** positive *** The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.
27 *** positive *** The ease of set up was terrific.
22 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
23 *** positive *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
29 *** negative *** I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
7 *** positive *** AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!
2288 *** positive *** Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
2578 *** negative *** Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
2574 *** positive *** I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
2575 *** negative *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
2572 *** positive *** Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
2571 *** positive *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
2378 *** positive *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2377 *** negative *** The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
2373 *** negative *** The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
2594 *** positive *** It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
2595 *** positive *** Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
2592 *** positive *** I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.
1085 *** negative *** WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
1874 *** negative *** I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
592 *** positive *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
1872 *** negative *** I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
1878 *** negative *** 1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1879 *** negative *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
973 *** positive *** With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
2111 *** negative *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
2117 *** negative *** When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
2622 *** positive *** Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
2620 *** negative *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
2621 *** positive *** I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
2626 *** positive *** The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
2627 *** positive *** It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
2624 *** positive *** The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
2625 *** positive *** The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
1911 *** negative ***   However the frozen screens kept happening.
1913 *** negative ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1912 *** negative ***   I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
2756 *** positive *** The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
2757 *** positive *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
2754 *** positive *** I recommend for word processing and internet users.
2755 *** positive *** I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
2752 *** positive *** I am using the external speaker- sound is good.
2753 *** positive *** Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
2022 *** negative *** It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
2751 *** positive *** Good monitor and performed well.
2759 *** positive *** This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!
884 *** negative *** Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
888 *** negative *** The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!
63 *** negative *** I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
775 *** negative *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
777 *** negative *** HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
771 *** negative *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
773 *** negative *** I'm tired of the inept service.
779 *** negative *** This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
76 *** positive *** I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
73 *** negative *** The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
3058 *** negative *** they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
70 *** positive *** It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
2973 *** positive *** It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.
3055 *** positive *** It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.
2976 *** negative *** They only stay charged a little over an hour.
2977 *** negative *** Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
2974 *** positive *** It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
2975 *** negative *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
1043 *** negative *** Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
1040 *** negative *** Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
1046 *** negative *** I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
1049 *** negative *** Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
1048 *** positive *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1682 *** positive *** As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
1684 *** positive *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
1686 *** positive *** Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
1689 *** positive *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1268 *** negative *** Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
668 *** positive *** the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
265 *** negative *** No tutorials on the display.
661 *** negative *** There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.
3021 *** negative *** For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
8 *** positive *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1467 *** negative *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
1316 *** negative *** The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
1315 *** negative *** It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
319 *** positive *** It is super easy to use.
312 *** positive *** The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
311 *** positive *** The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
310 *** positive *** I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
315 *** positive *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
314 *** positive *** I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
2020 *** negative *** I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
2021 *** negative *** This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
440 *** positive *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
1330 *** positive *** This is what I call a good after sales service.
1332 *** negative *** Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.
2299 *** positive *** You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
2292 *** positive *** The ease of use is wonderful.
2291 *** positive *** There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
2290 *** positive *** I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
2296 *** negative *** You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
2568 *** positive *** I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
2140 *** positive *** All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
2561 *** negative *** I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
2563 *** positive *** Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.
2565 *** positive *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2368 *** positive *** He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
2362 *** positive *** Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
2360 *** positive *** Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
2587 *** negative *** One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
659 *** positive *** I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.
2585 *** positive *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
1867 *** negative *** I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
1869 *** positive ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
961 *** negative ***   This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
969 *** negative *** The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
2101 *** positive *** Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.
2106 *** positive *** It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.

2105 *** positive *** It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
30 *** positive *** Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
2637 *** positive *** Delivery was early too.
2636 *** negative *** the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
2631 *** positive *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2632 *** positive *** I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
878 *** negative *** The tech store I purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.
879 *** positive *** and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
871 *** negative *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
2741 *** negative *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
2034 *** negative *** I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
2745 *** positive *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.

1966 *** negative *** It did not have all the features I expected it to have.

2961 *** negative *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
2960 *** positive *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
2963 *** positive *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
2962 *** negative *** This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
762 *** negative *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
763 *** negative *** Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.

2969 *** positive *** The laptop was very easy to set up.

1078 *** positive *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1076 *** negative *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
1075 *** negative *** It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
1072 *** positive *** Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
1070 *** negative *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
1071 *** positive *** I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.

1419 *** negative ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
1410 *** negative *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1411 *** negative *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1412 *** negative *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
1413 *** negative *** Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
1414 *** negative *** The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
1417 *** negative ***   The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
1322 *** negative *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".

1258 *** negative *** It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.
1259 *** positive *** Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
308 *** negative *** On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
309 *** positive *** Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
301 *** positive *** I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
302 *** positive *** I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.
2359 *** positive *** The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.

2133 *** positive *** But you must get the 15 inch.
2130 *** positive *** I also liked the glass screen.
950 *** positive ***   The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
953 *** negative ***   Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.
952 *** negative *** The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
956 *** negative ***   I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.
2649 *** positive *** The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.
2644 *** positive *** It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!
2645 *** positive *** I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.

2000 *** positive *** Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
2001 *** positive *** Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.
2004 *** positive *** If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
475 *** negative *** They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
2009 *** negative ***   The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
667 *** positive *** The battery is really long.
