2980 *** negative *** I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.
2987 *** positive *** It works fine with our wireless and they've had not problems.
3022 *** positive *** It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.
3020 *** positive *** It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.
526 *** negative *** It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.
520 *** negative *** My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
523 *** positive *** I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
1015 *** negative *** The Computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks.
1012 *** negative *** I had to pay for the shipping!
1237 *** negative *** The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it!
435 *** negative *** They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.
433 *** negative *** And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.
559 *** positive *** apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
555 *** positive *** It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!
1960 *** positive *** All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.
3065 *** positive *** I'ts nice to have the higher-end laptops, but this fits my budget and the features I need.
3064 *** positive *** The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.
997 *** negative *** Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
235 *** positive *** The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.
237 *** positive *** I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.
2226 *** positive *** Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!
2227 *** positive *** I also got the added bonus of a 30" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!
2225 *** positive *** I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
2223 *** negative *** The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
2220 *** positive *** The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
2221 *** positive *** Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.
146 *** negative *** I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.
147 *** negative *** The keyboard is too slick.
144 *** positive *** I thought the price was great for the specs.
145 *** negative *** But after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.
142 *** negative *** I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell (not to say Dell is that great), not with a brand new laptop.
140 *** negative *** I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.
2088 *** negative *** The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
2083 *** positive *** It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
2080 *** negative *** Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
2081 *** positive *** I love the multi-touch trackpad.
2086 *** negative *** My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
2084 *** positive *** If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.
2085 *** positive *** (I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
2539 *** positive *** i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.
2532 *** negative *** The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.
2531 *** positive *** Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
2534 *** positive *** But the machine is awesome and iLife is great and I love Snow Leopard X.
2713 *** positive *** The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
2710 *** positive *** Came fully loaded - good.
2711 *** positive *** Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.
2718 *** negative *** I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.
2719 *** negative *** Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
1839 *** negative *** The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.
2155 *** positive *** The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you sowish.
2157 *** positive *** This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
2400 *** positive *** The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.
937 *** positive ***   I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.
936 *** positive ***   It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
2408 *** positive *** Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.
2409 *** positive *** The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.
1956 *** negative *** Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!
1953 *** negative *** My Toshiba did not have sound on everything, just certain things.
1952 *** negative *** I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
1959 *** positive *** The feel of this is better than the Toshiba, too.
1958 *** positive *** I especially like the keyboard which has chiclet type keys.
824 *** negative ***   Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.
821 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
823 *** negative ***   It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.
822 *** negative ***   Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
1483 *** positive *** The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.
1481 *** positive *** It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.
1480 *** positive *** My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.
1487 *** positive *** My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.
1485 *** positive *** This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.
1484 *** positive *** If upgrade is possible to the full Windows 7, then I will truly be a very happy geek.
1489 *** positive *** All the programs are easy and straight forward on my MacBook Pro, it is clean and organized, which I always strive to be myself.
1488 *** positive *** There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.
1713 *** positive *** Love the speed, especially!
795 *** negative *** so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.
1710 *** positive *** The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.
793 *** negative *** when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
792 *** negative *** The letter A stopped working after the first week.
799 *** negative *** then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
2415 *** positive *** The gray color was a good choice.
2414 *** negative *** The 17 inch screen is very large, but the computer is very light.
1139 *** negative ***   I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
1138 *** negative *** Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.
2417 *** negative *** Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.
1131 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
3018 *** positive *** The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.
3019 *** positive *** The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.
3011 *** positive *** Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
3016 *** positive *** I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.
3017 *** positive *** The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.
2797 *** negative *** Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
519 *** negative *** The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
2149 *** positive *** We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.
2795 *** negative *** At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.
1001 *** negative *** But sadly the replacement froze-up while updating the BIOS again and shut down and would not turn back on.
621 *** negative *** -Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).
1224 *** negative *** I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.
626 *** negative *** Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.
625 *** negative *** No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because "many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset"-Inquired status of repair.
624 *** negative *** They claim call center is still down.
1228 *** negative *** The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
2880 *** negative *** So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.
2886 *** positive *** My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!
2884 *** positive *** I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
13 *** positive *** The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
12 *** positive *** For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.
15 *** positive *** Runs fast and the regular layout keyboard is so much better.
14 *** positive *** Not too much "junk" software to remove.
16 *** positive *** A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
19 *** positive *** Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.
18 *** positive *** While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
205 *** positive *** Images are crisp and clean.
204 *** positive *** The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
207 *** positive *** Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.

209 *** positive *** Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.
208 *** positive *** The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.
2239 *** positive *** After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
2238 *** negative *** and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.
2231 *** positive *** you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
2233 *** positive *** u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.
2235 *** positive *** also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
2234 *** positive *** and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.
2236 *** positive *** also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
682 *** positive *** GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!
2095 *** positive *** I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.
2097 *** positive *** For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
2096 *** positive *** The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
2091 *** negative *** One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.
2090 *** positive *** Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
2093 *** negative *** I love a "pc" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.
2524 *** positive *** It was secure and easy to navigate.
2526 *** positive *** Besides the great look, it is a great machine.
2529 *** negative *** Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.
2709 *** negative *** Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.
2708 *** negative *** The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.
2705 *** positive *** Registration/1st use is easy.
2704 *** positive *** Its a good laptop for its value.
2707 *** negative *** Would like more trendy, high tech features.
2706 *** negative *** Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
2701 *** positive *** Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.
1824 *** negative *** When you call tech support you were routed to someone who was in another country and did not know what they were doing.
2146 *** positive *** But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
2413 *** positive *** The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
2144 *** positive *** the speed is fine.
2143 *** positive *** Quality Display  I was surprised with the performance and quality of this HP Laptop.
2141 *** positive *** this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
926 *** negative *** But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.
927 *** negative *** So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
1921 *** negative *** Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.
1922 *** negative *** The battery life was supposed to be 6 hours, but even if I ran off the battery with the high effeciency setting the battery would only last me on average about 2.5 to 3 hours.
1923 *** negative *** Eventually my battery wouldn't charge, so unless I had it plugged in it wouldn't even power on.
1924 *** negative *** In November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
1925 *** negative *** When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.
832 *** negative ***   My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.
833 *** negative ***   Worse, for the price I could get a *netbook* that outperforms this machine.
830 *** negative ***   There's literally no way to make it sing with Vista.
831 *** negative ***   The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.
836 *** negative *** The AC power port becomes loose over time
834 *** positive *** This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
835 *** negative *** but it  has a major design flaw.
839 *** positive *** I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.
3 *** positive *** It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.
784 *** negative *** If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
781 *** negative *** The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
1727 *** positive *** The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.
1722 *** positive *** After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
1723 *** positive *** The performance is awesome.
62 *** negative *** They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.
3006 *** positive *** lots of preloaded software.
406 *** negative *** HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.
1582 *** positive *** Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.
1580 *** positive *** A great computer for light home use and business use.
405 *** negative *** Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
1038 *** positive *** Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.
404 *** negative *** Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
508 *** negative *** Just a black screen!
403 *** negative *** First the screen goes completely out.
1030 *** negative *** Also kinda loud when the fan was running.
505 *** negative *** They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!
1036 *** negative *** You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of network capability.
1037 *** negative *** The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.
1212 *** negative *** They say sorry out of warranty.
1213 *** negative *** Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
634 *** negative *** I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.
1376 *** positive *** It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.
2898 *** positive *** The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.
2895 *** positive *** It's super fast and a great value for the price!
2894 *** positive *** The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
2890 *** positive *** LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!
1454 *** negative ***   since then i have had minor problems with slow operation.
1455 *** negative ***   also the battery is completely shot.
1105 *** negative *** After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.
1450 *** positive *** The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price.
1101 *** positive *** Strengths:Well-shaped Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
1458 *** negative ***   the battery is irreplaceable.
1459 *** negative ***   i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.
214 *** positive *** Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.
213 *** negative *** Speakers too small to be of any real use.
219 *** positive *** The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.
4 *** positive *** I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :)
938 *** positive ***   Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.
2550 *** positive *** The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!
2553 *** negative *** He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
2558 *** negative *** We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.
3007 *** negative *** the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.
2395 *** positive *** It is easy to use, good quality and good price.
2392 *** positive *** Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.
2393 *** positive *** I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
2398 *** positive *** I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;
2778 *** negative *** The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.
2775 *** positive *** Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.
2776 *** positive *** My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
2777 *** positive *** Great wifi too.
1858 *** negative *** The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
1856 *** negative *** They really do have the worlds very worst repair service.
2170 *** positive *** Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.
2171 *** positive *** I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!
918 *** negative ***  THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
2174 *** positive *** Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
915 *** negative *** A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
914 *** negative ***  A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
917 *** negative ***  One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
913 *** negative ***  A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).
2605 *** positive *** The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
2600 *** positive *** After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years, I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.
2602 *** positive *** Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
2603 *** positive *** I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.
1933 *** negative *** I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.
1937 *** negative *** I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
1936 *** negative *** In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they "expedited" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a "Senior Tech".
846 *** negative *** I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3  months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).
843 *** negative *** The "abuse" is that I pushed the power plug in too hard.
842 *** negative *** I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
848 *** positive *** How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.
1587 *** positive *** It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.
2407 *** positive *** You can even run a parallels type program easily and run any leftover PC software that you absolutely cannot be without.
1739 *** positive *** Design: very durable.
1731 *** positive *** Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.
1730 *** positive *** Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done.
1733 *** negative *** Games being the main issue.
1732 *** negative *** The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
1734 *** negative *** It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
1039 *** negative *** Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
753 *** negative *** Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.
756 *** negative *** PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
755 *** negative *** Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.
758 *** negative *** Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
1595 *** positive *** Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.
3073 *** positive *** The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
1591 *** positive *** Strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed This device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers.
2959 *** positive *** The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.
3077 *** positive *** For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;
3078 *** positive *** the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
2955 *** positive *** It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
2956 *** positive *** It is well worth the money it cost, Very good investment.
1599 *** negative *** I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.
1598 *** positive *** I was a little weary at purchasing another 13" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.
2952 *** negative *** There are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.
2953 *** negative *** The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.
1026 *** negative *** So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
1021 *** negative *** This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.
1020 *** negative *** I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.
1022 *** negative *** As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.
1028 *** negative *** Or the cursor would show up some place else.
503 *** negative *** I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.
607 *** negative *** tons of bloatware and junk programs.
1208 *** negative *** in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1204 *** negative *** After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.
1206 *** negative *** But to be honest, the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.
609 *** negative *** keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
608 *** negative *** can't reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers.
1202 *** negative *** But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.
1216 *** negative *** Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.
1447 *** negative *** I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.
1446 *** negative *** When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.
1113 *** negative *** Not even safe mode boots.
1112 *** negative *** Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.
1440 *** positive *** My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.
1449 *** negative *** The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.
2005 *** positive *** it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.
1355 *** negative *** Runs Hot  I thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an Apple product.
488 *** negative *** But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.
194 *** negative *** 4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
191 *** negative *** 3) Horrible customer support
1106 *** negative *** It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
2541 *** negative *** the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.
2540 *** positive *** the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
2547 *** positive *** The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
1107 *** negative *** I was said it's videocard.
2549 *** positive *** Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
2548 *** positive *** The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
2381 *** negative *** still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.
2380 *** positive *** previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.
1457 *** negative ***   i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.
2385 *** positive *** I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
2387 *** positive *** Screen is awesome, battery life is good.
2386 *** negative *** I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.
2388 *** positive *** Really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints.
2762 *** positive *** The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.
2761 *** positive *** It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.
2760 *** positive *** It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
2765 *** positive *** I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
902 *** negative *** 2 months later, the battery went.
903 *** negative *** They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
900 *** negative *** Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
907 *** negative *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
905 *** negative *** I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
1842 *** negative ***   The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
908 *** negative *** Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
1846 *** negative ***   Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
1845 *** negative ***   even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.
2168 *** positive *** There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.
2167 *** negative *** There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.
2166 *** positive *** It runs perfectly.
2161 *** positive *** This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.
2160 *** positive *** Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
2617 *** positive *** It really is perfect for work and play.
2612 *** positive *** It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
2611 *** positive *** Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
2610 *** positive *** It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
2619 *** positive *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
1906 *** negative ***   Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
1902 *** negative ***   The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
854 *** negative ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
851 *** negative ***   I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
858 *** negative ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
859 *** negative *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
740 *** positive *** This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
741 *** positive *** Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.
744 *** negative *** The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
745 *** negative *** Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
746 *** negative *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
3062 *** positive *** The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.
2949 *** negative *** It discharges too quickly.
2948 *** negative *** The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
2947 *** positive *** wonderful features.
2946 *** positive *** Everything about this computer is easy to use.
2944 *** positive *** I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
2943 *** positive *** Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.
2941 *** negative *** I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
2940 *** positive *** Runs smooth and quick.
1050 *** negative *** *=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.
1052 *** negative *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1053 *** negative *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
719 *** positive *** It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
1057 *** positive *** Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.
1696 *** positive *** The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.
1793 *** positive *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
1694 *** positive *** Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
1691 *** negative *** The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.
1698 *** negative *** MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
613 *** negative *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
610 *** positive *** lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
617 *** negative *** No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
614 *** negative *** -When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
712 *** positive *** I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
1795 *** negative *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1472 *** negative *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1470 *** negative *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1471 *** negative *** And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
1476 *** positive *** The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
1479 *** positive *** The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
496 *** negative *** Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
490 *** negative *** But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
25 *** positive *** Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
26 *** positive *** The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.
27 *** positive *** The ease of set up was terrific.
22 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
23 *** positive *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
29 *** negative *** I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
7 *** positive *** AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!
2288 *** positive *** Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
2578 *** negative *** Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
2574 *** positive *** I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
2575 *** negative *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
2572 *** positive *** Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
2571 *** positive *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
2378 *** positive *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2377 *** negative *** The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
2373 *** negative *** The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
2594 *** positive *** It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
2595 *** positive *** Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
2592 *** positive *** I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.
1085 *** negative *** WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
1874 *** negative *** I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
592 *** positive *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
1872 *** negative *** I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
1878 *** negative *** 1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1879 *** negative *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
973 *** positive *** With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
2111 *** negative *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
2117 *** negative *** When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
2622 *** positive *** Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
2620 *** negative *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
2621 *** positive *** I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
2626 *** positive *** The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
2627 *** positive *** It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
2624 *** positive *** The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
2625 *** positive *** The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
1911 *** negative ***   However the frozen screens kept happening.
1913 *** negative ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1912 *** negative ***   I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
2756 *** positive *** The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
2757 *** positive *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
2754 *** positive *** I recommend for word processing and internet users.
2755 *** positive *** I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
2752 *** positive *** I am using the external speaker- sound is good.
2753 *** positive *** Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
2022 *** negative *** It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
2751 *** positive *** Good monitor and performed well.
2759 *** positive *** This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!
884 *** negative *** Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
888 *** negative *** The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!
63 *** negative *** I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
775 *** negative *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
777 *** negative *** HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
771 *** negative *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
773 *** negative *** I'm tired of the inept service.
779 *** negative *** This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
76 *** positive *** I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
73 *** negative *** The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
3058 *** negative *** they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
70 *** positive *** It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
2973 *** positive *** It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.
3055 *** positive *** It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.
2976 *** negative *** They only stay charged a little over an hour.
2977 *** negative *** Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
2974 *** positive *** It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
2975 *** negative *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
1043 *** negative *** Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
1040 *** negative *** Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
1046 *** negative *** I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
1049 *** negative *** Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
1048 *** positive *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1682 *** positive *** As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
1684 *** positive *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
1686 *** positive *** Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
1689 *** positive *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1268 *** negative *** Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
668 *** positive *** the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
265 *** negative *** No tutorials on the display.
661 *** negative *** There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.
3021 *** negative *** For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
8 *** positive *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1467 *** negative *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
1316 *** negative *** The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
1315 *** negative *** It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
319 *** positive *** It is super easy to use.
312 *** positive *** The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
311 *** positive *** The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
310 *** positive *** I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
315 *** positive *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
314 *** positive *** I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
2020 *** negative *** I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
2021 *** negative *** This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
440 *** positive *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
1330 *** positive *** This is what I call a good after sales service.
1332 *** negative *** Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.
2299 *** positive *** You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
2292 *** positive *** The ease of use is wonderful.
2291 *** positive *** There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
2290 *** positive *** I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
2296 *** negative *** You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
2568 *** positive *** I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
2140 *** positive *** All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
2561 *** negative *** I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
2563 *** positive *** Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.
2565 *** positive *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2368 *** positive *** He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
2362 *** positive *** Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
2360 *** positive *** Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
2587 *** negative *** One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
659 *** positive *** I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.
2585 *** positive *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
1867 *** negative *** I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
1869 *** positive ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
961 *** negative ***   This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
969 *** negative *** The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
2101 *** positive *** Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.
2106 *** positive *** It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.

2105 *** positive *** It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
30 *** positive *** Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
2637 *** positive *** Delivery was early too.
2636 *** negative *** the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
2631 *** positive *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2632 *** positive *** I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
878 *** negative *** The tech store I purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.
879 *** positive *** and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
871 *** negative *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
2741 *** negative *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
2034 *** negative *** I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
2745 *** positive *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
2032 *** negative *** The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.
2747 *** positive *** Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
2030 *** negative *** None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
2749 *** positive *** Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
2748 *** positive *** Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.
890 *** negative *** Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
899 *** positive *** The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
1964 *** negative *** This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.
1966 *** negative *** It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
768 *** negative *** This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
2961 *** negative *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
2960 *** positive *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
2963 *** positive *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
2962 *** negative *** This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
762 *** negative *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
763 *** negative *** Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
1783 *** positive *** It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
2969 *** positive *** The laptop was very easy to set up.
3049 *** negative *** Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).
3048 *** negative *** I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
1610 *** positive *** My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
3045 *** negative *** Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.
3047 *** negative *** (Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
1078 *** positive *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1076 *** negative *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
1075 *** negative *** It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
1072 *** positive *** Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
1070 *** negative *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
1071 *** positive *** I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
1674 *** positive *** All for such a great price.
1675 *** positive *** It's color is even cool.
1676 *** positive *** Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
1097 *** negative ***  I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
678 *** positive *** and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
675 *** positive *** 10 plus hours of battery...
676 *** positive *** super fast processor and really nice graphics card..
670 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
671 *** positive *** This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
1418 *** negative ***   Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
1419 *** negative ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
1410 *** negative *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1411 *** negative *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1412 *** negative *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
1413 *** negative *** Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
1414 *** negative *** The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
1417 *** negative ***   The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
1322 *** negative *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
1327 *** negative *** But the arm velcro is torn after one use.
1329 *** positive *** The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
1524 *** positive *** If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
1254 *** negative *** After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).
1252 *** negative *** Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
1529 *** positive *** A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
1258 *** negative *** It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.
1259 *** positive *** Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
308 *** negative *** On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
309 *** positive *** Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
301 *** positive *** I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
302 *** positive *** I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.
2359 *** positive *** The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.
2352 *** positive *** A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.
2353 *** positive *** They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.
2350 *** positive *** I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
2351 *** positive *** Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker.
2357 *** negative *** I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.
1895 *** negative *** Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.
1890 *** negative *** Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.
1892 *** negative *** I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
1893 *** negative *** Three weeks after I bought the netbook, the screen quit working.
2137 *** positive *** i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
2134 *** positive *** I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch.
2133 *** positive *** But you must get the 15 inch.
2130 *** positive *** I also liked the glass screen.
950 *** positive ***   The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
953 *** negative ***   Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.
952 *** negative *** The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
956 *** negative ***   I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.
2649 *** positive *** The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.
2644 *** positive *** It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!
2645 *** positive *** I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.
2003 *** negative *** Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.
2000 *** positive *** Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
2001 *** positive *** Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.
2004 *** positive *** If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
475 *** negative *** They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
2009 *** negative ***   The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
667 *** positive *** The battery is really long.
504 *** positive *** When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great.
1798 *** negative *** And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.
2914 *** positive *** Price and purpose is awesome!
2916 *** negative *** The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
2917 *** negative *** The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.
2919 *** negative *** I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.
714 *** positive *** I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.
713 *** positive *** I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.
1796 *** negative *** Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
711 *** negative *** Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.
1794 *** positive *** I love the solid machined aluminum frame, and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I've used.
3024 *** negative *** My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
1069 *** negative *** The Bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done.
1068 *** negative *** I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
1061 *** positive *** Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
1063 *** positive *** Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
1062 *** negative *** The only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.
1066 *** positive *** One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10
1669 *** negative *** It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!
1668 *** negative *** The only bad part is the size/weight.
1660 *** positive *** Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
1087 *** negative *** EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.
1086 *** negative *** EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED (THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST) OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED.
593 *** negative *** After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.
1084 *** negative *** THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.
1082 *** negative *** Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
597 *** positive *** The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
599 *** positive *** It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.
1089 *** negative *** Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.
1088 *** negative *** A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.
2828 *** positive *** Excellent speed for processing data.
2824 *** positive *** Simple to use, and great graphics.
2827 *** positive *** This computer I used daily nice compact design.
2820 *** positive *** Fast, great visual!
2821 *** negative *** Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
2823 *** positive *** This is a great little computer for the price.
1409 *** negative *** But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.
1408 *** positive *** Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explantory in use.
1401 *** negative *** so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
1400 *** negative *** with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
1407 *** negative *** My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
1406 *** negative *** Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.
448 *** positive *** Also the display is exceptional!
1338 *** negative *** The brand is tarnished in my heart.
443 *** positive *** Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.
441 *** positive *** Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.
1336 *** positive *** So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.
446 *** positive *** I love the glass touchpad.
445 *** positive *** Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba's reputation for laptops it's great!
444 *** positive *** Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.
696 *** positive *** I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
697 *** positive *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
39 *** negative *** The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
38 *** positive *** In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).
1541 *** positive *** The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.
36 *** negative *** This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.
35 *** negative *** Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.
1535 *** positive *** However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
1534 *** negative *** I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.
1531 *** positive *** The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
1530 *** positive *** Its also FUN to use!
648 *** negative *** Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.
1538 *** positive *** The design is awesome, quality is unprecedented.
338 *** negative *** My only disappointment with the 13" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).
335 *** positive *** The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.
334 *** positive *** It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).
337 *** positive *** However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
333 *** positive *** It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.
2346 *** positive *** I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.
2349 *** positive *** The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.
2348 *** positive *** The unibody design is edgy and durable.
1888 *** negative *** Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed (except for speaker grill) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all.
1887 *** negative *** Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.
2124 *** positive *** Mostly I love the drag and drop feature.
948 *** negative ***   The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.
2129 *** positive *** It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.
2128 *** positive *** I liked the aluminum body.
942 *** negative ***   Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken (manuf issue).
940 *** positive ***   I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty, you will probably need it!
941 *** negative *** I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
2653 *** negative *** The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).
2656 *** positive *** This is a great value for the money.
2655 *** positive *** Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.
2654 *** positive *** Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.
132 *** negative *** For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
130 *** negative *** but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.
138 *** positive *** only good thing is the graphics quality.
2018 *** negative *** The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.
2015 *** negative *** It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
2011 *** negative ***   The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
2010 *** negative ***   Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
2902 *** positive *** I have found also, it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access;
2901 *** positive *** I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
2904 *** positive *** I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.
2909 *** negative *** Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
700 *** negative *** Speakers doesn't sound that great.
701 *** negative *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
80 *** positive *** Great laptop that offers many great features!
81 *** positive *** Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
1658 *** positive *** Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
1659 *** positive *** Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
1650 *** positive *** With the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.
1651 *** positive *** And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
1657 *** positive *** Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.
1654 *** positive *** It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.
582 *** positive *** The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
581 *** positive *** I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
1984 *** positive *** Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.
1633 *** positive *** As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
2839 *** negative *** the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.
2837 *** negative *** the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
2833 *** positive *** the laptop preformed pretty well.
1436 *** negative *** I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.
1434 *** negative *** More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.
1438 *** negative *** Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.
1348 *** negative *** in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.
451 *** positive *** It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
452 *** positive *** (I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
454 *** positive *** The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
455 *** positive *** iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
456 *** positive *** The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons.
1347 *** negative *** they had to replace the motherboard in April
657 *** negative *** It bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.
655 *** positive *** It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.
652 *** positive *** It was a great laptop, ran great and was really fast.
1504 *** positive *** It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
3082 *** negative *** This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;
1992 *** negative *** Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.
569 *** positive *** But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
326 *** positive *** I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
327 *** positive *** Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.
329 *** negative *** I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).
2332 *** positive *** It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.
2335 *** positive *** The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.
2336 *** positive *** I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;
2337 *** positive *** the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.
2338 *** positive *** I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.
2339 *** positive *** I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.
1597 *** positive *** I previously purchased a 13" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (If I am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.
3074 *** positive *** The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;
3075 *** positive *** I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.
1592 *** positive *** Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
2954 *** negative *** It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user, that makes it run way to slow.
3079 *** negative *** I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
2488 *** negative *** The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
2486 *** positive *** The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
2487 *** positive *** It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.
2482 *** positive *** We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
2481 *** positive *** It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC's.
2248 *** positive *** In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.
2246 *** positive *** It has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.
2247 *** positive *** iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.
2242 *** positive *** The graphics are stunning.
2243 *** positive *** It's wonderful for computer gaming.
995 *** negative *** It did fairly well, other than it's poor performance, overheating and occational blue screen.
2465 *** positive *** Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of "extra key", etc.
2466 *** positive *** I love the keyboard.
2460 *** positive *** It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
990 *** negative *** The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.
2463 *** positive *** It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.
2469 *** positive *** This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.
120 *** negative *** The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.
124 *** negative *** It is not ideal for children because of the temp.
128 *** negative *** this is my second one and the same problem, bad video card  unreliable overall, this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.
1295 *** negative *** As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
2792 *** negative *** The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
2063 *** negative *** Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
2796 *** negative *** This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
2065 *** negative *** After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
2067 *** positive *** I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.
2666 *** negative *** The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
2660 *** negative *** The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.
1748 *** negative *** Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.
2668 *** negative *** The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
2669 *** negative *** Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
2938 *** negative *** I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.
2939 *** positive *** This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
2936 *** positive *** Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
2937 *** positive *** I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
2934 *** positive *** The internet speed is spectacular.
2935 *** negative *** The battery life is probably an hour at best.
2932 *** negative *** To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
2933 *** positive *** The graphics are great.
1647 *** positive *** And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
1646 *** positive *** But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
1641 *** negative *** I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
1649 *** positive *** And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
1648 *** positive *** And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
578 *** positive *** The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
572 *** positive *** 10 hours of battery life is really something else....
571 *** positive *** very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
577 *** positive *** It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
2808 *** negative *** Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
2809 *** negative *** I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.
2806 *** negative *** the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.
2807 *** negative *** the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
2805 *** negative *** little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
1420 *** negative ***  Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
1423 *** negative *** My problem was with DELL Customer Service.
1425 *** negative *** In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
1427 *** positive *** BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
1426 *** positive *** I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
733 *** negative *** Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
732 *** negative *** Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
735 *** negative *** I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.
1358 *** negative *** Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
469 *** negative *** I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.
1351 *** negative *** I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
2153 *** positive *** The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
1357 *** negative *** After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.
460 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
462 *** negative *** Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
2159 *** positive *** The battery life is also relatively good.
1511 *** positive *** There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
357 *** positive *** Keyboard is reasonable size.
356 *** positive *** great battery life.
