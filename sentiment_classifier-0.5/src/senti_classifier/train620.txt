344 *** negative *** It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
347 *** negative *** pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
340 *** positive *** They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
348 *** positive *** i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
349 *** positive *** i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
2318 *** positive *** Wonderful zooming.
2314 *** positive *** Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
2315 *** positive *** OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.
2311 *** positive *** The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
296 *** positive *** Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.
295 *** positive *** The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.
293 *** negative *** Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.
291 *** negative *** Not to mention it has shit gigs.
271 *** negative *** MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.
273 *** negative *** Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
274 *** negative *** The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.
275 *** negative *** It is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.
277 *** negative *** The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used, and the command prompt would not work at all.
278 *** negative *** The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;
279 *** negative *** The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.
2260 *** positive *** The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
2261 *** positive *** The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!
2266 *** negative *** As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.
2267 *** positive *** As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;
2443 *** positive *** Boots up fast and runs great!
2447 *** positive *** Its fast, has High definition quality in the videos.
2448 *** positive *** The pictures are clear as can be.
108 *** negative *** It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, "74%, plugged in, not charging"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.
109 *** negative *** Then it ceased charging at all.
102 *** positive *** The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
103 *** negative *** The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.
101 *** positive *** I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
107 *** negative *** My laptop now has no battery.
105 *** negative *** That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.
2047 *** negative *** I will never buy another computer from Dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how I was treated by the company.
2049 *** negative *** It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
2689 *** negative *** I dislike the weight and size, cubersome.
2684 *** positive *** Good price.
2686 *** negative *** Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
2680 *** positive *** Again, decent comp for the price, and I was in need of one quickly as my other laptop died on me.
2682 *** negative *** Not sure how I recommend it for quality gaming, as I have a desktop rig for that reason.
99 *** negative *** After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
98 *** negative *** It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
91 *** negative *** Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
90 *** negative *** The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
92 *** negative *** The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
97 *** negative *** First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
1623 *** negative *** With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
1993 *** negative *** Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).
1620 *** negative *** I will never go back to Windows!
1995 *** negative *** I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.
1997 *** negative *** it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.
2860 *** positive *** But, for the cost this is a winner.
2863 *** positive *** The price and features more than met my needs.
2864 *** positive *** I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.
2865 *** positive *** The feature are good enough for what I need.
2867 *** positive *** It has easy to use features and all the speed and power I could ask for.
2868 *** positive *** True quality at a great price!
550 *** negative *** The speakers on it are useless too.
552 *** negative *** Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
1191 *** positive *** Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
1190 *** negative *** Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.
1193 *** negative *** Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.
1192 *** negative *** The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
1197 *** negative *** Finally, the biggest problem has been tech support.
1196 *** negative *** The Apple will run Internet Explorer, but at an amazingly slow rate.
1758 *** negative *** The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.
1757 *** positive *** Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
1175 *** positive *** The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2
1173 *** positive *** (No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
1172 *** positive *** I ordered through MacMall, which saved me the sales tax I would have incurred buying locally.
1171 *** positive *** I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.
1179 *** negative *** First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
1284 *** negative *** Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will "topple" or "slide" down, if you understand what I mean.
1288 *** negative *** We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just "slide" downwards.
1573 *** positive *** It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
684 *** positive *** The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.
687 *** positive *** Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.
1570 *** positive *** company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!
1576 *** positive *** The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.
1574 *** positive *** I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
458 *** negative *** In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.
1349 *** negative *** They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell
1221 *** positive *** I was loving this Netbook because it had an amazing screen and display and was small and light, but after 1 week it stopped openning web pages for me (even after installing new browsers) then eventually it just started giving me a blue screen and crashing everytime I booted it.
407 *** negative *** Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
1372 *** negative ***   We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.
1374 *** negative *** Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
400 *** positive *** The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.
1379 *** negative *** Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.
1378 *** negative *** Windows also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning.
408 *** negative *** I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.
9 *** positive *** The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)
1018 *** positive *** I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.

395 *** negative *** The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
398 *** negative *** Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
2308 *** negative *** The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.
2301 *** negative *** when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
2303 *** positive *** the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.
2305 *** negative *** the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
2307 *** positive *** The Toshiba Net book operates very well.
245 *** positive *** It is light and the battery last a very long time.

240 *** positive *** Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
248 *** negative *** The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.

2274 *** positive *** We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.
2271 *** positive *** We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
2270 *** positive *** A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.
2273 *** positive *** WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!
2279 *** positive *** The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
2455 *** positive *** The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.
2456 *** positive *** Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.
2451 *** positive *** Im glad that it has such great features in it.
2453 *** positive *** Clear picture on it and everything.

171 *** negative *** The battery gets so HOT it is scary.

1977 *** negative *** I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.
2698 *** positive *** I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.
2697 *** negative *** I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
2696 *** negative *** I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.
2694 *** positive *** Peformance is good for the price.
2690 *** negative *** I dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers.
1604 *** positive *** I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.
1968 *** positive *** Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.
1969 *** positive *** I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.
1616 *** positive *** It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
1617 *** positive *** The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
1614 *** positive *** I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
1612 *** positive *** The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.
1613 *** positive *** Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
1962 *** negative *** It was heavy,bulky, and hard to carry because of the size.

1766 *** positive *** It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.
1767 *** positive *** Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.
1764 *** positive *** It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.
1765 *** positive *** It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.
1140 *** negative ***   Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
1149 *** negative *** I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.
2966 *** negative *** The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
1545 *** positive *** I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

698 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.

542 *** negative *** power supply went bad after 2 weeks --
543 *** negative *** after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
540 *** negative *** The service tech said he had tried to duplicate the damage and wasn't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect.
541 *** positive *** The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.
547 *** positive *** It has a faster processor and more ram.
544 *** positive *** I have other computers that get strong signals that don't drop in places that this "net"book loses its signal.
761 *** negative *** With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.
411 *** negative *** Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.
1385 *** negative *** Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.
1383 *** negative *** The right speaker did not work.

388 *** positive *** The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.
259 *** negative *** They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
2196 *** positive *** The powerpoint opened seamlessly in the apple and the mac hooked up to the projector so easily it was almost scary.
253 *** negative *** Another issue I have with it is the battery.

2208 *** positive *** I especially like the backlit keyboard.
2426 *** positive *** I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.
2791 *** positive *** Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.
169 *** negative *** Not easy to carry.
160 *** positive *** They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.
161 *** negative *** For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
162 *** positive *** / awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen...

2738 *** positive *** Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.
1817 *** positive *** Great value, fast delivery- Computer works as if brand new, no problems, very pleased
1810 *** positive *** The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.
1812 *** positive *** The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.
1818 *** positive *** This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.
1819 *** positive *** It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.
1099 *** negative *** It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!
1601 *** negative *** I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and "fixed" the edges by rounding them off.
1600 *** positive *** Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
1602 *** positive *** If you don't feel comfortable doing it yourself, just buy the case and be happy, plus it looks nice, I bought the white one from Best Buy.
1973 *** negative *** Microsoft word was not on it andI had to buy it seperately.
1972 *** negative *** It was hard to handle and operate at school.

2845 *** positive *** I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.
2843 *** positive *** I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!

1776 *** positive *** The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
1771 *** positive *** It is easy to navigate and update programs.
1770 *** positive *** It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.
1778 *** negative *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
1159 *** negative *** I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
1152 *** negative *** Then the hard drive failed;
1551 *** positive *** It is easy to use and lightweight.
1553 *** positive *** Great battery, speed, display.

2993 *** positive *** It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.
3030 *** negative *** It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.

2996 *** negative *** I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.
3034 *** negative *** :-)If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.
533 *** negative *** I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!
532 *** positive *** All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.
3035 *** positive *** It works really well.
2992 *** negative *** Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
1558 *** positive *** The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.
2994 *** negative *** The only downfall is the volume control.
3031 *** positive *** I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
536 *** negative *** I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
429 *** negative *** The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.
1399 *** negative *** the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
1398 *** positive *** although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.
1393 *** negative *** the mouse buttons are hard to push.
1392 *** negative *** sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
427 *** negative *** I bought it from HSN because it was "bundled" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....

2181 *** negative *** Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.

2188 *** positive *** I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.
223 *** positive *** It just works flawlessly!
220 *** negative *** Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.
2213 *** positive *** I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.
2212 *** positive *** The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.

2210 *** positive *** It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.

2506 *** positive *** I was originally concerned that I couldn't view work I had done in college on my Mac because of the PC formatting, but I was even more thrilled to learn of programs like iLife and iWork that allow you to convert your PC documents into readable files on Macs.
2505 *** positive *** and the multiple page viewer ( allows you to press one button to see every separate page currently opened at the same time in one screen) are great for those who are working non stop or just shopping online.
2503 *** positive *** Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.

2728 *** negative *** defective software.
1805 *** positive *** Good for every day computing and web browsing.
1804 *** positive *** While Apple's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products, and their support is great, it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.
1803 *** negative *** My friend just had to replace his entire motherboard, so did my wife, and it looks like I will have to as well.
1256 *** negative *** Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.
1948 *** negative *** You can't even get a satellite card which is why I bought to begin with.

2760 *** positive *** It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.
2765 *** positive *** I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
902 *** negative *** 2 months later, the battery went.
903 *** negative *** They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.
900 *** negative *** Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
907 *** negative *** The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.
905 *** negative *** I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
1842 *** negative ***   The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
908 *** negative *** Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.
1846 *** negative ***   Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture.
1845 *** negative ***   even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.

2612 *** positive *** It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
2611 *** positive *** Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.
2610 *** positive *** It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
2619 *** positive *** Everything I have tried has worked and I never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome.
1906 *** negative ***   Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
1902 *** negative ***   The screen almost looked like a barcode when it froze.
854 *** negative ***   The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.
851 *** negative ***   I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
858 *** negative ***   I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
859 *** negative *** Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.
740 *** positive *** This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
741 *** positive *** Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.
744 *** negative *** The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
745 *** negative *** Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
746 *** negative *** No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
3062 *** positive *** The screen is nice and the images comes very clear, the keyboard and the fit just feels right.

2948 *** negative *** The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.

2941 *** negative *** I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!
2940 *** positive *** Runs smooth and quick.
1050 *** negative *** *=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.
1052 *** negative *** The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
1053 *** negative *** Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
719 *** positive *** It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
1057 *** positive *** Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.
1696 *** positive *** The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.
1793 *** positive *** Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.
1694 *** positive *** Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.
1691 *** negative *** The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.
1698 *** negative *** MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.
613 *** negative *** -Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
610 *** positive *** lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.
617 *** negative *** No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).
614 *** negative *** -When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).
712 *** positive *** I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
1795 *** negative *** Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1472 *** negative *** Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.
1470 *** negative *** The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
1471 *** negative *** And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.
1476 *** positive *** The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
1479 *** positive *** The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.
496 *** negative *** Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.
490 *** negative *** But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.
25 *** positive *** Windows 7 Starter is terrific (no you can't change the background) but I don't need to, I use it just for school work.
26 *** positive *** The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.
27 *** positive *** The ease of set up was terrific.
22 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
23 *** positive *** The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.
29 *** negative *** I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
7 *** positive *** AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)!
2288 *** positive *** Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.
2578 *** negative *** Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.
2574 *** positive *** I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.
2575 *** negative *** The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16" laptop does.
2572 *** positive *** Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).
2571 *** positive *** I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.
2378 *** positive *** It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
2377 *** negative *** The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
2373 *** negative *** The screen takes some getting use to, because it is smaller than the laptop.
2594 *** positive *** It made the computer much easier to use and navigate.
2595 *** positive *** Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
2592 *** positive *** I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.
1085 *** negative *** WHEN TYPING, LETTERS AND SPACES ARE FREQUENTLY OMITTED REQUIRING THE USER TO REDO MANY WORDS AND SENTENCES.
1874 *** negative *** I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
592 *** positive *** My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.
1872 *** negative *** I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS
1878 *** negative *** 1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1879 *** negative *** 2.The wireless card is low quality.
973 *** positive *** With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
2111 *** negative *** I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.
2117 *** negative *** When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.
2622 *** positive *** Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
2620 *** negative *** The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
2621 *** positive *** I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
2626 *** positive *** The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.

2624 *** positive *** The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.
2625 *** positive *** The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
1911 *** negative ***   However the frozen screens kept happening.
1913 *** negative ***   This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
1912 *** negative ***   I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
2756 *** positive *** The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.
2757 *** positive *** I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.
2754 *** positive *** I recommend for word processing and internet users.
2755 *** positive *** I am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite, I like the extra features, I love the windows 7 home premium.
2752 *** positive *** I am using the external speaker- sound is good.
2753 *** positive *** Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
2022 *** negative *** It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.
2751 *** positive *** Good monitor and performed well.
2759 *** positive *** This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!
884 *** negative *** Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.
888 *** negative *** The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!
63 *** negative *** I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.
775 *** negative *** Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.
777 *** negative *** HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!
771 *** negative *** The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
773 *** negative *** I'm tired of the inept service.
779 *** negative *** This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
76 *** positive *** I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
73 *** negative *** The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!
3058 *** negative *** they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
70 *** positive *** It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
2973 *** positive *** It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.
3055 *** positive *** It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.
2976 *** negative *** They only stay charged a little over an hour.
2977 *** negative *** Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?
2974 *** positive *** It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
2975 *** negative *** The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
1043 *** negative *** Support has been lackluster and now I just want a refund.
1040 *** negative *** Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.
1046 *** negative *** I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
1049 *** negative *** Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.
1048 *** positive *** -Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1682 *** positive *** As a user of a PC, I will will admit that the macBook Pro has a better running system in which I found myself "Getting the job done quicker.
1684 *** positive *** Browsing, also, was no problem for me when I used itunes ( which usually slows down my PC ).
1686 *** positive *** Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.
1689 *** positive *** It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.
1268 *** negative *** Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
668 *** positive *** the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.
265 *** negative *** No tutorials on the display.
661 *** negative *** There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.
3021 *** negative *** For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
8 *** positive *** Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.
1467 *** negative *** For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.
1316 *** negative *** The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
1315 *** negative *** It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.
319 *** positive *** It is super easy to use.
312 *** positive *** The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.
311 *** positive *** The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.
310 *** positive *** I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.
315 *** positive *** I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!
314 *** positive *** I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
2020 *** negative *** I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.
2021 *** negative *** This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.
440 *** positive *** I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
1330 *** positive *** This is what I call a good after sales service.
1332 *** negative *** Do you think I purposely "destroy" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.
2299 *** positive *** You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
2292 *** positive *** The ease of use is wonderful.
2291 *** positive *** There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.
2290 *** positive *** I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.
2296 *** negative *** You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.
2568 *** positive *** I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
2140 *** positive *** All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
2561 *** negative *** I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.
2563 *** positive *** Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.
2565 *** positive *** I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.
2368 *** positive *** He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.
2362 *** positive *** Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer/printer we will buy.
2360 *** positive *** Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.
2587 *** negative *** One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.
659 *** positive *** I reinstalled windows through the recovery discs and everything seemed good again.
2585 *** positive *** It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
1867 *** negative *** I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
1869 *** positive ***   I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.
961 *** negative ***   This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!
969 *** negative *** The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
2101 *** positive *** Which is great I am running Vista Business and scored a 5.X on the index I have never seen a windows machine have a total score in the 5's.
2106 *** positive *** It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.

2105 *** positive *** It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.
30 *** positive *** Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.
2637 *** positive *** Delivery was early too.
2636 *** negative *** the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.
2631 *** positive *** Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
2632 *** positive *** I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
878 *** negative *** The tech store I purchased this from sent it back,,,,,eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later.
879 *** positive *** and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.
871 *** negative *** I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
2741 *** negative *** I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.
2034 *** negative *** I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
2745 *** positive *** A cheaper price should not equal a "cheap" product.
2032 *** negative *** The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.
2747 *** positive *** Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.
2030 *** negative *** None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
2749 *** positive *** Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.
2748 *** positive *** Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.
890 *** negative *** Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.
899 *** positive *** The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
1964 *** negative *** This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.
1966 *** negative *** It did not have all the features I expected it to have.
768 *** negative *** This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
2961 *** negative *** My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
2960 *** positive *** The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
2963 *** positive *** Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.
2962 *** negative *** This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
762 *** negative *** I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
763 *** negative *** Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
1783 *** positive *** It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
2969 *** positive *** The laptop was very easy to set up.
3049 *** negative *** Yeah, of course smarty pants "fix it now")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).
3048 *** negative *** I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a "different" computer.
1610 *** positive *** My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!
3045 *** negative *** Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.
3047 *** negative *** (Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.
1078 *** positive *** The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1076 *** negative *** System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
1075 *** negative *** It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
1072 *** positive *** Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.
1070 *** negative *** Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.
1071 *** positive *** I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
1674 *** positive *** All for such a great price.
1675 *** positive *** It's color is even cool.
1676 *** positive *** Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
1097 *** negative ***  I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1/2 YEARS!
678 *** positive *** and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)
675 *** positive *** 10 plus hours of battery...
676 *** positive *** super fast processor and really nice graphics card..
670 *** positive *** Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
671 *** positive *** This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
1418 *** negative ***   Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
1419 *** negative ***   I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
1410 *** negative *** There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1411 *** negative *** There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.
1412 *** negative *** I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.
1413 *** negative *** Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.
1414 *** negative *** The graphics were awful and the warranty isn't even worth the cheap payment on the computer.
1417 *** negative ***   The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
1322 *** negative *** So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
1327 *** negative *** But the arm velcro is torn after one use.
1329 *** positive *** The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
1524 *** positive *** If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.
1254 *** negative *** After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).
1252 *** negative *** Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.
1529 *** positive *** A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
1258 *** negative *** It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.
1259 *** positive *** Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
308 *** negative *** On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
309 *** positive *** Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.
301 *** positive *** I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
302 *** positive *** I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.
2359 *** positive *** The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.
2352 *** positive *** A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect.
2353 *** positive *** They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.
2350 *** positive *** I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
2351 *** positive *** Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker.
2357 *** negative *** I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.
1895 *** negative *** Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.
1890 *** negative *** Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.
1892 *** negative *** I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
1893 *** negative *** Three weeks after I bought the netbook, the screen quit working.
2137 *** positive *** i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.
2134 *** positive *** I preferred the fit and feel of the 13 inch.
2133 *** positive *** But you must get the 15 inch.
2130 *** positive *** I also liked the glass screen.
950 *** positive ***   The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.
953 *** negative ***   Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.
952 *** negative *** The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
956 *** negative ***   I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.
2649 *** positive *** The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.
2644 *** positive *** It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!
2645 *** positive *** I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.
2003 *** negative *** Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.
2000 *** positive *** Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.
2001 *** positive *** Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.
2004 *** positive *** If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;
475 *** negative *** They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
2009 *** negative ***   The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
667 *** positive *** The battery is really long.
504 *** positive *** When I called Sony the Customer Service was Great.
1798 *** negative *** And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.
2914 *** positive *** Price and purpose is awesome!
2916 *** negative *** The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
2917 *** negative *** The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.
2919 *** negative *** I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.
714 *** positive *** I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.
713 *** positive *** I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.
1796 *** negative *** Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
711 *** negative *** Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.
1794 *** positive *** I love the solid machined aluminum frame, and the keyboard is the best of any laptop I've used.
3024 *** negative *** My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
1069 *** negative *** The Bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1/2 way done.
1068 *** negative *** I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
1061 *** positive *** Every driver on the drivers/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.
1063 *** positive *** Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
1062 *** negative *** The only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.
1066 *** positive *** One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10
1669 *** negative *** It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!
1668 *** negative *** The only bad part is the size/weight.
1660 *** positive *** Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.
1087 *** negative *** EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.
1086 *** negative *** EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED (THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST) OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED.
593 *** negative *** After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.
1084 *** negative *** THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.
1082 *** negative *** Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.
597 *** positive *** The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
599 *** positive *** It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.
1089 *** negative *** Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.
1088 *** negative *** A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.
2828 *** positive *** Excellent speed for processing data.
2824 *** positive *** Simple to use, and great graphics.
2827 *** positive *** This computer I used daily nice compact design.
2820 *** positive *** Fast, great visual!
2821 *** negative *** Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.
2823 *** positive *** This is a great little computer for the price.
1409 *** negative *** But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.
1408 *** positive *** Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explantory in use.
1401 *** negative *** so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.
1400 *** negative *** with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
1407 *** negative *** My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.
1406 *** negative *** Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.
448 *** positive *** Also the display is exceptional!
1338 *** negative *** The brand is tarnished in my heart.
443 *** positive *** Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.
441 *** positive *** Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.
1336 *** positive *** So what if the laptops/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.
446 *** positive *** I love the glass touchpad.
445 *** positive *** Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba's reputation for laptops it's great!
444 *** positive *** Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.
696 *** positive *** I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
697 *** positive *** The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
39 *** negative *** The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.
38 *** positive *** In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).
1541 *** positive *** The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.
36 *** negative *** This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.
35 *** negative *** Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.
1535 *** positive *** However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
1534 *** negative *** I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.
1531 *** positive *** The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
1530 *** positive *** Its also FUN to use!
648 *** negative *** Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.
1538 *** positive *** The design is awesome, quality is unprecedented.
338 *** negative *** My only disappointment with the 13" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).
335 *** positive *** The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.
334 *** positive *** It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).
337 *** positive *** However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
333 *** positive *** It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.
2346 *** positive *** I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.
2349 *** positive *** The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.
2348 *** positive *** The unibody design is edgy and durable.
1888 *** negative *** Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed (except for speaker grill) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all.
1887 *** negative *** Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.
2124 *** positive *** Mostly I love the drag and drop feature.
948 *** negative ***   The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.
2129 *** positive *** It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.
2128 *** positive *** I liked the aluminum body.
942 *** negative ***   Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken (manuf issue).
940 *** positive ***   I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty, you will probably need it!
941 *** negative *** I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
2653 *** negative *** The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).
2656 *** positive *** This is a great value for the money.
2655 *** positive *** Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.
2654 *** positive *** Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.
132 *** negative *** For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
130 *** negative *** but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.
138 *** positive *** only good thing is the graphics quality.
2018 *** negative *** The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.
2015 *** negative *** It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.
2011 *** negative ***   The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.
2010 *** negative ***   Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
2902 *** positive *** I have found also, it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access;
2901 *** positive *** I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
2904 *** positive *** I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.
2909 *** negative *** Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
700 *** negative *** Speakers doesn't sound that great.
701 *** negative *** The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.
80 *** positive *** Great laptop that offers many great features!
81 *** positive *** Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!
1658 *** positive *** Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
1659 *** positive *** Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.
1650 *** positive *** With the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.
1651 *** positive *** And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
1657 *** positive *** Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.
1654 *** positive *** It's applications are terrific, including the replacements for Microsoft office.
582 *** positive *** The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
581 *** positive *** I do transcription work on the side, and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well.
1984 *** positive *** Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.
1633 *** positive *** As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.
2839 *** negative *** the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.
2837 *** negative *** the mouse is way way way to sensitve.
2833 *** positive *** the laptop preformed pretty well.
1436 *** negative *** I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.
1434 *** negative *** More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.
1438 *** negative *** Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.
1348 *** negative *** in May I started having problems with the USB ports not working.
451 *** positive *** It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
452 *** positive *** (I had been a Windows/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.
454 *** positive *** The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
455 *** positive *** iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
456 *** positive *** The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons.
1347 *** negative *** they had to replace the motherboard in April
657 *** negative *** It bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.
655 *** positive *** It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.
652 *** positive *** It was a great laptop, ran great and was really fast.
1504 *** positive *** It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
3082 *** negative *** This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;
1992 *** negative *** Anyway, in early July of this year, the DVD burner stopped working, and the computer stared having issues with power supply.
569 *** positive *** But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
326 *** positive *** I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
327 *** positive *** Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.
329 *** negative *** I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).
2332 *** positive *** It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.
2335 *** positive *** The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.
2336 *** positive *** I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;
2337 *** positive *** the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.
2338 *** positive *** I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.
2339 *** positive *** I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.
1597 *** positive *** I previously purchased a 13" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (If I am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.
3074 *** positive *** The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice;
3075 *** positive *** I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.
1592 *** positive *** Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled
2954 *** negative *** It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user, that makes it run way to slow.
3079 *** negative *** I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
2488 *** negative *** The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.
2486 *** positive *** The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
2487 *** positive *** It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.
2482 *** positive *** We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.
2481 *** positive *** It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC's.
2248 *** positive *** In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.
2246 *** positive *** It has many great programs, such as ILife, iPhotos and others.
2247 *** positive *** iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.
2242 *** positive *** The graphics are stunning.
2243 *** positive *** It's wonderful for computer gaming.
995 *** negative *** It did fairly well, other than it's poor performance, overheating and occational blue screen.
2465 *** positive *** Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of "extra key", etc.
2466 *** positive *** I love the keyboard.
2460 *** positive *** It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
990 *** negative *** The technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother.
2463 *** positive *** It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.
2469 *** positive *** This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.
120 *** negative *** The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.
124 *** negative *** It is not ideal for children because of the temp.
128 *** negative *** this is my second one and the same problem, bad video card  unreliable overall, this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.
1295 *** negative *** As usual at customer service center, she asked me to hold for a moment while she went to the back-office and compare it with other same model netbooks and discussed it with her colleague (I could see them).
2792 *** negative *** The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.
2063 *** negative *** Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
2796 *** negative *** This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
2065 *** negative *** After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
2067 *** positive *** I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.
2666 *** negative *** The only problem is a lack of screen resolutions!
2660 *** negative *** The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.
1748 *** negative *** Typing on the keyboard becomes uncomfortable after extended use due to the sharp edges that your wrists rest on.
2668 *** negative *** The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.
2669 *** negative *** Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki
2938 *** negative *** I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.
2939 *** positive *** This laptop is a great price and has a sleek look.
2936 *** positive *** Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
2937 *** positive *** I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.
2934 *** positive *** The internet speed is spectacular.
2935 *** negative *** The battery life is probably an hour at best.
2932 *** negative *** To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
2933 *** positive *** The graphics are great.
1647 *** positive *** And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
1646 *** positive *** But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
1641 *** negative *** I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
1649 *** positive *** And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.
1648 *** positive *** And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
578 *** positive *** The Final Cut Pro on this laptop is so fast and easy, and I can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer, which is also a mac.
572 *** positive *** 10 hours of battery life is really something else....
571 *** positive *** very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...
577 *** positive *** It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.
2808 *** negative *** Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
2809 *** negative *** I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.
2806 *** negative *** the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer, left right and front.
2807 *** negative *** the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
2805 *** negative *** little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.
1420 *** negative ***  Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
1423 *** negative *** My problem was with DELL Customer Service.
1425 *** negative *** In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
1427 *** positive *** BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
1426 *** positive *** I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.
733 *** negative *** Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.
732 *** negative *** Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
735 *** negative *** I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.
1358 *** negative *** Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.
469 *** negative *** I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.
1351 *** negative *** I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
2153 *** positive *** The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.
1357 *** negative *** After a little more than a year of owning my MacBook Pro, the monitor has completely died.
460 *** negative *** Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.
462 *** negative *** Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.
2159 *** positive *** The battery life is also relatively good.
1511 *** positive *** There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!
357 *** positive *** Keyboard is reasonable size.
356 *** positive *** great battery life.
354 *** negative *** The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
353 *** negative *** From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.
350 *** negative *** also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
359 *** negative *** Charger seems large for this class of computer.
2323 *** positive *** I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use.
2322 *** positive *** The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.
2320 *** positive *** I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.
1444 *** negative *** Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.
280 *** negative *** Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.
285 *** negative *** It doesnt work worth a damn.
286 *** negative *** The display is beyond horrible.
260 *** negative *** oh yeah, and if the fancy webcam breaks guess who you have to send it to to get it fixed?
264 *** negative *** Vista is a nightmare.
2491 *** positive *** First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
2490 *** negative *** 2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into
2492 *** positive *** Amazing Quality!
2495 *** negative *** The flaws are, this computer is not for computer gamers because of the OS X.
